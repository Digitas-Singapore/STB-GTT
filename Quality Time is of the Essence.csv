everything’s going to be open, essentially. you do not see a western style shutdown. its a public holiday and so busy. you will need to book in advance. those of the right cuisine will do traditional christmas meals.

my friend and i would like to visit the region of isaan in a few weeks, staying for several months. we would like to have a chilled trip. doing relaxed hiking and camping, maybe going in a buddhist monastery and staying there for a few weeks. meeting some locals to have interesting talks. maybe going a bit through the cities. the focus is more on a calm trip without that much action.
my question would be if this is currently possible:
1. can we find an open monastery right now?
2. can we hike through the country. i heard some national parks are closed. is it still possible to find nice places to hike and camp?
3. can you hike without mask if you are far away from the cities?
4. how is interaction with locals right now? i heard in sri lanka they now fear white people as potential conductor of covid-19. is it similiar in thailand?
5. there are several lockdowns in the country, how is it in isan. are restaurants open? are the hotels open? are there still enough activities for open fun outside?

tourism contributes between 15 and 20% of the gdp, that includes ancillary services, such as shopping, supply chains, etc. direct contributions are closer to 10 to 12% as jay mentioned. and while international arrivals have dwindled to record lows, domestic tourism is still contributing a small portion to assist the industry.
but the thai economy is not on its knees nor anywhere near being on its knees. nor are people starving. with the exception of those directly working in tourism (hotel staff, tour bus drivers, tour guides, entertainment, tourist restaurants) most people still have their former employment. those in tourism that were let go, have in large part left the tourist destinations and returned to their villages where they have family. thais don't let their fellow thais starve.
when the initial shutdowns happened, food pantries showed up all over the place, there were even some in our neighborhood. but over time as folks who were displaced found new work, the amount of food needed dropped off. now food donated takes quite a while before the supply is depleted.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g297930-i9925-k13458287-December_2021-Patong_Kathu_Phuket.html,Dec-21,MOTALAW,"Crewe, United...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MOTALAW?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,50,0,50.0,0,0,0.0,0,50,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,50,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,50,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,200,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,50,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,50,0,50,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,40000,"[""['freyac',"", ""'facts',"", ""'tourism',"", ""'contribute',"", ""'15',"", ""'20',"", ""'gdp',"", ""'include',"", ""'ancillary',"", ""'service',"", ""'shop',"", ""'supply',"", ""'chain',"", ""'direct',"", ""'contributions',"", ""'closer',"", ""'10',"", ""'12',"", ""'jay',"", ""'international',"", ""'arrivals',"", ""'dwindle',"", ""'record',"", ""'low',"", ""'domestic',"", ""'tourism',"", ""'contribute',"", ""'small',"", ""'portion',"", ""'assist',"", ""'industry',"", ""'thai',"", ""'economy',"", ""'knees',"", ""'near',"", ""'knees',"", ""'people',"", ""'starve',"", ""'exception',"", ""'directly',"", ""'work',"", ""'tourism',"", ""'hotel',"", ""'staff',"", ""'tour',"", ""'bus',"", ""'drivers',"", ""'tour',"", ""'guide',"", ""'entertainment',"", ""'tourist',"", ""'restaurants',"", ""'people',"", ""'former',"", ""'employment',"", ""'tourism',"", ""'large',"", ""'part',"", ""'tourist',"", ""'destinations',"", ""'villages',"", ""'family',"", ""'thais',"", ""'fellow',"", ""'thais',"", ""'starve',"", ""'initial',"", ""'shutdowns',"", ""'happen',"", ""'food',"", ""'pantries',"", ""'show',"", ""'place',"", ""'neighborhood',"", ""'time',"", ""'folks',"", ""'displace',"", ""'new',"", ""'work',"", ""'amount',"", ""'food',"", ""'drop',"", ""'food',"", ""'donate',"", ""'quite',"", ""'supply',"", ""'deplete']""]",False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

good luck trip!","i guess it depends on your taste for the finer things and spending on 'nightlife'. for a backpacker, $5k (~$330/day) would be a boatload of money. eating street food or casual restaurants and a few beers would cost you about $30-40 at most. transportation and visiting the sights maybe $20-100 depending. leaving you a couple hundred per day which you could spend on nightlife but even that would be extravagant. unless you have super expensive tastes and spend like a drunken sailor on the nightlife, your budget should be more than enough.
i can't speak to how well you'd be accepted as a black male, though the thais are generally very accepting of foreigners. i'd heard that there's been (pre-covid) a criminal element from africa that's makes people wary of black people in general but you'll need to dig deeper on this. as a solo traveler in thailand i found it easy to meet other travelers. it may depend on where you stay, though.
in terms of places to visit, don't miss the fantastic thai temples in bangkok. the temple of the emerald buddha/national palace, wat po, wat arun are some of the most popular. a tour of the klongs in a long tail boat is a must see, imho. if you can, try to make a day trip to ayuthaya for the ruined temples. the floating market is great but couple it with a tour of the surrounding canals.
i haven't been to pattaya in decades but my impression is that it's mostly about the nightlife with little else to do. it's not a great beach destination. imo. others may correct me on this. if you're not married to spending 8 days in pattaya consider splitting the time with koh samui or krabi or phuket. much better beach destinations and still nightlife around.

this is just my personal opinion but delay your family vacation as london is suffering, kids are not at school, people are losing jobs, shop's are closed, hotels are closed for tourists and only catering for essential workers.

!","well, i just wanted to share than in the middle of all this, we went ahead with our trip to goa last week of march, trip was booked since january when things were really on their way to normalcy and since the whole family was travelling, no one was wanting to cancel. flying experience from delhi via vistara was quite safe - this time we made one change, since we didn't think using pools in hotels would be safe, we booked private villas with private pools via airbnb and some other sites for part of the stay. stayed at santana the last few nights and one of their two pools remains totally empty - my younger son used that one - somehow the other guests believed that pool wasn't operational - good for us :). went to all the hot spots, took tables distanced from others, places like thalassa and titlie (the hot new nightclub in town) were crowded but you could still maintain distance if you stayed at or around your table, it's mostly the bar counter areas in these places that had the crowds hanging around (mostly youngsters)...we had no desire to do that and enjoyed the spectacle from our table, including the dances and live singing ...overall good fun and came back safe and sound.....was missing the usual goa vibe, hope things get normalised soon.....this is no way to live

9,1411,UAE,"i’ve stayed twice fine margins them.
we’ve gold deluxe corner suite fairmont well gold deluxe standard room - location fairmont last years seen lot within close proximity. it’s easier reach mainland.
the lounge bar area ( it’s called honor bar) isn’t huge i’d plentiful you’re comparing 5* hotels dubai. decent afternoon selection snacks, cakes somewhere escape hour afternoon.
be mindful you’re travelling kids don’t believe kids allowed evening drinks served noticed visitors kids post 6pm. young daughter went lounge evenings little grandparents quite surprised see kids don’t they’re officially allowed stayed wasn’t separate family section changed.
having gold room gave complimentary access hrs kids club otherwise chargeable dhs 50 per session 2015 & 2018 stayed changed. you’re travelling kids it’s irrelevant you.
one favourite restaurants, little miss india, fairmont well worth visit.
the standard gold rooms wow factor hotel lovely. it’s downside pools quite busy, separate adults pool generally busy day guests family pool direct doesn’t large amount beds sand.....
it kids pool wee ones it’s kids club good complete climbing wall splash fountains.
probably issue hubby thought lager choice pool limited. recall whinging paying 50dhs pint lukewarm heineken lol...
anantara - obvious drawback it’s far end crescent. setting anantara fact quite unique style. buffet restaurant buffet fairmont, la carte far eastern favourite liked beach house restaurant outdoor bar area.
both times stayed lagoon room stay upgraded villa half way due electrical issue room!
for swim rooms real bonus, it’s able straight pool, means main pool doesn’t crowded!
there’s small kids club staff lovely there’s pool kids activities going day. kids club fairmont better.
another bonus swim rooms purchase duty free drink freely balcony ( there’s two loungers lagoon access balcony ) well snacks thus saving money, little boat comes selling drinks purchased afternoon mojitos!!
between two, prefer anantara, fine margins lagoon access rooms main bonus.
to sum good i’d pick lagoon access room standard gold room. tip, stayed lagoon access room furthest room block right next bridge access spa. room got afternoon sun due furthest away quite private inflatable lilos sunbathed lagoon never saw soul. lagoons busier middle.
one slight drawback anantara quiet evening, suited fine prefer slightly
busier vibe fairmont suit better.
edited: 9:21 am, february 12,","i’ve stayed in both twice and there are fine margins between them.
we’ve had a gold deluxe corner suite at the fairmont as well as a gold deluxe standard room - i like the location of the fairmont especially as the last few years has seen a lot more about within close proximity. it’s easier to reach the mainland.
the lounge and bar area ( think it’s called honor bar) isn’t huge and i’d say not as plentiful if you’re comparing to other 5* hotels in dubai. it does a decent afternoon selection of snacks, cakes etc and somewhere to escape for an hour or so in the afternoon.
be mindful if you’re travelling with kids as i don’t believe kids are allowed in once evening drinks are served however we noticed on both visitors kids were in post 6pm. as we had our young daughter with us we only went in the lounge a few evenings when our little one was at her grandparents so i was quite surprised to see kids in there as i don’t think they’re officially allowed as when we stayed there wasn’t a separate family section but this might have changed.
having a gold room gave us complimentary access for 2 hrs to the kids club otherwise it was chargeable at dhs 50 per session however it was 2015 & 2018 when i stayed so it might have changed. again though if you’re not travelling with kids then it’s irrelevant to you.
one of my favourite restaurants, little miss india, is at the fairmont and well worth a visit.
the standard gold rooms are okay but not wow factor but the hotel itself is lovely. it’s downside for me is the pools are quite busy, it has a separate adults pool but is generally busy with day guests and the family pool direct doesn’t have a large amount of beds and most are on the sand.....
it has a great kids pool for wee ones and it’s kids club is very good complete with climbing wall and splash fountains.
probably not an issue for most but my hubby thought the lager choice around the pool was limited. i still recall him whinging at paying over 50dhs for a pint of lukewarm heineken lol...
anantara - the obvious drawback is it’s further out being on the far end of the crescent. i like the setting of the anantara and the fact it has quite a unique style. i think the buffet restaurant is better than the buffet at the fairmont, it has a few a la carte and the far eastern was my favourite but i also liked the beach house restaurant and outdoor bar area.
both times we stayed we had a lagoon room but in one stay we were upgraded to a villa half way through due to an electrical issue in our room!
for me the swim up rooms are a real bonus, it’s great just being able to go straight into the pool, it also means the main pool doesn’t get too crowded!
there’s a small kids club and staff are lovely and there’s a few pool kids activities going on through the day. the kids club at the fairmont is better.
another bonus of the swim up rooms is you can purchase duty free and drink them freely on your balcony ( there’s two loungers on each lagoon access balcony ) as well as snacks thus saving money, there is also a little boat that comes around selling drinks and i purchased a few afternoon mojitos!!
between the two, i prefer the anantara, only fine margins but the lagoon access rooms are the main bonus.
to sum up both really good but i’d pick a lagoon access room over a standard gold room. just a tip, we stayed in a lagoon access room which was the furthest room in our block right next to the bridge to access the spa. this was a great room as it got afternoon sun but due to it being furthest away was quite private and we had some inflatable lilos which we just sunbathed on in the lagoon and never saw a soul. the lagoons are busier in the middle.
one slight drawback to the anantara is it can be quiet in the evening, suited us fine but if you prefer a slightly
busier vibe then fairmont might suit you better.

any advice would be greatly appreciated.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g293921-i8432-k13563560-Any_advice_appreciated-Vietnam.html,Any advice appreciated,Newquayone,UK,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Newquayone?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,50,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,200,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,50,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,25000,"[""['couple',"", ""'early',"", ""'60s',"", ""'stay',"", ""'goa',"", ""'january',"", ""'february',"", ""'obviously',"", ""'due',"", ""'current',"", ""'situation',"", ""'india',"", ""'appear',"", ""'2022',"", ""'vietnam',"", ""'peace',"", ""'quiet',"", ""'clean',"", ""'basic',"", ""'accommodation',"", ""'restaurants',"", ""'close',"", ""'mind',"", ""'stay',"", ""'one',"", ""'area',"", ""'whole',"", ""'stay',"", ""'backpackers',"", ""'advice',"", ""'greatly']""]",False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

20,2468,TH,"help opinion island suit best? travelling two children (5 7) husband (hopefully xmas covid pending) somewhere calm, shallow water best. i'm unsure we'll snorkelling beach we? islands walk snorkelling horrendously busy?
other criteria apart busy (aka phi phi) remote plus facilities yoga class boat trip exploring viewpoint two restaurants/bars overloaded backpackers/bars. ko lanta busy perhaps?
the listed islands seemed fit bill. idea golden buddha ko phra thong eco lodge ko jum looks good. ko ngai phayam look beaten/pretty beaches (but perhaps i'm wrong).
the big i'll account ease logistics. we'll coming via train bangkok could stop surat thani trang. need phuket fly home. want couple nights elephant hills ko sok. pick surat thani/drop phuket way perhaps staying ko phra thong/ko jum makes sense. alternatively got train trang easier ko ngai we'd solo trang phuket. pain kids.
finally islands beautiful other? initially interested ko yao noi put beaches views are.
thank you!","can anyone help with opinion on which island would suit me best? i will be travelling with two children (5 and 7) and husband (hopefully xmas 2021 covid pending) so somewhere with calm, shallow water best. i'm unsure if we'll get snorkelling from the beach on any will we? are there any islands with walk in snorkelling that aren't horrendously busy?
other criteria apart from not too busy (aka phi phi) is not too remote plus a few facilities like a yoga class or boat trip or a bit of exploring up to a viewpoint etc and one or two restaurants/bars but not overloaded with backpackers/bars. i think ko lanta would be too busy for us perhaps?
the listed islands seemed to fit the bill. i really like the idea of golden buddha on ko phra thong and there is also an eco lodge on ko jum which looks good. however ko ngai or phayam look a bit more off the beaten/pretty beaches (but perhaps i'm wrong).
the other big thing i'll have to take into account now is ease of logistics. we'll be coming via train from bangkok so could either stop at surat thani or trang. we need to get back up to phuket to fly home. we also want a couple of nights with elephant hills in ko sok. they can pick us up from surat thani/drop us off around phuket way so perhaps staying at ko phra thong/ko jum makes more sense. alternatively if we got the train down to trang it's be easier to get to ko ngai but we'd have to get back up solo from trang to phuket. might be a pain with kids.
finally is any of these islands more beautiful than the other? initially i was interested in ko yao noi but put off as the beaches are not that great though the views are.

25,3033,TH,"much, look kao sok national park. look afield national parks vietnam (phong na). qualified diver (well divemaster dived while) similan islands sound exciting!
i agree, boys definitely men haha, i'm sure busy area new year want travel much (feedback previous itineraries busy :d) going somewhere watersports nature options sounds good.
one last question please: krabi/koh lanta busy now? guess equally changed quieter phuket? case insist beach holiday.
i plan book flights cancel book rooms option realise nobody knows what's going on. december light!
thanks much, feedback super helpful!
eva","thank you both so much, i will have a look at kao sok national park. i didn't think to look further afield and we did like the national parks in vietnam (phong na). i am a qualified diver (well divemaster but i haven't dived in a while) but the similan islands sound exciting!
i agree, the boys are definitely men haha, i'm sure they will like a bit of a busy area for new year and they didn't want to travel too much (feedback was that my previous itineraries were too busy :d) so going somewhere with some watersports and nature options sounds good.
one last question please: is krabi/koh lanta very busy now? i guess this has equally changed or is it quieter than phuket? just in case they insist on a beach holiday.
i only plan to book flights i can cancel and will only book rooms with this option too as i realise nobody knows what's going on. i just hope by december there is light!
thanks very much, your feedback is super helpful!

we spent a month in thailand feb 2020 with our children aged 8 and 11. absolutely amazing experience and so worthwhile doing with them.
our itinerary was:
3 nights bangkok stayed at ibis riverside (great family rooms)
2 nights khao yai stayed at greenleaf and did the afternoon tour on 1st day then full day tour on 2nd day. absolutely amazing place and greenleaf is highly recommended. tours were incredible and we saw wild elephants as well as so much else.
next we got train to ayutthaya and spent afternoon on temple tour before getting night train to chiang mai.
7 nights at chiang mai which again absolutely fabulous with kids. highlights were day with karen tribe native elephants (cant recommended highly enough), sticky waterfalls, big game fishing, grand canyon water park.
then we got direct flight to krabi and taxi to koh lanta for 5 nights. koh lanta amazing and very family friendly. best day ever was a private long-tail trip to koh rok, most magical day of my life with lanta paradise i think was called. also loved car hire and going to national park, and mangrove kayaking trip.
after this we got speedboat to koh mook for 3 nights. very quiet but very pretty and a totally different vibe as not at all developed, no real roads, no 7/11, no atm etc. loved it here, only thing put me off going back was a hotel behind main beach been knocked down and was quite a building site.
next got speedboat to koh lipe for 4 nights. stayed at castaway in family house. absolutely stunning here, like nowhere else i've been. but busier. snorkeling incredible and the water the most beautiful crystal clear turquoise colour. loved it.
then flew from hat yai to bangkok for 1 more night before heading home.
i would love to do it again and would not hesitate to encourage others to travel to thailand with young families. enjoy the planning i'm very envious!!!",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g293915-i3686-k13465309-Jungle_Beach_with_children_ideas_welcome-Thailand.html,Jungle + Beach with children... ideas welcome!,Trudie C,0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/937trudiec?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,50,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,50,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,50,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,50,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,50,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,50,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,200,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,50,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,50,0,200,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,60000,"[""['spend',"", ""'month',"", ""'thailand',"", ""'feb',"", ""'2020',"", ""'children',"", ""'age',"", ""'8',"", ""'11',"", ""'amaze',"", ""'experience',"", ""'worthwhile',"", ""'itinerary',"", ""'3',"", ""'nights',"", ""'bangkok',"", ""'stay',"", ""'ibis',"", ""'riverside',"", ""'family',"", ""'room',"", ""'2',"", ""'nights',"", ""'khao',"", ""'yai',"", ""'stay',"", ""'greenleaf',"", ""'afternoon',"", ""'tour',"", ""'1st',"", ""'day',"", ""'full',"", ""'day',"", ""'tour',"", ""'2nd',"", ""'day',"", ""'amaze',"", ""'place',"", ""'greenleaf',"", ""'highly',"", ""'recommend',"", ""'tour',"", ""'incredible',"", ""'saw',"", ""'wild',"", ""'elephants',"", ""'much',"", ""'train',"", ""'ayutthaya',"", ""'spend',"", ""'afternoon',"", ""'temple',"", ""'tour',"", ""'night',"", ""'train',"", ""'chiang',"", ""'mai',"", ""'7',"", ""'nights',"", ""'chiang',"", ""'mai',"", ""'fabulous',"", ""'kid',"", ""'highlight',"", ""'day',"", ""'karen',"", ""'tribe',"", ""'native',"", ""'elephants',"", ""'recommend',"", ""'highly',"", ""'sticky',"", ""'waterfalls',"", ""'big',"", ""'game',"", ""'fish',"", ""'grand',"", ""'canyon',"", ""'water',"", ""'park',"", ""'direct',"", ""'flight',"", ""'krabi',"", ""'taxi',"", ""'koh',"", ""'lanta',"", ""'5',"", ""'nights',"", ""'koh',"", ""'lanta',"", ""'amaze',"", ""'family',"", ""'friendly',"", ""'day',"", ""'ever',"", ""'private',"", ""'long',"", ""'tail',"", ""'trip',"", ""'koh',"", ""'rok',"", ""'magical',"", ""'day',"", ""'life',"", ""'lanta',"", ""'paradise',"", ""'call',"", ""'car',"", ""'hire',"", ""'national',"", ""'park',"", ""'mangrove',"", ""'kayak',"", ""'trip',"", ""'speedboat',"", ""'koh',"", ""'mook',"", ""'3',"", ""'nights',"", ""'quiet',"", ""'pretty',"", ""'totally',"", ""'different',"", ""'vibe',"", ""'develop',"", ""'real',"", ""'roads',"", ""'7',"", ""'11',"", ""'atm',"", ""'hotel',"", ""'behind',"", ""'main',"", ""'beach',"", ""'knock',"", ""'quite',"", ""'build',"", ""'site',"", ""'speedboat',"", ""'koh',"", ""'lipe',"", ""'4',"", ""'nights',"", ""'stay',"", ""'castaway',"", ""'family',"", ""'house',"", ""'stun',"", ""'nowhere',"", ""'busier',"", ""'snorkel',"", ""'incredible',"", ""'water',"", ""'beautiful',"", ""'crystal',"", ""'clear',"", ""'turquoise',"", ""'colour',"", ""'fly',"", ""'hat',"", ""'yai',"", ""'bangkok',"", ""'1',"", ""'night',"", ""'head',"", ""'home',"", ""'hesitate',"", ""'encourage',"", ""'others',"", ""'travel',"", ""'thailand',"", ""'young',"", ""'families',"", ""'plan',"", ""'envious']""]",False,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

one question i have is how is the weather in may? also, what process is the hoang su phi district in regarding the growing of rice? i know the falling water season occurs differently in northern vietnam, but would like to land myself there during this time. is early may too early? or should i move my visit to the backend of my trip? if i am in northern vietnam during the earlier part of the month, what would be a good suggestion for an area where the falling water season occurs if hoang su phi is not the best option? all information is greatly appreciated.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g1544599-i21344-k13460878-Hoang_Su_Phi_in_May-Ha_Giang_Ha_Giang_Province.html,Hoang Su Phi in May,TheFiveCentDime,US,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheFiveCentDime?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,100.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,100,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,100,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,100,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,40000,"[""['hello',"", ""'travel',"", ""'much',"", ""'possibility',"", ""'stand',"", ""'right',"", ""'coronavirus',"", ""'plan',"", ""'3',"", ""'week',"", ""'trip',"", ""'vietnam',"", ""'future',"", ""'may',"", ""'intent',"", ""'traverse',"", ""'country',"", ""'north',"", ""'south',"", ""'majority',"", ""'north',"", ""'spend',"", ""'time',"", ""'foothills',"", ""'mountains',"", ""'trek',"", ""'remove',"", ""'commercialize',"", ""'hence',"", ""'sapa',"", ""'draw',"", ""'many',"", ""'reason',"", ""'lot',"", ""'interest',"", ""'ha',"", ""'giang',"", ""'appeal',"", ""'many',"", ""'ways',"", ""'one',"", ""'question',"", ""'weather',"", ""'may',"", ""'process',"", ""'hoang',"", ""'su',"", ""'phi',"", ""'district',"", ""'grow',"", ""'rice',"", ""'fall',"", ""'water',"", ""'season',"", ""'occur',"", ""'differently',"", ""'northern',"", ""'vietnam',"", ""'land',"", ""'time',"", ""'early',"", ""'may',"", ""'early',"", ""'move',"", ""'visit',"", ""'backend',"", ""'trip',"", ""'northern',"", ""'vietnam',"", ""'earlier',"", ""'part',"", ""'month',"", ""'good',"", ""'suggestion',"", ""'area',"", ""'fall',"", ""'water',"", ""'season',"", ""'occur',"", ""'hoang',"", ""'su',"", ""'phi',"", ""'information',"", ""'greatly']""]",False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

@scott
thanks for the info, i am sure it will be stunning either way! and yes, part of the plan was ninh binh and pu luong would be in a different stage all together. glad to know i will be within target for that :)
@michael
i unfortunately do not drive, so motorbike is definitely out of the question. most likely bus, private car, or a combo of the two, would be my route of travel (have been considering hoang su phi lodge, and one of their trekking packages). thanks for the info on weather in general for the area, and that of your experience in july. good to know regarding mu cang chai as well. that has also been in consideration (recommendations in detail there would certainly be helpful). for my time, the ha giang loop was not really factored into my itinerary, even though i know it is one of the major draws to the region. perhaps i will reevaluate that.
@john
maybe the end of may might be better to aim for. i could flip my itinerary around and go south to north in this case. my work schedule limits me to travel within the month, and not straddling two. this year i have already factored not be an option, so looking toward 2022 for this. i was starting to plan my trip to vietnam back in 2019, but jumped on an opportunity to go to the philippines with a friend instead, and had a fantastic time (my first intro to se asia). we basically were in ph when covid went into a full scale pandemic, and had some trouble getting home in mid feb due to lockdowns and travel bans. we were very lucky. congrats on your first dose of the vaccine! and yes, hopefully we can all look forward to when travel can resume.
i suppose i have some time to translate the farmers almanac and get a little more acquainted :)
thank you all for your contributions, and certainly have seen other insights from you in other areas of the forum. very much appreciated!

do check out the weather for september as vietnam has several climate areas including monsoons. we ravelled mid february to mid march where it was sandals and shorts south to north with hanoi being the only place that we need trousers and fleeces.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g293921-i8432-k13457100-Best_mid_range_tour_operator_Vietnam-Vietnam.html,Best mid range tour operator Vietnam?,gem1662016,Leigh-on Sea...,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gem1662016?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,50,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,50,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,200,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,50.0,0,0,0,50,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,30000,"[""['vietnam',"", ""'one',"", ""'easiest',"", ""'place',"", ""'tread',"", ""'backpackers',"", ""'hang',"", ""'bus',"", ""'rout',"", ""'everywhere',"", ""'spend',"", ""'month',"", ""'guide',"", ""'central',"", ""'highlands',"", ""'public',"", ""'transport',"", ""'scarce',"", ""'8',"", ""'service',"", ""'mrs',"", ""'ha',"", ""'airport',"", ""'transfer',"", ""'guide',"", ""'tour',"", ""'hoi',"", ""'hue',"", ""'plus',"", ""'guide',"", ""'hanoi',"", ""'mrs',"", ""'ha',"", ""'vietland',"", ""'discovery',"", ""'tour',"", ""'website',"", ""'compromise',"", ""'ensure',"", ""'contact',"", ""'bogus',"", ""'site',"", ""'careful',"", ""'travel',"", ""'lower',"", ""'budget',"", ""'scale',"", ""'meet',"", ""'many',"", ""'youngsters',"", ""'rip',"", ""'dodgy',"", ""'tour',"", ""'operators',"", ""'weather',"", ""'september',"", ""'vietnam',"", ""'climate',"", ""'areas',"", ""'include',"", ""'monsoons',"", ""'ravel',"", ""'mid',"", ""'february',"", ""'mid',"", ""'march',"", ""'sandals',"", ""'short',"", ""'south',"", ""'north',"", ""'hanoi',"", ""'place',"", ""'trousers',"", ""'fleece']""]",False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

asking what to do/stay on ta is a bit like asking 3 rabbis the same question - you’ll get 6 different answers.
we all have different interests.
we go to bali mostly for diving (me and daughter), snorkeling (all of us including mrs pig) and chillaxing (all of us). so our itinerary revolves around these interests/activities.
like “gidget” suggested ubud - amed - gilis then nusa lembongan or even lombok is a possibility and something we would do.
nov 2020 we had a big family holiday planned (me, mrs pig, daughter&bf, son and wife) and we were going to do ubud - amed - gilis - nusa lembongan - sanur/kuta then me an mrs pig off to rottnes island/perth then return to bali before flying home.
we are hoping for nov 2021. as oz will be out we will do something like amed - gilis - nusa lembongan - sanur or
amed - gilis - kuta lombok (southern lombok - laid back place, big beaches with picturesque coastline) - fly back to bali (30mins) - sanur

in laos, we're just thinking of luang prebang....3/4 days maybe?
in malaysia, 2 days in kuala lumpar and 4 days in penang ? is penang worth doing? or are there any other areas more worthwhile?
in thailand, we want to do chiang mai and bangkok plus any other suggestions, you may have.
we love culture, beautiful scenery and great local cuisines. so palaces, temples, markets, sunsets, mountains and waterfalls.
we also want to do an ethical elephant sanctuary and a beautiful river ride.
the thai island, i hope will be beautiful and relaxing...i don't fancy phuket though.

i have been training at muay thai for over a year in my own country, so, that is the context of wanting to go. the last 5 years nearly all of my ""holidays"" have actually be training camps to different countries for my previous sport. so, i do like an activity when i travel.
i will be travelling solo, so, an activity helps too. i'd obviously like to visit some museums, see some sights and culture and a little nightlife. but i'm not really interested in the usual backpacker, heavy drinking scene that some of my friends have gone to thailand for.
thanks again, i will research more!

4. day 4: explore edinburgh, course including royal mile edinburgh castle. visit arthur’s seat kids? not, suggestion (not keen visiting museums)? return train catch edinburgh station pm. suggestions spend day edinburgh appreciated.","thanks everybody for your suggestions. after going through them and doing my own research, i changed my mind a little and came up with the below plan. we will be staying 3d2n in glasgow and 1n1d in edinburgh.
we could not consider a timberbush tour as their tours are cancelled on the days we’ll be in glasgow. could you please review the plan and let me know your suggestions?
1. day 1: we will be reaching glasgow at around 2 pm. is it possible to cover loch lomond and trossachs national park with public transport during rest of the day? i found we can take the train to balloch and get into sweeny’s cruise for a circular tour of loch lomond. but what about trossachs national park? is its entrance also near balloch station? are we better off going by bus if we plan to cover both? please advise.
2. day 2: day return trip by train from glasgow to mallaig via fort william. i know we will spend 10+ hours in train, but we find the opportunity to experience one of the most scenic routes in the world hard to resist. besides the kids also love train ride, so i believe they will not complain.
3. day 3: this is where i am still undecided. this will be our last day in glasgow and we’re considering a day trip to one of these locations by public transport: isle of arran/ayrshire coast/stirling castle/oban/inverness/st andrews. which one of these do you suggest we should go assuming we will never visit scotland again? :-). we should be ok as long as we return to glasgow by 9 pm. will take the next train to edinburgh that night.
4. day 4: explore edinburgh, of course including the royal mile and edinburgh castle. do you think we can visit arthur’s seat too with the kids? if not, any other suggestion (not too keen on visiting museums)? we have a return train to catch from edinburgh station at around 6 pm. so any suggestions to spend the day in edinburgh will be appreciated.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g186485-i107-k13636655-4_days_in_Scotland_with_kids_and_no_car-Scotland.html,4 days in Scotland with kids and no car,Tansen378,The Royal Town of...,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tansen378?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,50,0,0,0.0,0,200,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,50,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,50,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,50,0,0,0,200,50,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,52500,"[""['everybody',"", ""'suggestions',"", ""'research',"", ""'mind',"", ""'little',"", ""'plan',"", ""'stay',"", ""'3d2n',"", ""'glasgow',"", ""'1n1d',"", ""'edinburgh',"", ""'timberbush',"", ""'tour',"", ""'tour',"", ""'cancel',"", ""'days',"", ""'we’ll',"", ""'glasgow',"", ""'plan',"", ""'suggestions',"", ""'1',"", ""'day',"", ""'1',"", ""'reach',"", ""'glasgow',"", ""'2',"", ""'cover',"", ""'loch',"", ""'lomond',"", ""'trossachs',"", ""'national',"", ""'park',"", ""'public',"", ""'transport',"", ""'rest',"", ""'day',"", ""'train',"", ""'balloch',"", ""'sweeny’s',"", ""'cruise',"", ""'circular',"", ""'tour',"", ""'loch',"", ""'lomond',"", ""'trossachs',"", ""'national',"", ""'park',"", ""'entrance',"", ""'near',"", ""'balloch',"", ""'station',"", ""'bus',"", ""'plan',"", ""'cover',"", ""'2',"", ""'day',"", ""'2',"", ""'day',"", ""'trip',"", ""'train',"", ""'glasgow',"", ""'mallaig',"", ""'via',"", ""'fort',"", ""'william',"", ""'spend',"", ""'10',"", ""'hours',"", ""'train',"", ""'opportunity',"", ""'experience',"", ""'one',"", ""'scenic',"", ""'rout',"", ""'world',"", ""'hard',"", ""'resist',"", ""'besides',"", ""'kid',"", ""'train',"", ""'ride',"", ""'complain',"", ""'3',"", ""'day',"", ""'3',"", ""'undecided',"", ""'day',"", ""'glasgow',"", ""'we’re',"", ""'day',"", ""'trip',"", ""'one',"", ""'locations',"", ""'public',"", ""'transport',"", ""'isle',"", ""'arran',"", ""'ayrshire',"", ""'coast',"", ""'stirling',"", ""'castle',"", ""'oban',"", ""'inverness',"", ""'st',"", ""'andrews',"", ""'one',"", ""'assume',"", ""'visit',"", ""'scotland',"", ""'long',"", ""'glasgow',"", ""'9',"", ""'train',"", ""'edinburgh',"", ""'night',"", ""'4',"", ""'day',"", ""'4',"", ""'explore',"", ""'edinburgh',"", ""'course',"", ""'include',"", ""'royal',"", ""'mile',"", ""'edinburgh',"", ""'castle',"", ""'visit',"", ""'arthur’s',"", ""'seat',"", ""'kid',"", ""'suggestion',"", ""'keen',"", ""'visit',"", ""'museums',"", ""'train',"", ""'catch',"", ""'edinburgh',"", ""'station',"", ""'6',"", ""'suggestions',"", ""'spend',"", ""'day',"", ""'edinburgh']""]",True,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

now, i'm trying business visa, big big big big long shot yt clearly typical business client india something that's visiting. something i'm missing able visa now?
also, find way there, fantastic could find backpacker team bit.","this is going to be a unique-ish post.
i run a monetized youtube channel that has over 17m views and 30k subscribers and i've made 10k from it so far.
60% of my viewers are from india, so for a while i was toying with the notion of doing an india trip and shooting vids for my channel there. and besides just my yt channel, from what i've researched india looks like the kind of place that would be incredible to backpack in--a great country for self discovery and spirituality (and also indian food is fire lol). call it 60% pleasure/40% business.
so, after being fully vaccinated, last week i pulled the trigger and bought a covid price $370 ticket from lax-india on 5/6
unfortunately, it's looking like the airline semi-scammed me, since they aren't issuing tourist visas at this time. it's good that i did research, or i very easily could have taken the 20 hour flight, and then been told at the airport i had to get the next trip back home!
now, i'm trying to get a business visa, but this is a big big big big long shot because yt is clearly not a typical business where u have a client in india or something like that and that's why you're visiting. is there something i'm missing here about being able to get a visa now?
also, if i can find a way to get there, it would be fantastic if i could find another backpacker to team up with for a bit.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g293860-i511-k13526460-1st_India_Trip_and_Visa_Question-India.html,1st India Trip and Visa Question,Ben P,0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/benjaminpB3135SA?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,50,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,200,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,50,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,50,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,50,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,50,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,200,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,200,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,50,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,75000,"[""['unique',"", ""'ish',"", ""'post',"", ""'run',"", ""'monetize',"", ""'youtube',"", ""'channel',"", ""'17m',"", ""'view',"", ""'30k',"", ""'subscribers',"", ""'10k',"", ""'far',"", ""'60',"", ""'viewers',"", ""'india',"", ""'toy',"", ""'notion',"", ""'india',"", ""'trip',"", ""'shoot',"", ""'vids',"", ""'channel',"", ""'besides',"", ""'yt',"", ""'channel',"", ""'research',"", ""'india',"", ""'kind',"", ""'place',"", ""'incredible',"", ""'backpack',"", ""'country',"", ""'self',"", ""'discovery',"", ""'spirituality',"", ""'indian',"", ""'food',"", ""'fire',"", ""'call',"", ""'60',"", ""'pleasure',"", ""'40',"", ""'business',"", ""'fully',"", ""'vaccinate',"", ""'week',"", ""'pull',"", ""'trigger',"", ""'buy',"", ""'covid',"", ""'price',"", ""'370',"", ""'ticket',"", ""'lax',"", ""'india',"", ""'5',"", ""'6',"", ""'unfortunately',"", ""'airline',"", ""'semi',"", ""'scammed',"", ""'arent',"", ""'tourist',"", ""'visa',"", ""'time',"", ""'good',"", ""'research',"", ""'easily',"", ""'20',"", ""'hour',"", ""'flight',"", ""'tell',"", ""'airport',"", ""'trip',"", ""'home',"", ""'try',"", ""'business',"", ""'visa',"", ""'big',"", ""'big',"", ""'big',"", ""'big',"", ""'long',"", ""'shoot',"", ""'yt',"", ""'clearly',"", ""'typical',"", ""'business',"", ""'client',"", ""'india',"", ""'something',"", ""'visit',"", ""'something',"", ""'miss',"", ""'able',"", ""'visa',"", ""'way',"", ""'fantastic',"", ""'backpacker',"", ""'team']""]",False,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

a good idea what the average price will be for such a trip. current prices may be influenced by the lack of covid traveling. i recently did jump on some airfares for my family trip this june. i saw turkish airways had a business class promotion for a bit under 3k rt with a short istanbul stop out of atlanta. also consider it may save quite a bit to book a separate ticket to your us departure airport on a different airline than whoever your dubai carrier partners with. take into account leaving enough time to recheck your bags from dubai departure city. personally i would focus on emirates, qatar, and turkish airways as they are either direct from us or offer short connections in cities on route ie istanbul and doha. etihad also has direct flights to abu dhabi from us but i have never checked where their price was lower than the others. last trip we took emirates out of ny but turkish out of atlanta this time was much cheaper and a bit more convenient. also liked the fact turkish was using their 787-9s with their new business class seating out of atl while new york was flying the older 777er seating. a few hours extra in ist shouldn’t be a problem due to their

any thoughts, tips advice greatly appreciated! thanks advance ","hi everyone,
hoping to spend 3.5 weeks in thailand with my partner and 2 kids (6&8) in march/april 2022. i've visited a couple of times before but never with kids. want to keep travel time to a minimum and avoid long distances by road as the younger lad gets car sick esp in the heat. it's our first long haul trip.
would like a mix of affordable luxury accomm and budget options. we'd like to do some kid friendly sightseeing, shopping, nature and beaches- nothing too strenuous.
this is what i've planned so far and would be very grateful for any advice:
bangkok 4 nights centre point sukhumvit 10. sightseeing tour withlocals.com, snake farm and maybe siam park or similar in addition to some general wandering, eating, shopping etc.
sleeper to chiang mai (will book 1st class cabin in advance)
4-5 nights in cm, would love to stay at gaps house if family option available. elephant camp (day trip), night market, maybe cooking class.
fly to phuket and stay for approx 5 nights at centara grand karon
6 nights ko phi phi - phi phi the beach resort
back to phuket for the final week- katathani phuket beach resort. fly home from phuket.
i'm also interested in ko lanta but not sure how to fit in without a very long travel day and not a fan of packing up and moving too much with kids. re no of days my maths might be slightly off but you get the general idea :)
any thoughts, tips and advice greatly appreciated! thanks in advance ",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g293915-i3686-k13548533-Feedback_on_4_week_family_iteniary_BKK_CM_PHKT_Phi_Phi-Thailand.html,"Feedback on 4 week family iteniary BKK, CM, PHKT, Phi Phi",Caroline M,UK,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/T7669WRcarolinem?tab=forum,0,0,100,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,100,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,100,0,100,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,100,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,100,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,100,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,100,0,0,0,100,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,100,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,100000,"[""['hop',"", ""'spend',"", ""'35',"", ""'weeks',"", ""'thailand',"", ""'partner',"", ""'2',"", ""'kid',"", ""'68',"", ""'march',"", ""'april',"", ""'2022',"", ""'visit',"", ""'couple',"", ""'time',"", ""'kid',"", ""'keep',"", ""'travel',"", ""'time',"", ""'minimum',"", ""'avoid',"", ""'long',"", ""'distance',"", ""'road',"", ""'younger',"", ""'lad',"", ""'car',"", ""'sick',"", ""'esp',"", ""'heat',"", ""'long',"", ""'haul',"", ""'trip',"", ""'mix',"", ""'affordable',"", ""'luxury',"", ""'accomm',"", ""'budget',"", ""'options',"", ""'wed',"", ""'kid',"", ""'friendly',"", ""'sightsee',"", ""'shop',"", ""'nature',"", ""'beach',"", ""'strenuous',"", ""'plan',"", ""'far',"", ""'grateful',"", ""'advice',"", ""'bangkok',"", ""'4',"", ""'nights',"", ""'centre',"", ""'point',"", ""'sukhumvit',"", ""'10',"", ""'sightsee',"", ""'tour',"", ""'withlocalscom',"", ""'snake',"", ""'farm',"", ""'siam',"", ""'park',"", ""'similar',"", ""'addition',"", ""'general',"", ""'wander',"", ""'eat',"", ""'shop',"", ""'sleeper',"", ""'chiang',"", ""'mai',"", ""'book',"", ""'1st',"", ""'class',"", ""'cabin',"", ""'advance',"", ""'4',"", ""'5',"", ""'nights',"", ""'cm',"", ""'stay',"", ""'gap',"", ""'house',"", ""'family',"", ""'elephant',"", ""'camp',"", ""'day',"", ""'trip',"", ""'night',"", ""'market',"", ""'cook',"", ""'class',"", ""'fly',"", ""'phuket',"", ""'stay',"", ""'approx',"", ""'5',"", ""'nights',"", ""'centara',"", ""'grand',"", ""'karon',"", ""'6',"", ""'nights',"", ""'ko',"", ""'phi',"", ""'phi',"", ""'phi',"", ""'phi',"", ""'beach',"", ""'resort',"", ""'phuket',"", ""'final',"", ""'week',"", ""'katathani',"", ""'phuket',"", ""'beach',"", ""'resort',"", ""'fly',"", ""'home',"", ""'phuket',"", ""'interest',"", ""'ko',"", ""'lanta',"", ""'fit',"", ""'long',"", ""'travel',"", ""'day',"", ""'fan',"", ""'pack',"", ""'move',"", ""'much',"", ""'kid',"", ""'days',"", ""'maths',"", ""'slightly',"", ""'general',"", ""'idea',"", ""'thoughts',"", ""'tip',"", ""'advice',"", ""'greatly',"", ""'advance']""]",False,True,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

leave dec 22 kyoto. long stay recommended kyoto?
after kyoto straight tokyo stop osaka?
we read packed trains leaving tokyo on/about december 29 thinking end tokyo december 29 fly january 2.
given amount time, recommend stays place. do, definitely want see tokyo fish market. go-karts tokyo? sounds crazy kids love it? bike tour kyoto worth it? family loves sushi ramen amazing sushi ramen recommendations welcome.
thanks advance.","hi everyone. we have flight vouchers that have to be used by march 2022 and so thinking about using them to fly from sfo to tokyo over the christmas holiday when our hs junior son and hs freshman daughter are out of school. understanding that covid could still throw a wrench into things, we thought that we would get our travel bug by doing some research/planning.
we would leave sfo on sat. dec 18 and arrive narita afternoon dec 19. spend one night in tokyo and then take the first train we can down to hiroshima. spend dec 20/21 there to see hiroshima and miyajima.
leave dec 22 am for kyoto. how long of a stay is recommended in kyoto?
after kyoto should we go straight to tokyo or do we also stop in osaka?
we have read about the packed trains leaving tokyo on/about december 29 and so we were thinking that we would end up back in tokyo before december 29 and then fly out from there on january 2.
given that amount of time, what do you all recommend for stays at each place. as for things to do, we definitely want to see the tokyo fish market. what about the go-karts in tokyo? sounds crazy but the kids would probably love it? is a bike tour in kyoto worth it? the family loves sushi and ramen and so amazing sushi and ramen recommendations are welcome.

in sanur there are not many beachfront resorts with kids clubs / facilities. hyatt will still offer the great location and service and large grounds to explore.
prama sanur beach hotel has a huge family pool area with a good water play area for younger children and a kids club. this is not 5 star but offers a huge beach frontage, good facilities and a variety of rooms to suit all budgets. you can see photos of their kids area on facebook and also on trip advisor

other resorts that my interest you are maya sanur resort and fairmon, puri santrian t or merure, these are all beach front options.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g297700-i9509-k13491108-Best_hotel_in_Sanur-Sanur_Denpasar_Bali.html,Best hotel in Sanur,Snookystraveltips,AU,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Snookystraveltips?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,100,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,100,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,100,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,100,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,100,0,100,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,60000,"[""['stay',"", ""'hyatts',"", ""'bali',"", ""'time',"", ""'hyatt',"", ""'sanur',"", ""'waterslide',"", ""'grand',"", ""'hyatt',"", ""'nusa',"", ""'dua',"", ""'hyatt',"", ""'regency',"", ""'huge',"", ""'refurbishment',"", ""'open',"", ""'new',"", ""'kid',"", ""'club',"", ""'contact',"", ""'detail',"", ""'travel',"", ""'restrictions',"", ""'longer',"", ""'place',"", ""'sanur',"", ""'many',"", ""'beachfront',"", ""'resort',"", ""'kid',"", ""'club',"", ""'facilities',"", ""'hyatt',"", ""'location',"", ""'service',"", ""'large',"", ""'ground',"", ""'explore',"", ""'prama',"", ""'sanur',"", ""'beach',"", ""'hotel',"", ""'huge',"", ""'family',"", ""'pool',"", ""'area',"", ""'good',"", ""'water',"", ""'play',"", ""'area',"", ""'younger',"", ""'children',"", ""'kid',"", ""'club',"", ""'5',"", ""'star',"", ""'huge',"", ""'beach',"", ""'frontage',"", ""'good',"", ""'facilities',"", ""'variety',"", ""'room',"", ""'suit',"", ""'budget',"", ""'see',"", ""'photos',"", ""'kid',"", ""'area',"", ""'facebook',"", ""'trip',"", ""'advisor',"", ""'resort',"", ""'interest',"", ""'maya',"", ""'sanur',"", ""'resort',"", ""'fairmon',"", ""'puri',"", ""'santrian',"", ""'merure',"", ""'beach',"", ""'front',"", ""'options']""]",False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

why are the roads and public transport busier than during the first lockdown?
well, lots of businesses, like the one i work for, won't allow people to work from home like last time.
and lots of businesses that were completely closed and who furloughed staff during the first lockdown are now open for business!
but if you are working from home, and only leaving your house for essential food shopping and exercise, then you probably wouldn't notice.
my next door neighbours have sent their daughter back to school because mummy and daddy are both ""key workers"". mummy isn't even working, and daddy has been working from home since last march and certainly isn't even a key worker; so god knows what lies they have told the school!

i'm thinking atlantis good choice family oriented? less particular hotel?
they route singapore stopping dubai days meet us, rest time spend pick resort suited honeymoon.
also planning major sightseeing anything them, possibly dubai mall dessert safari, stroll marina evening mainly spending time together hotel pool/beach worries me.
they obviously fine usual swimsuits holidays place lot instagram models come pose tiny bikinis them,
thank","hi guys we are planning our honeymoon to the maldives and on the way back stopping in dubai to meet up with our parents who are quite reserved, i note dubai in general is very relaxed in terms of topless sunbathing, thong bikinis etc
i'm thinking would atlantis be a good choice as it is very family oriented? so maybe there would be less of this at this particular hotel?
they will be on route to singapore so will only be stopping in dubai for 3 days to meet us, the rest of the time we spend there we will pick another resort that will be more suited to a honeymoon.
also we aren't planning any major sightseeing or anything for while we are there with them, possibly just dubai mall and a dessert safari, probably a stroll around the marina one evening but we will mainly just be spending time together at the hotel pool/beach so this is what worries me.
they are obviously fine with the usual swimsuits on holidays but just if it is a place where a lot of instagram models come to pose in their tiny bikinis it may not be for them,

a young local working girl was sitting with her older foreign holiday boyfriend. a foreign tourist in a bikini walked by. i heard the young lady remark 'she is not shy' in relation to foreign tourist. i thought for a local that her understanding of english and the use of sarcasm was pretty good. wearing swimwear not on or near the beach or in shopping centres (which i have seen) is perhaps seen as a foreigner thing.

i would like to ask if anyone has done the journey from singapore to tioman and back and if so, do you have any helpful tips.
thanks in advance

thinking of flying from london to bangkok and spending a couple of days there, then heading to a beach for six nights or so - maybe somewhere like hua hin, which looks nice. we don't want to get an internal flight, so somewhere not too far from bangkok with some nice places to visit, good food scene and nice hotels would be perfect.
any suggestions welcome - we've really only just started thinking about it. obviously, all of this would be covid permitting (fingers crossed)...

# later drive down and either take a break at rishikesh or drive straight to mussoorie, depending on your comfort
however all said and done, why would you want to do mussoorie, after getting an overdose and the best of it during your 10 hours road trip and subsequent stay at auli. it would only be repetitive, and tiring.
i can suggest you rather opting for rajaji national park, closer to rishikesh to explore more and have a diverse experience.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g1052528-i15274-k13461731-Planning_a_trip_to_Uttarakhand_for_8_days-Joshimath_Auli_Chamoli_District_Uttarakhand.html,Planning a trip to Uttarakhand for 8 days,Travstore Himalayas,"Nainital, India",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travstorehimalayas?tab=forum,0,0,100,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,100,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,100,0,100.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,40000,"[""['route',"", ""'plan',"", ""'arrive',"", ""'dehradun',"", ""'stop',"", ""'rishikesh',"", ""'relax',"", ""'day',"", ""'early',"", ""'morning',"", ""'head',"", ""'auli',"", ""'10',"", ""'hrs',"", ""'reach',"", ""'auli',"", ""'reach',"", ""'3',"", ""'comfortably',"", ""'time',"", ""'cable',"", ""'car',"", ""'wish',"", ""'reach',"", ""'auli',"", ""'top',"", ""'stay',"", ""'joshimath',"", ""'drive',"", ""'break',"", ""'rishikesh',"", ""'drive',"", ""'straight',"", ""'mussoorie',"", ""'comfort',"", ""'mussoorie',"", ""'overdose',"", ""'10',"", ""'hours',"", ""'road',"", ""'trip',"", ""'subsequent',"", ""'stay',"", ""'auli',"", ""'repetitive',"", ""'tire',"", ""'opt',"", ""'rajaji',"", ""'national',"", ""'park',"", ""'closer',"", ""'rishikesh',"", ""'explore',"", ""'diverse',"", ""'experience']""]",False,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

we woke up early at around 4:15 am and arindham drove us to the kaziranga national park. he went into the park office and at around 5:10 am, a guy called out our name. it was already bright and there were a lot of tourists. we followed that guy into the park after paying rs 100 camera fees. we went for an elephant safari (rs. 1250 pp). we had to board the elephant from the ramp. the first minute was nervous as the elephant was moving but then we got used to the movement. we spotted rhinos, wild boars, elephants and deer like the previous day. we were able to go very close to a rhino. the ride ended in and hour. arindham drove us back to our hotel and we were served omlette as breakfast.
we went to sleep, woke up at 9:30 and freshend up and left for the airport at 10:30 am. arindham called up someone to prepare for us traditional assamese bamboo lunch. we reached that place at 11:45 am. they made traditional assamese food on skewers and the rice was made in bamboos. the bamboo rice had a flavour of bamboo in it. the food was not really tasty but was very instagrammable. lots of chutneys were served to us while we were seated in bamboo sheds.
at around 12:30, we set off for the airport. the roads gave way to an express highway where we were able to drive at 80 kpmh consistently. the traffic started increasing steadily as we got closer to guwahati and so did the indiscipline of other drivers. we stopped at a place to have curd. the sour and sweet curd were simply delicious.
at around 5:30 pm, we bid goodbye to arindham and went into the airport. we had to get our check-in bags scanned ourselves, but the departure section seemed decent unlike the arrival section. there was even a drinking water station both before and after security. we were hardly 30 passengers in our flight so we boarded and took off around 15 mins before time.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g297589-i12212-k13514032-Trip_Report_Arunachal_Pradesh_and_Kaziranga_9D8N_Mar21-Arunachal_Pradesh.html,Trip Report - Arunachal Pradesh and Kaziranga - 9D8N - Mar21,Savio D,0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SavioD156?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,50,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,200,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,50,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,50,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,200,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,47500,"[""['day',"", ""'9',"", ""'wake',"", ""'early',"", ""'415',"", ""'arindham',"", ""'drive',"", ""'kaziranga',"", ""'national',"", ""'park',"", ""'park',"", ""'office',"", ""'510',"", ""'guy',"", ""'call',"", ""'name',"", ""'bright',"", ""'lot',"", ""'tourists',"", ""'guy',"", ""'park',"", ""'pay',"", ""'rs',"", ""'100',"", ""'camera',"", ""'fee',"", ""'elephant',"", ""'safari',"", ""'rs',"", ""'1250',"", ""'pp',"", ""'board',"", ""'elephant',"", ""'ramp',"", ""'minute',"", ""'nervous',"", ""'elephant',"", ""'move',"", ""'movement',"", ""'spot',"", ""'rhinos',"", ""'wild',"", ""'boars',"", ""'elephants',"", ""'deer',"", ""'previous',"", ""'day',"", ""'able',"", ""'close',"", ""'rhino',"", ""'ride',"", ""'end',"", ""'hour',"", ""'arindham',"", ""'drive',"", ""'hotel',"", ""'serve',"", ""'omlette',"", ""'breakfast',"", ""'sleep',"", ""'wake',"", ""'930',"", ""'freshend',"", ""'airport',"", ""'1030',"", ""'arindham',"", ""'call',"", ""'prepare',"", ""'traditional',"", ""'assamese',"", ""'bamboo',"", ""'lunch',"", ""'reach',"", ""'place',"", ""'1145',"", ""'traditional',"", ""'assamese',"", ""'food',"", ""'skewer',"", ""'rice',"", ""'bamboos',"", ""'bamboo',"", ""'rice',"", ""'flavour',"", ""'bamboo',"", ""'food',"", ""'tasty',"", ""'instagrammable',"", ""'lot',"", ""'chutneys',"", ""'serve',"", ""'seat',"", ""'bamboo',"", ""'shed',"", ""'1230',"", ""'set',"", ""'airport',"", ""'roads',"", ""'way',"", ""'express',"", ""'highway',"", ""'able',"", ""'drive',"", ""'80',"", ""'kpmh',"", ""'consistently',"", ""'traffic',"", ""'start',"", ""'increase',"", ""'steadily',"", ""'closer',"", ""'guwahati',"", ""'indiscipline',"", ""'drivers',"", ""'stop',"", ""'place',"", ""'curd',"", ""'sour',"", ""'sweet',"", ""'curd',"", ""'simply',"", ""'delicious',"", ""'530',"", ""'bid',"", ""'goodbye',"", ""'arindham',"", ""'airport',"", ""'bag',"", ""'scan',"", ""'departure',"", ""'section',"", ""'decent',"", ""'unlike',"", ""'arrival',"", ""'section',"", ""'drink',"", ""'water',"", ""'station',"", ""'security',"", ""'hardly',"", ""'30',"", ""'passengers',"", ""'flight',"", ""'board',"", ""'15',"", ""'mins',"", ""'time']""]",False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

but since the special tourist visa requires that you provided confirmation of pre-paid accommodation for the duration of your stay, how do you propose to hop from hostel to hostel? plus of course there is the police clearance, long term health insurance on top of covid coverage, doctors clearance, etc. doesn't sound like the avenue of a ""backpacker"" type traveler.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g293915-i3686-k13482570-Thailand_2021-Thailand.html,Thailand 2021,MrCycling 🚵‍♂️,US,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrCycling?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,50,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,200,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,200,0,0,200,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,62500,"[""['michael',"", ""'number',"", ""'backpacker',"", ""'type',"", ""'stick',"", ""'thailand',"", ""'chiang',"", ""'mai',"", ""'hostels',"", ""'open',"", ""'quarantine',"", ""'requirements',"", ""'dissuade',"", ""'new',"", ""'arrive',"", ""'young',"", ""'travelers',"", ""'special',"", ""'tourist',"", ""'visa',"", ""'require',"", ""'provide',"", ""'confirmation',"", ""'pre',"", ""'pay',"", ""'accommodation',"", ""'duration',"", ""'stay',"", ""'propose',"", ""'hop',"", ""'hostel',"", ""'hostel',"", ""'plus',"", ""'course',"", ""'police',"", ""'clearance',"", ""'long',"", ""'term',"", ""'health',"", ""'insurance',"", ""'top',"", ""'covid',"", ""'coverage',"", ""'doctor',"", ""'clearance',"", ""'sound',"", ""'avenue',"", ""'backpacker',"", ""'type',"", ""'traveler']""]",False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

yes ! you will need another holiday to recover from this exhausting trip / itinerary !
for a two week holiday (with kids !) i would pick a maximum of two (or maybe three locations) and spend some time relaxing (chilling !) in each.
and yes, consider flying internally, rather than taking train which will be far less exhausting.
good luck with your continued travel planning !

bkk 4/5 nights
khao sok nights
beach 6/7 nights - tbc
bkk 4/5 nights day trip ayutthaya. stay place bkk - fairly upmarket - longer acclimatised trekking kanchanaburi again. perhaps bkk last. tbc. idea time relax look forward moment bkk first.
overnight train surat thani/trang. wanted train couple reasons 1) environmental reasons 2) adventurous i'd kids experience it. far faff flying part fun.(it's frustrating flights cheaper two flights go.)
now i've thinking stay beach. i'd stay couple different places (i know, know!! hear out) beach bungalow type place lesser known completely remote island ko ngai, ko phayam ko phra thong (but logistically trying work easier. train goes trang well islands easier nearer phuket, whereas last two islands pain surat thani easier phuket home). last 2/3 nights luxury place quiet phuket access kids club, yoga, facilities, phuket old town culture flying home.
definitely want elephant hills. son madly love elephants venture sits well me. love initiatives true responsible tourism. two days definitely relax enjoy natural surroundings.
the 50m stopover qatar. stopping doha. happens book flight miss connection fault own? sell tickets that? i've found couple others 2hour stopover room breathe.
thanks sticking me. true escapism right now. working. instead i'm plotting intricate details trip happening years. god miss seeing world.","ok thanks everyone. i'm now thinking of cutting out kanchanaburi and spending two nights in khao sok instead. i definitely want a balance between city/beach/nature so i think we'd get that without kanchanaburi. good to rein me in. so trip more like this:-
bkk 4/5 nights
khao sok 2 nights
beach 6/7 nights - where tbc
bkk 4/5 nights with day trip to ayutthaya. if we stay in one place in bkk - fairly upmarket - and for longer i think that will be better to get acclimatised than trekking up to kanchanaburi then back again. but perhaps we will do bkk last. still tbc. i like the idea of having time to relax to look forward to so at the moment i think bkk first.
overnight train to surat thani/trang. i actually really wanted to do the train for a couple of reasons 1) environmental reasons 2) more adventurous and i'd like my kids to experience it. i know it's far more faff than flying but for me it's part of the fun.(it's also frustrating flights over there are cheaper if you do two flights but there you go.)
now i've been thinking more about where to stay for beach. i'd like to stay in a couple of different places (i know, i know!! but hear me out) beach bungalow type place on a lesser known but not completely remote island like ko ngai, ko phayam or ko phra thong (but logistically trying to work out which would be easier. the train goes to trang as well so the further down islands may actually be easier than those nearer phuket, but then you have to get back up again whereas the last two islands are more of a pain to get to from surat thani but then easier to get to phuket and home). and then last 2/3 nights in a luxury place in quiet phuket with access to kids club, yoga, facilities, phuket old town culture etc before flying home.
definitely want to go to elephant hills. my son is madly in love with elephants and the venture really sits well with me. i love initiatives that are true responsible tourism. two days better here definitely so we can relax and enjoy the natural surroundings.
the 50m stopover was with qatar. think it was stopping in doha. i mean what happens if you book a flight like that and miss the connection through no fault of your own? why do they sell tickets like that? i've found a couple of others with a 2hour stopover so more room to breathe.
thanks for sticking with me. this is true escapism right now. i should be working. instead i'm plotting the intricate details of a trip that may not be happening for years. god i miss seeing the world.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g293915-i3686-k13454131-Thailand_daydreaming_help_with_itinerary_with_young_kids-Thailand.html,Thailand daydreaming - help with itinerary with young kids,katerinaemalina,US,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/katerinaemalima?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,100,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,100,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,100,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,100,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,100,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,100,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,100,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,70000,"[""['cut',"", ""'kanchanaburi',"", ""'spend',"", ""'two',"", ""'nights',"", ""'khao',"", ""'sok',"", ""'instead',"", ""'balance',"", ""'city',"", ""'beach',"", ""'nature',"", ""'wed',"", ""'kanchanaburi',"", ""'good',"", ""'rein',"", ""'trip',"", ""'bkk',"", ""'4',"", ""'5',"", ""'nights',"", ""'khao',"", ""'sok',"", ""'2',"", ""'nights',"", ""'beach',"", ""'6',"", ""'7',"", ""'nights',"", ""'tbc',"", ""'bkk',"", ""'4',"", ""'5',"", ""'nights',"", ""'day',"", ""'trip',"", ""'ayutthaya',"", ""'stay',"", ""'one',"", ""'place',"", ""'bkk',"", ""'fairly',"", ""'upmarket',"", ""'longer',"", ""'acclimatise',"", ""'trek',"", ""'kanchanaburi',"", ""'bkk',"", ""'tbc',"", ""'idea',"", ""'time',"", ""'relax',"", ""'moment',"", ""'bkk',"", ""'overnight',"", ""'train',"", ""'surat',"", ""'thani',"", ""'trang',"", ""'train',"", ""'couple',"", ""'reason',"", ""'1',"", ""'environmental',"", ""'reason',"", ""'2',"", ""'adventurous',"", ""'kid',"", ""'experience',"", ""'far',"", ""'faff',"", ""'fly',"", ""'part',"", ""'funits',"", ""'frustrate',"", ""'flight',"", ""'cheaper',"", ""'two',"", ""'flight',"", ""'stay',"", ""'beach',"", ""'stay',"", ""'couple',"", ""'different',"", ""'place',"", ""'hear',"", ""'beach',"", ""'bungalow',"", ""'type',"", ""'place',"", ""'lesser',"", ""'completely',"", ""'remote',"", ""'island',"", ""'ko',"", ""'ngai',"", ""'ko',"", ""'phayam',"", ""'ko',"", ""'phra',"", ""'thong',"", ""'logistically',"", ""'try',"", ""'work',"", ""'easier',"", ""'train',"", ""'trang',"", ""'islands',"", ""'may',"", ""'easier',"", ""'nearer',"", ""'phuket',"", ""'whereas',"", ""'two',"", ""'islands',"", ""'pain',"", ""'surat',"", ""'thani',"", ""'easier',"", ""'phuket',"", ""'home',"", ""'2',"", ""'3',"", ""'nights',"", ""'luxury',"", ""'place',"", ""'quiet',"", ""'phuket',"", ""'access',"", ""'kid',"", ""'club',"", ""'yoga',"", ""'facilities',"", ""'phuket',"", ""'old',"", ""'town',"", ""'culture',"", ""'fly',"", ""'home',"", ""'elephant',"", ""'hill',"", ""'son',"", ""'madly',"", ""'elephants',"", ""'venture',"", ""'sit',"", ""'initiatives',"", ""'true',"", ""'responsible',"", ""'tourism',"", ""'two',"", ""'days',"", ""'relax',"", ""'natural',"", ""'surround',"", ""'50m',"", ""'stopover',"", ""'qatar',"", ""'stop',"", ""'doha',"", ""'happen',"", ""'book',"", ""'flight',"", ""'miss',"", ""'connection',"", ""'fault',"", ""'sell',"", ""'ticket',"", ""'couple',"", ""'others',"", ""'2hour',"", ""'stopover',"", ""'room',"", ""'breathe',"", ""'stick',"", ""'true',"", ""'escapism',"", ""'right',"", ""'work',"", ""'instead',"", ""'plot',"", ""'intricate',"", ""'detail',"", ""'trip',"", ""'may',"", ""'happen',"", ""'god',"", ""'miss',"", ""'see',"", ""'world']""]",False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

previously stayed nights away uk couple months time","#16. second time i went i did three nights koh sok and it worked fine.
i stayed in our jungle camp for 3 nights. i drove from krabi town and arrived about noon. first day stayed in the resort and eat in the village in the evening a short walk away. second day i followed some trails around the national park and had lunch in the village and did some kayaking and a night safari arranged by ojc and et in their restaurant. next day i did a day tour again arranged by ojc to the lake which was excellent , with lunch on a raft house, included and a short trek to a waterfall. some people just stayed on the raft house and didn't do the trek. after seeing the raft house accommodation i wouldn't think it worth staying a night. they are run by the national park and are basic with shared shower and toilet facilities. food is basic and think wooden bungalow mattress on floor. i would not stay over night just to sleep there as it gets dark early evening and you would just be leaving again in the morning. if there were any luxury raft houses i might reconsider!
i really enjoyed the day trip and was nice to get back to the facilities at ojc.
i left about midday the next day and drove back to krabi. i found three nights to be fine especially with self driving.

classic journeys, in ca, used to do mostly ""culture and walking"" but have expanded into other areas, including multisport, family, etc. though they do a family trip to alaska's kenai peninsula, i see nothing for scotland, though they do family trips to several other places in europe.
also, classic journeys, and other companies, will arrange private tours for groups, so that is another option if you're willing to pay for it.

1. regardless of whether you are vaccinated or not, everyone must have a pcr test upon arrival in the airport?

3. if we do pcr test prior to arrival will this stop the need for the 17 year old to self isolate upon arrival?

admittedly 200 pounds is a lot for a taxi generally, but it was extremely convenient and cost efficient for a group of travelers. and like i said the whole thing only took 2.5 hours from car rental to car rental. so no waisted time or frustration with luggage. well worth the very reasonable price.
our kids were 5 and 8 years = not helpful with luggage and needed to be 'kept track of' as well. so it was nice to avoid the confusion of a train terminal and hauling luggage. i'm not saying that eurostar cannot be a good option, but if you are not going to cities where it departs, have a lot of luggage, or are a group traveling together, then the taxi is worth considering.
and honestly, the difference between 500 euros and 500 usd (for eurostar) when planning a 3 week trip around europe is not that important. it was over 2 years ago when i was planning the trip, but my notes for eurostar say about 500. maybe that included extra costs for a taxi after dropping off the car or the extra day of rental car cost; whatever it was, eurostar was not cheap or convenient for us.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g186313-i1627-k13485088-Cross_by_ferry_Eurostar_rental_car_Channel_Tunnel_TAXI-Dover_Kent_England.html,"Cross by ferry, Eurostar, rental car, Channel Tunnel?

in central kerala: fort cochin - first and foremost - is a calm spot with plenty of visitor attractions at hand. there are also beaches in this part of the state - cherai and marari for example.
southern kerala: a couple of beach destinations - one at kovalam the other at varkala. also, the joy of kerala is a couple of nights on a houseboat from alleppey.
the western ghats - a mountain range - offer the alternative to coastal life - this region has plenty of national parks, wildlife sanctuaries, trekking and spice, coffee and tea plantations.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g297604-i6045-k13485899-Which_area_to_visit-Goa.html,Which area to visit,DrRudi,AU,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DrRudi?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,100,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,100,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,100,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,100,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,100,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,100,0,0,100,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,70000,"[""['recommendations',"", ""'areas',"", ""'stay',"", ""'kerala',"", ""'sound',"", ""'kerala',"", ""'place',"", ""'worth',"", ""'stay',"", ""'long',"", ""'stay',"", ""'couple',"", ""'northern',"", ""'kerala',"", ""'string',"", ""'coastal',"", ""'villages',"", ""'beach',"", ""'less',"", ""'visit',"", ""'southern',"", ""'kerala',"", ""'kannur',"", ""'good',"", ""'central',"", ""'kerala',"", ""'fort',"", ""'cochin',"", ""'foremost',"", ""'calm',"", ""'spot',"", ""'plenty',"", ""'visitor',"", ""'attractions',"", ""'hand',"", ""'beach',"", ""'part',"", ""'state',"", ""'cherai',"", ""'marari',"", ""'example',"", ""'southern',"", ""'kerala',"", ""'couple',"", ""'beach',"", ""'destinations',"", ""'one',"", ""'kovalam',"", ""'varkala',"", ""'joy',"", ""'kerala',"", ""'couple',"", ""'nights',"", ""'houseboat',"", ""'alleppey',"", ""'western',"", ""'ghats',"", ""'mountain',"", ""'range',"", ""'alternative',"", ""'coastal',"", ""'life',"", ""'region',"", ""'plenty',"", ""'national',"", ""'park',"", ""'wildlife',"", ""'sanctuaries',"", ""'trek',"", ""'spice',"", ""'coffee',"", ""'tea',"", ""'plantations']""]",False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

please share the link to you friends and known once. so that no one should not get into trouble with att and garlic holidays.
be safe on money and your expectations will never be fulfilled through att as they are not taking any responsibility. my deal id is 68345 worst attitude by the staffs (pravin) and managing director. most of the dignified professional staffs were resigned and left the company.
i am sivan from dharmapuri working from nigeria. i booked my family holiday plan through att to andaman till now no refunds not resolved and one year now from the booking.
after making the payment att will not be responsible is the behavior of the team..
they would not be responding on any refunds or any changes of the plans.. so so arrogant behaviour as not fit to be a travel agent at all the level.. just money is only motive and nothing else.. i suggest estt not to burn your hands through att. attitude..

no group of tourists is more important. each tourist is an individual with their own spending, their own time in country, their own number of return visits, etc. a japanese business man popping down for a weekend of golf is just as important as a uk gap year backpacker nickel & dime'ing their way across the country.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g293916-i3687-k13498403-Possible_lifting_of_quarantine-Bangkok.html,Possible lifting of quarantine?,⛱ Life's a Beach ⛱,US,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/UP2UorNot?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,50,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,50,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,200,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,50,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,27500,"[""['214',"", ""'live',"", ""'near',"", ""'travel',"", ""'frequently',"", ""'short',"", ""'trip',"", ""'visitor',"", ""'stats',"", ""'double',"", ""'count',"", ""'visit',"", ""'visit',"", ""'assign',"", ""'count',"", ""'value',"", ""'base',"", ""'distance',"", ""'travel',"", ""'americans',"", ""'canadians',"", ""'double',"", ""'20',"", ""'28',"", ""'hours',"", ""'fly',"", ""'time',"", ""'versus',"", ""'eu',"", ""'uk',"", ""'12ish',"", ""'assign',"", ""'count',"", ""'value',"", ""'base',"", ""'duration',"", ""'visit',"", ""'expats',"", ""'beat',"", ""'hand',"", ""'twice',"", ""'block',"", ""'visit',"", ""'visit',"", ""'period',"", ""'group',"", ""'tourists',"", ""'important',"", ""'tourist',"", ""'individual',"", ""'spend',"", ""'time',"", ""'country',"", ""'number',"", ""'visit',"", ""'japanese',"", ""'business',"", ""'man',"", ""'pop',"", ""'weekend',"", ""'golf',"", ""'important',"", ""'uk',"", ""'gap',"", ""'backpacker',"", ""'nickel',"", ""'dimeing',"", ""'way',"", ""'country']""]",False,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

judy","family holiday in august (current situation allowing) and we'd like to burn a few hilton points for the first week. not bothered about the beach as second week will be spent at the madinat.
while i've stayed at all three hiltons on the beach and wa on the palm i've never been to either the conrad or the habtoor palace. conrad looks to have a nice pool but the habtoor palace looks very luxurious.
we are three adults and a 7 year old and while i accept there won't be a lot going on for the little one in either hotel we do plan to go out and about with her most days.

flew lhr to dxb 14th
emirates check in did not ask reason for travel. quite a few families checking in, either holiday or returning residents. after security, there is a line of border police/regular police spot checking random travellers. they did not pull me over, but i saw some families being questioned. not sure if fpn were being issued.
flight about 1/3 to half full. clearly a lot of people going on holiday but lots of space to distance out.
on arrival, we were thrown into general queues with flights from other destinations to show proof of pcr test. the guy checked mine for a few seconds. on arrival there is also a person holding a board for those to get tested on arrival and they are then taken away, but remarkably allowed to join up with everyone at the baggage carousel a few minutes later with no one accompanying them.
airport was packed.even at 4.40 am. zero distancing in queues and all flights mixed in together going through border control. relatively quick process to get though (less than half an hour). immigration also ask for pcr test so it is checked twice.
hotel asked for nothing re pcr test on arrival. guests not bothering with social distancing or masks around the pool or lobby so giving it a wide berth! hope that helps",0,0,0,0,UAE,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,100,0,100,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,20000,"[""['recent',"", ""'trip',"", ""'experience',"", ""'fly',"", ""'lhr',"", ""'dxb',"", ""'14th',"", ""'emirates',"", ""'reason',"", ""'travel',"", ""'quite',"", ""'families',"", ""'holiday',"", ""'residents',"", ""'security',"", ""'line',"", ""'border',"", ""'police',"", ""'regular',"", ""'police',"", ""'spot',"", ""'random',"", ""'travellers',"", ""'pull',"", ""'saw',"", ""'families',"", ""'question',"", ""'fpn',"", ""'flight',"", ""'1',"", ""'3',"", ""'half',"", ""'full',"", ""'clearly',"", ""'lot',"", ""'people',"", ""'holiday',"", ""'lot',"", ""'space',"", ""'distance',"", ""'arrival',"", ""'throw',"", ""'general',"", ""'queue',"", ""'flight',"", ""'destinations',"", ""'show',"", ""'proof',"", ""'pcr',"", ""'test',"", ""'guy',"", ""'second',"", ""'arrival',"", ""'person',"", ""'hold',"", ""'board',"", ""'test',"", ""'arrival',"", ""'away',"", ""'remarkably',"", ""'allow',"", ""'join',"", ""'baggage',"", ""'carousel',"", ""'minutes',"", ""'one',"", ""'accompany',"", ""'airport',"", ""'packedeven',"", ""'440',"", ""'zero',"", ""'distance',"", ""'queue',"", ""'flight',"", ""'mix',"", ""'together',"", ""'border',"", ""'control',"", ""'relatively',"", ""'quick',"", ""'process',"", ""'less',"", ""'half',"", ""'hour',"", ""'immigration',"", ""'pcr',"", ""'test',"", ""'twice',"", ""'hotel',"", ""'pcr',"", ""'test',"", ""'arrival',"", ""'guests',"", ""'bother',"", ""'social',"", ""'distance',"", ""'mask',"", ""'pool',"", ""'lobby',"", ""'wide',"", ""'berth',"", ""'help']""]",False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

i’m sure that applies to other destinations with people having bookings so i hope the travel committee have thought about that as it will have a big impact and probably legal implications.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g295424-i872-k13517529-UAE_green_list_possibility-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html,UAE green list possibility?,Shaun C,UK,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shaunclark99?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,100,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,100,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,20000,"[""['i’m',"", ""'concern',"", ""'moment',"", ""'dubai',"", ""'onto',"", ""'amber',"", ""'17th',"", ""'may',"", ""'imagine',"", ""'lot',"", ""'brits',"", ""'tend',"", ""'may',"", ""'bank',"", ""'holiday',"", ""'week',"", ""'one',"", ""'package',"", ""'book',"", ""'move',"", ""'may',"", ""'amber',"", ""'operator',"", ""'self',"", ""'isolate',"", ""'regardless',"", ""'therefore',"", ""'travel',"", ""'helpful',"", ""'lot',"", ""'green',"", ""'red',"", ""'i’m',"", ""'destinations',"", ""'people',"", ""'book',"", ""'travel',"", ""'committee',"", ""'big',"", ""'impact',"", ""'legal',"", ""'implications']""]",False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

4 year old (currently) lego mad. booked stay nights lapita, could advantage parks there. staying half board family suite access parks etc.
our stay lapita followed nights jumeirah zabeel saray, staying hb, imperial suite club access. needing taxis sure easy taxis car child seat 18month old (i believe year old need one?)
do good balance terms places stay? year old definitely needs entertaining want anywhere busy struggle sun loungers pool/beach?
i noticed (after booking flights) spring half term holidays kids dubai - likely attractions hotels busy?
we change hotels - problem (though got fantastic deals them). we've booked emirates could change dates necessary too.
tia advice!!","i am planning a family trip for 4 us - 2 kids aged 18 months and 4 at the time of travel. we've never been to dubai before but keeping fingers crossed there may be a semblance of normality when we travel from 24th - 27th march 22'.
4 year old is (currently) lego mad. so we booked to stay 3 nights at lapita, so we could take advantage of the parks there. staying half board in a family suite with access to parks etc.
our stay at lapita will be followed by 4 nights at jumeirah zabeel saray, staying hb, in an imperial suite with club access. i think we are ok with needing to get taxis but not sure how easy it will be to get taxis with a car child seat for the 18month old (i believe the 4 year old doesn't need to be in one?)
do you think this is a good balance in terms of places to stay? the 4 year old definitely needs entertaining but we didn't want anywhere too busy either with having a struggle to get sun loungers by the pool/beach?
i noticed (after booking our flights) that it will be spring half term holidays for the kids in dubai - is it likely that the attractions and hotels will be very busy?
we can change our hotels - no problem (though we got fantastic deals on them). we've booked with emirates and i think we could change our dates if necessary too.

the positive is that we can now go for a bit longer as previously we were restricted to the easter holidays so rather than 3 nights grosvenor were now looking at 3 nights grosvenor and 2 nights atlantis and it’s coming in at pretty much the same price- i didn’t realise how much cheaper it was to go in august!",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g295424-i872-k13462215-Changing_honeymoon_date-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html,Changing honeymoon date,lwragg,UK,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lwragg?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,100,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,100,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,100,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,100,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,100,100,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,60000,"[""['forum',"", ""'useful',"", ""'plan',"", ""'honeymoon',"", ""'dubai',"", ""'maldives',"", ""'easter',"", ""'we’ve',"", ""'decision',"", ""'delay',"", ""'wed',"", ""'2nd',"", ""'april',"", ""'12th',"", ""'aug',"", ""'we’d',"", ""'book',"", ""'flight',"", ""'maldives',"", ""'hotel',"", ""'luxtripper',"", ""'i’m',"", ""'wait',"", ""'price',"", ""'new',"", ""'date',"", ""'i’d',"", ""'book',"", ""'grosvenor',"", ""'house',"", ""'free',"", ""'cancellation',"", ""'basis',"", ""'sort',"", ""'it’s',"", ""'bummer',"", ""'slightly',"", ""'concern',"", ""'august',"", ""'heat',"", ""'humidity',"", ""'we’ve',"", ""'orlando',"", ""'august',"", ""'tell',"", ""'it’s',"", ""'much',"", ""'worse',"", ""'positive',"", ""'longer',"", ""'previously',"", ""'restrict',"", ""'easter',"", ""'holiday',"", ""'3',"", ""'nights',"", ""'grosvenor',"", ""'3',"", ""'nights',"", ""'grosvenor',"", ""'2',"", ""'nights',"", ""'atlantis',"", ""'it’s',"", ""'pretty',"", ""'much',"", ""'price',"", ""'didn’t',"", ""'realise',"", ""'much',"", ""'cheaper',"", ""'august']""]",False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

i have a trip to dubai planned for next week. the trip is for 6 days. this was booked back in december, so as you know, the covid situation - especially from a media perspective - is significantly different than back in december.
i am deciding on whether or not to postpone the trip. obviously there is inherent risk for any travel, but i would love to see some perspective from those who are either in dubai or have visited in the last few weeks or so to help make an informed decision thats best for me and my family.
i appreciate any and all insight.

have you considered buying open jaw air tickets, maybe arriving in scotland and leaving from london? if you did this you could construct a zigzag trip going glasgow, aberystwyth, norwich, heathrow, which, according to a bing map search would, direct, be 729 miles in total. in british terms this is a lot of driving but in three weeks, and as it for a specific purpose rather than random sightseeing, it would be entirely possible. as all of these places have railway stations, you could do the trip by train, with several changes on the way, but a car would give you flexibility and you could take in some interesting sights en route without lengthening your driving overmuch. for instance, close to the direct route from glasgow to aberystwyth there are two wonderful national parks (the lake district and snowdonia) and you could stop over for two or three nights in either or both of these. there’s also the fine city of liverpool of course, and, for a contrast, the roman/medieval cathedral city of chester. standard advice here is not to do lots of one-night-stands but to pace your journey and get to know fewer places well rather than more places superficially.
aberystwyth to norwich is far from being a ‘standard’ tourist trip but you could explore the welsh borders en route – consider the fine old town of ludlow as a stopover. lichfield is a delightful cathedral city, off the well-trodden tourist track, and cambridge wouldn’t be a very big detour. norwich itself is a great small city and one which tends to be unjustly missed by overseas visitors purely because of its geography.
all this is obviously exceptionally covid-dependent and i think you realise that the chances of it being possible safely and legally this season are less than evens. bear in mind too that late july and august are high season touristically and i suspect more british people will tend to be holidaying, if at all, within britain rather than overseas. finally, a website called university rooms offers accommodation actually within university colleges and halls of residence outside term time. worth a look if you haven’t already, although for obvious reasons they won’t be taking bookings just now.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g186216-i15-k13461836-Possible_trip_in_August_late_July-United_Kingdom.html,Possible trip in August/late

all your ideas and advice appreciated!!",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g186234-i637-k13579754-Family_break_to_Cornwall_Advice_Please-Cornwall_England.html,Family break to Cornwall - Advice Please,Mrsnawaz,Peterborough...,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mrsnawaz?tab=forum,0,0,100,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,100,0.0,0,100,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,100,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,100,0,100,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,60000,"[""['book',"", ""'4',"", ""'nights',"", ""'break',"", ""'cornwall',"", ""'august',"", ""'family',"", ""'2',"", ""'adults',"", ""'3',"", ""'kid',"", ""'13',"", ""'11',"", ""'3',"", ""'yrs',"", ""'old',"", ""'book',"", ""'helston',"", ""'premier',"", ""'inn',"", ""'good',"", ""'base',"", ""'one',"", ""'date',"", ""'car',"", ""'relax',"", ""'break',"", ""'sight',"", ""'amaze',"", ""'scenery',"", ""'beach',"", ""'day',"", ""'eat',"", ""'yummy',"", ""'fish',"", ""'chip',"", ""'family',"", ""'friendly',"", ""'afternoon',"", ""'cream',"", ""'tea',"", ""'help',"", ""'build',"", ""'itinerary',"", ""'good',"", ""'3',"", ""'oldi',"", ""'therell',"", ""'prob',"", ""'fair',"", ""'amount',"", ""'walk',"", ""'happy',"", ""'long',"", ""'break',"", ""'pushchair',"", ""'ideas',"", ""'advice']""]",False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

i think we're up for taking a risk re sea sickness, but so interested to know if people have views on which of the ferry crossings is the most beautiful... and whether we are best of having a couple of nights on barra or on skye. we love epic scenery and we are hikers - though a bit limited in what we can do at the moment with babe in arms and small child in toe.
after the ferry crossing we will have a week on harris then a week near torridon back in the main land.

i mention bac ha makes good starting point. easy arrange car driver drive ha giang via hoang su phi. lot sense continue driver dong van, meo vac, bao lac perhaps far cao bang.
it sensible leave hanoi night train wed thurs night, arrive bac ha thurs fri morning. easily nearby cau market sat morning big sunday market bac ha town itself.","my father and i spent 3 weeks in the north in sept 2019, as follows:
- the first two days and last two days in hanoi
- 4 days in bac ha (night train to lao cai, then 2hr bus trip to bac ha)
- 2 days with a car and driver, driving from bac ha to ha giang, staying overnight in hoang su phi
- 10 days riding a motorbike from ha giang to cao bang, via dong van, meo vac, bao lac etc.
- cao bang to hanoi by luxury mini-van (very comfortable 6hr trip)
i have been to bac ha several times and it is one of my favourite places in the country. there are practically no tourists throughout the week, except for a few which come for the large, excellent sunday market. there are many ethnic groups in the surrounding mountains and it is a great area for trekking, or exploring by motor scooter, or with a car and driver.
i mention bac ha as it makes a good starting point. it is easy to arrange a car and driver there to drive to ha giang via hoang su phi. it would then make a lot of sense to continue on with the same driver to dong van, meo vac, bao lac and perhaps as far as cao bang.
it is sensible to leave hanoi by night train on either wed or thurs night, so you then arrive in bac ha on thurs or fri morning. you can easily go to the nearby can cau market on sat morning and the big sunday market in bac ha town itself.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g1544599-i21344-k13460878-Hoang_Su_Phi_in_May-Ha_Giang_Ha_Giang_Province.html,Hoang Su Phi in May,Dale Holmes,AU,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DaleHolmes?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,200,200,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,50,0.0,50,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,200,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,50,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,67500,"[""['father',"", ""'spend',"", ""'3',"", ""'weeks',"", ""'north',"", ""'sept',"", ""'2019',"", ""'two',"", ""'days',"", ""'two',"", ""'days',"", ""'hanoi',"", ""'4',"", ""'days',"", ""'bac',"", ""'ha',"", ""'night',"", ""'train',"", ""'lao',"", ""'cai',"", ""'2hr',"", ""'bus',"", ""'trip',"", ""'bac',"", ""'ha',"", ""'2',"", ""'days',"", ""'car',"", ""'driver',"", ""'drive',"", ""'bac',"", ""'ha',"", ""'ha',"", ""'giang',"", ""'stay',"", ""'overnight',"", ""'hoang',"", ""'su',"", ""'phi',"", ""'10',"", ""'days',"", ""'rid',"", ""'motorbike',"", ""'ha',"", ""'giang',"", ""'cao',"", ""'bang',"", ""'via',"", ""'dong',"", ""'van',"", ""'meo',"", ""'vac',"", ""'bao',"", ""'lac',"", ""'cao',"", ""'bang',"", ""'hanoi',"", ""'luxury',"", ""'mini',"", ""'van',"", ""'comfortable',"", ""'6hr',"", ""'trip',"", ""'bac',"", ""'ha',"", ""'time',"", ""'one',"", ""'favourite',"", ""'place',"", ""'country',"", ""'practically',"", ""'tourists',"", ""'throughout',"", ""'week',"", ""'except',"", ""'large',"", ""'excellent',"", ""'sunday',"", ""'market',"", ""'many',"", ""'ethnic',"", ""'group',"", ""'surround',"", ""'mountains',"", ""'area',"", ""'trek',"", ""'explore',"", ""'motor',"", ""'scooter',"", ""'car',"", ""'driver',"", ""'bac',"", ""'ha',"", ""'good',"", ""'start',"", ""'point',"", ""'easy',"", ""'arrange',"", ""'car',"", ""'driver',"", ""'drive',"", ""'ha',"", ""'giang',"", ""'via',"", ""'hoang',"", ""'su',"", ""'phi',"", ""'lot',"", ""'sense',"", ""'continue',"", ""'driver',"", ""'dong',"", ""'van',"", ""'meo',"", ""'vac',"", ""'bao',"", ""'lac',"", ""'far',"", ""'cao',"", ""'bang',"", ""'sensible',"", ""'hanoi',"", ""'night',"", ""'train',"", ""'wed',"", ""'thurs',"", ""'night',"", ""'arrive',"", ""'bac',"", ""'ha',"", ""'thurs',"", ""'fri',"", ""'morning',"", ""'easily',"", ""'nearby',"", ""'cau',"", ""'market',"", ""'sit',"", ""'morning',"", ""'big',"", ""'sunday',"", ""'market',"", ""'bac',"", ""'ha',"", ""'town']""]",False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

that is quite ambitious coming from matsuyama which is probably 100km away. visiting shiudeyama and goshiki-dai would probably take up a few hours. beware that steering speeds on mountainous roads in both would be less than 50km/h.
for a more relaxed drive, consider staying overnight in tokushima or in awaji and visit parks in latter on the next day.
another option is to return car in takamatsu, take frequent jr trains or express bus to kobe for an overnight (should be much less expensive). pick up a rental car in kobe and visit awaji the next day.
if you're concerned about luggage, consider this efficient and reliable luggage delivery service when travelling in japan.

looking back, i think i was calm as i could be. there was just barely enough time to get to the right car with the crowd in the way. i agree that walking from car to car would be an option during normal time, but i was there around christmas holiday time. there were tons of people, which was why i decided to get reserved seats.
in italy and switizerland, i had made train connections that were tighter than this, such as 5 minutes to make a train three platforms away. the main difference is, they seemed to always use the same platform for each train, so i know days in advance and mapped out the process.

at least for myself, i was originally even stumped by the fact that i had to pass through a set of commuter turnstile before i could even get to another area when the shinkansen turnstile/gates were at tokyo station. and i did not have the commuter pass or tickets. this would pose no issue at all for people who had been through this many time, they probably already know to go to the manned gates on the left or on the rights without looking. believe me, that is not obvious nor intuitive for a foreigner. something that may be hard to the local citizens to understand.
the christmas holiday crowds made the process harder. i did not mind at all. i just want to learn how to make it better.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g294232-i525-k13497149-Shinkansen_platform_information-Japan.html,Shinkansen platform information,edofva,CA,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/edofva?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,50,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,200,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,22500,"[""['tip',"", ""'sammyfd',"", ""'dli',"", ""'hk',"", ""'many',"", ""'others',"", ""'read',"", ""'thread',"", ""'knowledgeable',"", ""'handle',"", ""'shinkansen',"", ""'departure',"", ""'experience',"", ""'least',"", ""'originally',"", ""'stump',"", ""'fact',"", ""'pass',"", ""'set',"", ""'commuter',"", ""'turnstile',"", ""'area',"", ""'shinkansen',"", ""'turnstile',"", ""'gate',"", ""'tokyo',"", ""'station',"", ""'commuter',"", ""'pass',"", ""'ticket',"", ""'pose',"", ""'people',"", ""'many',"", ""'time',"", ""'man',"", ""'gate',"", ""'right',"", ""'obvious',"", ""'intuitive',"", ""'foreigner',"", ""'something',"", ""'may',"", ""'hard',"", ""'local',"", ""'citizens',"", ""'christmas',"", ""'holiday',"", ""'crowd',"", ""'process',"", ""'harder',"", ""'mind',"", ""'learn']""]",False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

many ""investors"" have started to vulture scopping up land and real estate deals..and the balinese i know stil have the resources to hold the line to avoid selling out for extremely low prices.
in the media bali and to a larger extent all of indonesia is often pictured as a poor country with poor resources and begging from help from the outside , a media frenzy if you will, of neo-colonialsm. it's not really as many think...yes we buy or filter our drinking water, but then so do many in my own ""first world"" country. public transport was given a few tries but very few people used it (due to many factors). i could go on and on but don't have the time right now...as i say these kinds of conversations abound within indonesia and i woudl have to write a book to touch on everything!",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g294226-i7220-k13475353-Can_they_handle_Covid_Is_it_worth_it_this_summer-Bali.html,Can they handle Covid?

cheers, andy.","hi,
if you adored the erawan falls you will absolutely adore the huay mae kamin falls which in my opinion are much nicer and far less visited than the former.
the falls consist of seven tiers, you can take a dip in tiers 7, 5, 3, 2 and 1. having said that tier 3 is the the most popular one.
no worries about fish nibbling at your feet, quite simply there aren't any.
a few kms beyond the erawan falls, just off the road which leads to the huay mae kamin falls you will encounter the phra that cave.
the srinagarindra national park, which hosts the hmk falls has a range of accommodation. spend a night or two there, it will make your stay even more special!

before you taint the good name of a company who many people use perhaps put you case forward with fact.
it appears you have made booking via them for a hotel. now you are unable to use that booking that you have paid for . this could be for many reasons, such as can not travel .
sometime ago , i booked and paid for a room in sydney . the t+c was clear i could not cancel and if i did not use it , then i would not get refund. at the last minute i was not able to travel, due to a family issue . i called the hotel and advised then i would not be checking and they could sell the room to another customer .

also this website for public transport planning:

after a boat trip, i would just enjoy balloch country park which gives lovely views of the loch and with lots of room for the children to run around.
the train journey - that is a lot of travelling time.if it's a lovely day then you might be as well only going as far as corrour station, the remotest in the uk.gorgeous area.you can walk down to loch ossian on a good track, have time at the loch in lovely scenery and visit the good bistro for something to eat (or take a picnic.) the scenery on the first portion of the train trip to corrour and fort william, to be, beats what you see on the fw mallaig portion (good though that is too.)

not yet in wales!! was not included in the review this week. we move into our tier 2 tomorrow; that's the easing of many restrictions, but for meeting in private homes it's still our exclusive 'extended households' only. this won't change until earlyjune , at the earliest, after the next 3-weekly review.

personally, as a single person with no close family , without a car, who hasn't been able to properly meet and relax with friends for over a year (outdoors,zoom,phone only) i'm beginning to find this expectation of international travel for summer 2021 really annoying.
like dewy, i feel i'm living in a parallel universe.

not to say that bali is perfectly safe and without risk - things can and do happen, and you have to be as sensible as you would be anywhere else. the main things to watch out for are petty theft, cash machine scams, motorcycle accidents (if you're inexperienced) and dodgy food practices - violent crime seems to be relatively rare. obviously not the ingredients for a juicy news story, but that's often the way with the truth.
you won't have any problem getting away from the young party crowd - others have pointed out great areas to visit that would suit you. a lot of it is touristy but not in a bad way - the range and quality of food and shops is usually great to cater for the tourists.
yes, it's changed over the years, and it is sad to see less of the local stuff and more of the global shops but the balinese culture permeates everything, even in downtown kuta, with incense and offerings outside the shops and temples interspersed throughout.
it's a place that has something to suit everyone's taste, from uber luxury to backpackers and everyone in between - the vast majority of people who visit love it and many come back again and again (and in the case of the members of this forum, again and again and again. well we would if we could).

myself and my fiancé are currently planning our honeymoon to thailand for the very start of january 2022 through our travel agent. we are both in our late 20’s and enjoy nice food, beautiful beaches, outdoor activities and occasional nights out. our itinerary at the moment is looking like this but we are not sure if we are moving about too much or capturing the best beach locations.
- 2 nights in bangkok (including new years night) in the chatrium hotel riverside
- 3 nights in koh samuel in the six senses hotel
- 3 nights in koh tao in the haad tien beach resort (we have done some research on this hotel and have found a lot of bad reviews)
- 5 nights in krabi in the phulay bay ritz carlton
- 2 nights in koh sok national park
- 2 nights in koh lak in the sarojin
- 2 night stop over in dubai on our way home
along with concerns about too much moving around, we are also wondering if anyone would be able to comment on our specific route or hotels? there seems to be a lot of areas or islands to go to so we feel a little bombarded with options and would greatly appreciate some advice.
thanks very much,

where areas would you recommend to stay?
is it easy to get around with big suitcases when island hopping?
i don't want to lose too much time travelling around but equally don't want to spend all our time in 1 place. was thinking of doing 1 week in phuket and another week in krabi and then book day trips from those locations. would that work or am i better off booking accommodation in all the areas that are worth visiting?
i have tried to do lots of research but there just seems to be so many places to visit, i really don't have a clue. we don't do water sports. looking for scenic places and child friendly.
please give me some recommendations!
it's our first visit!
