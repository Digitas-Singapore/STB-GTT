we are looking for somewhere that has nice beaches, and within walking distance from bars and restaurants etc. but not looking for the party vibe, as we would like to go to restaurants and bars in the evening.
we are mainly looking at krabi, cape panwa, phuket and khao lak but opened to other options. but as we have never been before we are unsure what would be suitable for us. our budget for our hotel would be around £2600 for 2 weeks for either bed & breakfast or all inclusive.
we are looking at going to an elephant sanctuary and phi phi island are just a few excursions we would like to do, if you could recommend any hotels would be much appreciated. thank you!",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g293915-i3686-k13513398-Travelling_as_a_Couple-Thailand.html,Travelling as a Couple,Kels,UK,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kels1602?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,50,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,50,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,50,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,200,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,50,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,50,0,50,0,0.0,0.0,50,0,0,0,0,50.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,200,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,60000,"[""['recommendations',"", ""'place',"", ""'stay',"", ""'thailand',"", ""'travel',"", ""'couple',"", ""'travel',"", ""'february',"", ""'time',"", ""'2',"", ""'weeks',"", ""'travel',"", ""'uk',"", ""'book',"", ""'tui',"", ""'beach',"", ""'walk',"", ""'distance',"", ""'bar',"", ""'restaurants',"", ""'party',"", ""'vibe',"", ""'restaurants',"", ""'bar',"", ""'mainly',"", ""'krabi',"", ""'cape',"", ""'panwa',"", ""'phuket',"", ""'khao',"", ""'lak',"", ""'open',"", ""'options',"", ""'unsure',"", ""'suitable',"", ""'budget',"", ""'hotel',"", ""'£2600',"", ""'2',"", ""'weeks',"", ""'bed',"", ""'breakfast',"", ""'inclusive',"", ""'elephant',"", ""'sanctuary',"", ""'phi',"", ""'phi',"", ""'island',"", ""'excursions',"", ""'recommend',"", ""'hotels',"", ""'much']""]",False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

i made a brief stop in kho lak, for lunch and a look around, towards the end of february.
the area i am referencing can be found here:

anyway, kho lak was the first ghost town beach destination i had encountered and it really did make my jaw drop. finding lunch was a challenge but we did prevail as there were one or two beaches (nearly empty) beachside restaurants open.
obviously, no one can predict with any degree of certainty what the situation will be like next year, but if people think these areas are going to come roaring back to life in the next nine months............i'd wager against it.
as i mentioned in the first post, i would strongly suggest that the op take a look at going to phuket as an alternative.
on the other hand, if the op is truly looking for peace and quiet, khao lak will certainly fit the bill :)

good luck trip!","i guess it depends on your taste for the finer things and spending on 'nightlife'. for a backpacker, $5k (~$330/day) would be a boatload of money. eating street food or casual restaurants and a few beers would cost you about $30-40 at most. transportation and visiting the sights maybe $20-100 depending. leaving you a couple hundred per day which you could spend on nightlife but even that would be extravagant. unless you have super expensive tastes and spend like a drunken sailor on the nightlife, your budget should be more than enough.
i can't speak to how well you'd be accepted as a black male, though the thais are generally very accepting of foreigners. i'd heard that there's been (pre-covid) a criminal element from africa that's makes people wary of black people in general but you'll need to dig deeper on this. as a solo traveler in thailand i found it easy to meet other travelers. it may depend on where you stay, though.
in terms of places to visit, don't miss the fantastic thai temples in bangkok. the temple of the emerald buddha/national palace, wat po, wat arun are some of the most popular. a tour of the klongs in a long tail boat is a must see, imho. if you can, try to make a day trip to ayuthaya for the ruined temples. the floating market is great but couple it with a tour of the surrounding canals.
i haven't been to pattaya in decades but my impression is that it's mostly about the nightlife with little else to do. it's not a great beach destination. imo. others may correct me on this. if you're not married to spending 8 days in pattaya consider splitting the time with koh samui or krabi or phuket. much better beach destinations and still nightlife around.
good luck with your trip!",pantip,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g293915-i3686-k13490076-Going_to_thailand_for_2_weeks_is_5K_usd_enough-Thailand.html,Going to thailand for 2 weeks is 5K usd enough?,KhunBill,0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KhunBill?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,50,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,50,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,50,0,0,0,200,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,50,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,50,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,50,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,200,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,50,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,57500,"[""['guess',"", ""'taste',"", ""'finer',"", ""'spend',"", ""'nightlife',"", ""'backpacker',"", ""'5k',"", ""'330',"", ""'day',"", ""'boatload',"", ""'money',"", ""'eat',"", ""'street',"", ""'food',"", ""'casual',"", ""'restaurants',"", ""'beers',"", ""'cost',"", ""'30',"", ""'40',"", ""'transportation',"", ""'visit',"", ""'sight',"", ""'20',"", ""'100',"", ""'couple',"", ""'hundred',"", ""'per',"", ""'day',"", ""'spend',"", ""'nightlife',"", ""'extravagant',"", ""'super',"", ""'expensive',"", ""'taste',"", ""'spend',"", ""'drunken',"", ""'sailor',"", ""'nightlife',"", ""'budget',"", ""'speak',"", ""'youd',"", ""'accept',"", ""'black',"", ""'male',"", ""'thais',"", ""'generally',"", ""'accept',"", ""'foreigners',"", ""'hear',"", ""'pre',"", ""'covid',"", ""'criminal',"", ""'element',"", ""'africa',"", ""'people',"", ""'wary',"", ""'black',"", ""'people',"", ""'general',"", ""'dig',"", ""'deeper',"", ""'solo',"", ""'traveler',"", ""'thailand',"", ""'easy',"", ""'meet',"", ""'travelers',"", ""'may',"", ""'stay',"", ""'term',"", ""'place',"", ""'visit',"", ""'miss',"", ""'fantastic',"", ""'thai',"", ""'temples',"", ""'bangkok',"", ""'temple',"", ""'emerald',"", ""'buddha',"", ""'national',"", ""'palace',"", ""'wat',"", ""'po',"", ""'wat',"", ""'arun',"", ""'popular',"", ""'tour',"", ""'klongs',"", ""'long',"", ""'tail',"", ""'boat',"", ""'must',"", ""'see',"", ""'imho',"", ""'try',"", ""'day',"", ""'trip',"", ""'ayuthaya',"", ""'ruin',"", ""'temples',"", ""'float',"", ""'market',"", ""'couple',"", ""'tour',"", ""'surround',"", ""'canal',"", ""'pattaya',"", ""'decades',"", ""'impression',"", ""'mostly',"", ""'nightlife',"", ""'little',"", ""'beach',"", ""'destination',"", ""'imo',"", ""'others',"", ""'may',"", ""'correct',"", ""'marry',"", ""'spend',"", ""'8',"", ""'days',"", ""'pattaya',"", ""'split',"", ""'time',"", ""'koh',"", ""'samui',"", ""'krabi',"", ""'phuket',"", ""'much',"", ""'beach',"", ""'destinations',"", ""'nightlife',"", ""'good',"", ""'trip']""]",False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

all said, wondering could value something beaten track, right track looking?
thanks advance guys","we have just arrived back in scotland after 6.5 years in australia, and are going to use the last of our qantas points to head to dubai for our 10th wedding anniversary over the first weekend of feb 2022. we will be spending 2 nights, sat - mon. it will be our first ever kid free holiday (the grandparents and nights away were one of the draws to moving home).
we have never visited dubai before and are a bit overwhelmed by everything that is on offer re different locations, club rooms, half board options etc.
i know shaun has mentioned in his many useful posts that the more info we can give when asking for help the better, so here it goes. i just asked the wife what she would want to do and verbatim ""lie by a nice pool, go to a nice spa, eat nice food and drink nice drinks. i dont need to spend too much time exploring the city"". as such, the hotel and its facilities are more important than the location. 5 star luxury would obviously be nice, but within reason- looking at something around the 2000-3000 aed mark for the 2 nights. we do normally enjoy having a few beers during the day on holiday, but i dont know/understand if a club room would be worth it over just ordering beers at the bar/pool.
a few of the hotels on my radar are raffles, versace, anantara or le meridien. ja the resort is offering all inclusive for around an extra 1000 aed, but i dont know if we would drink eat that much and we would like to spend some money in the local economy.
all that being said, i was wondering if we could maybe get better value at something a bit more off the beaten track, or am i on the right track with where i am looking?

personally people trying to blame travelling to dubai for the current state of the uk covid rates is somewhat ridiculous and bizarre.
but, yes the palazzo versace is a great place. you really get that luxury vibe. afternoon tea was great, was in the main lobby area which is much more grand and luxurious than the executive club lounge. but, maybe because business is good right now they are moving it back to the club lounge from tomorrow. the club lounge drinks and food is from 6-8pm which is good. they had a decent f&b selection on offer. in fact the fox was gorgeous. an indian selection.

what hotel would everyone recommend (maybe one that has a nightclub or great bar in it ?), what nightclubs/dance places would you recommend in that area (or are we off base and we should stay in the marina or something instead?) and ideas on how we can fit everything in to 2 days and 3 nights. lol. we've looked through the forums, read the suggested 3 day trip and talked to people but it can be a bit overwhelming so are hoping for suggestions to narrow it down a bit for us. thanks for any insight and the help!",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g295424-i872-k13592696-Hotel_brunch_and_Nightlife-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html,"Hotel, brunch and Nightlife",luckyLP13,"Redding, California",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/luckyLP13?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,50,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,200.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,50,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,50,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,50,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,50,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,32500,"[""['daughter',"", ""'land',"", ""'dubai',"", ""'july',"", ""'7th',"", ""'740pm',"", ""'maldives',"", ""'july',"", ""'10th',"", ""'910am',"", ""'much',"", ""'time',"", ""'desert',"", ""'safari',"", ""'others',"", ""'see',"", ""'fountains',"", ""'burj',"", ""'khalifa',"", ""'high',"", ""'tea',"", ""'brunch',"", ""'hit',"", ""'nightclubs',"", ""'dance',"", ""'stay',"", ""'downtown',"", ""'area',"", ""'close',"", ""'metro',"", ""'mostly',"", ""'water',"", ""'taxis',"", ""'hotel',"", ""'recommend',"", ""'one',"", ""'nightclub',"", ""'bar',"", ""'nightclubs',"", ""'dance',"", ""'place',"", ""'recommend',"", ""'area',"", ""'base',"", ""'stay',"", ""'marina',"", ""'something',"", ""'instead',"", ""'ideas',"", ""'fit',"", ""'2',"", ""'days',"", ""'3',"", ""'nights',"", ""'forums',"", ""'read',"", ""'3',"", ""'day',"", ""'trip',"", ""'talk',"", ""'people',"", ""'overwhelm',"", ""'hop',"", ""'suggestions',"", ""'narrow',"", ""'insight',"", ""'help']""]",False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

sorry i'm bnb wyndham, next hotel looking splurge days. wyndham seemed good deal time, see marina. looked suggestions going leave now. hotel free transfers riva, wrong could free access. worth hassle pool onsite wait beach jbr, saves sun loungers etc. looks nice website . weve august dont worry used oven thanks much detailed advice, important nice look sec. thanks mentioning barasti sounds brilliant thanks thinking son.
so true excellent restaurants dubai, cancelled anantara morning booked caesers, eyed versace good teens caesers. wanted ghh/lrm decided done reservations now. knows birthday next year try location food  funny lack visitors thought bookings up, usual capacity guess.
yes looked habtoor initally good deal found slightly money. wyndham getting free taxi airport wild wadi tickets too, reviews bad looked ok. worked cheapest ww tickets taxi costs wasnt bad deal.
w palm mix initally decided places adults son thought pretentious eat akira back. looked five discounted price?
anantara lovely quiet onsite days, never considered waldorf eat leaving now. much taking time helpful answer much appreciated.","hi lovedogs
i have dyspraxia and my mind can get jumbled and my posts may seem very erratic 
sorry no i'm bnb with wyndham, so the next hotel were looking to splurge for a few days. wyndham seemed like a good deal at the time, but can see it's a bit further out from the marina. we looked at other suggestions but just going to leave it as it is now. the hotel has free transfers to the riva, but may be wrong could just be free access. if it's not worth the hassle we won't use it as we have a pool onsite and can wait for the beach or go to jbr, just saves on sun loungers etc. hopefully it's the same one looks nice on the website anyway . weve been in august before dont worry were used to being in an oven but thanks so much for the detailed advice, wasn't that important just nice to have so will look when i get a sec. thanks for mentioning barasti sounds brilliant thanks for thinking of my son.
so true about the excellent restaurants in dubai, i cancelled anantara this morning and booked caesers, eyed up versace which was good but think there is more for teens at caesers. wanted to do ghh/lrm but decided that we are done with reservations now. who knows might be back for my birthday next year so will try that out great location and food  funny about the lack of visitors thought bookings were up, probably not usual capacity i guess.
yes i looked at the habtoor initally was a good deal but found better for slightly more money. with wyndham were getting a free taxi from the airport and wild wadi tickets too, reviews didn't seem that bad and looked ok. worked out the cheapest we can get ww tickets and taxi costs and wasnt too bad of a deal.
w at the palm was in the mix initally but we decided as a few places are adults only and my son thought it was a bit pretentious we will just eat at akira back. yeah we looked at five too don't know why it was discounted maybe price?
anantara did seem lovely but maybe too quiet if were onsite for a few days, yeah never considered waldorf only to eat but leaving it now. thank you so much for taking your time to give such a helpful answer much appreciated.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g295424-i872-k13644812-We_thought_we_narrowed_down_our_hotel_and_how_does_everyone-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html,We thought we narrowed down our hotel and how does everyone,CHOCABLOC,UK,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CHOCABLOC?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,50,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,200,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,50,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,50,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,50,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,50.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,200,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,52500,"[""['lovedogs',"", ""'dyspraxia',"", ""'mind',"", ""'jumble',"", ""'post',"", ""'may',"", ""'erratic',"", ""'sorry',"", ""'bnb',"", ""'wyndham',"", ""'hotel',"", ""'splurge',"", ""'days',"", ""'wyndham',"", ""'good',"", ""'deal',"", ""'time',"", ""'see',"", ""'marina',"", ""'suggestions',"", ""'hotel',"", ""'free',"", ""'transfer',"", ""'riva',"", ""'may',"", ""'wrong',"", ""'free',"", ""'access',"", ""'worth',"", ""'hassle',"", ""'pool',"", ""'onsite',"", ""'wait',"", ""'beach',"", ""'jbr',"", ""'save',"", ""'sun',"", ""'loungers',"", ""'one',"", ""'website',"", ""'august',"", ""'worry',"", ""'oven',"", ""'much',"", ""'detail',"", ""'advice',"", ""'wasnt',"", ""'important',"", ""'sec',"", ""'barasti',"", ""'sound',"", ""'brilliant',"", ""'son',"", ""'true',"", ""'excellent',"", ""'restaurants',"", ""'dubai',"", ""'cancel',"", ""'anantara',"", ""'morning',"", ""'book',"", ""'caesers',"", ""'eye',"", ""'versace',"", ""'good',"", ""'teens',"", ""'caesers',"", ""'ghh',"", ""'lrm',"", ""'reservations',"", ""'birthday',"", ""'try',"", ""'location',"", ""'food',"", ""'funny',"", ""'lack',"", ""'visitors',"", ""'book',"", ""'usual',"", ""'capacity',"", ""'guess',"", ""'habtoor',"", ""'initally',"", ""'good',"", ""'deal',"", ""'slightly',"", ""'money',"", ""'wyndham',"", ""'free',"", ""'taxi',"", ""'airport',"", ""'wild',"", ""'wadi',"", ""'ticket',"", ""'bad',"", ""'work',"", ""'cheapest',"", ""'ww',"", ""'ticket',"", ""'taxi',"", ""'cost',"", ""'wasnt',"", ""'bad',"", ""'deal',"", ""'w',"", ""'palm',"", ""'mix',"", ""'initally',"", ""'place',"", ""'adults',"", ""'son',"", ""'pretentious',"", ""'eat',"", ""'akira',"", ""'five',"", ""'discount',"", ""'price',"", ""'anantara',"", ""'quiet',"", ""'onsite',"", ""'days',"", ""'waldorf',"", ""'eat',"", ""'much',"", ""'time',"", ""'helpful',"", ""'much']""]",False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

sorry to say...i also believe it is not possible for foreigners to enter japan this june 2021. but it is not clear on your note. if you are holding a japanese passport or residency pass, then certainly you may enter. but the 14 days quarantine isolation should be part of your plan as global has already mentioned.
again, it is not clear in your note. are you referring to a budget of $110 in us dollar? the currency is in yen. but if in us dollar, that amount will be appropriate for food/restaurant budget for two persons per day. it will not be enough for accommodations and/or transportation. of the three elements, transportation is the most expensive element in japan personally speaking.
do some more research before booking your flight tickets in early june as planned.

my fiancé and i are planning to go to thailand for our honeymoon.
our accommodation already includes breakfast. we don't drink and neither of us goes shopping unless we actually need to. i'm a smoker (one pack a day). neither of us likes nightlife activities (nightclubs, we don't drink, etc). we plan to maybe visit a couple of attractions max because we're both introverts and we'd rather just stay home.
based on these habits, do you think 3000 baht per day will be enough?

","boho;
back in 2018, my wife and i spent four days enjoying oxford and the surroundings.
your plans sound good for the time allowed. excellent you have scheduled a visit to blenheim palace.
we ate in the summertown area just about every day. we liked ""mama mia"", and ""joe's bar and grill"". we found the ""dancing dragon"" too noisy and mediocre. we also had a bad experience eating at ""mac donald bear"" at woodstock near blenheim palace (review below).
in general, oxford was a good experience for us, with only one disappointment as far as the attractions over there. my review of it is included here. hopefully, your visit will be better than mine.
our visit/tour to the library was great. too bad we were not allowed to take photos of the interior. if you visit moreton et marsh, perhaps you should also include a cotswold tour. we highly recommend ""the secret cottage"" tour operator (see review below). this i must add, was a pleasant surprise, normally, we find these sort of tours very rushed and not pleasant at all.
i will be glad to help with any questions you may have.

we've just booked our first trip to norfolk for the end of april, to celebrate our wedding anniversary. we're staying in a lovely cottage in rockland st mary with our dog, so i'm spending my time planning local activities for the week.
we'd love to hire a boat for the day and stop off at a few riverside pubs along the way. it looks like the nearest day hire place is in brundall, which looks on the map to be very close so i was hoping we could walk there. however upon further inspection it's the other side of the river yare and i can't see that there's any crossing points, does anyone with local knowledge know if there is any place we can cross the river between the two towns please, we don't mind a short detour?
any other local tips or recommendations also welcome. thank you ",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g186269-i919-k13466906-Staying_in_Rockland_St_Mary-Norfolk_East_Anglia_England.html,Staying in Rockland St Mary...,BelaB1984,"Ditchling, United...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BelaB1984?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,50,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,200,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,50,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,50,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,50,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,50,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,50,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,50,0.0,0.0,50,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,40000,"[""['book',"", ""'trip',"", ""'norfolk',"", ""'end',"", ""'april',"", ""'celebrate',"", ""'wed',"", ""'anniversary',"", ""'stay',"", ""'cottage',"", ""'rockland',"", ""'st',"", ""'mary',"", ""'dog',"", ""'spend',"", ""'time',"", ""'plan',"", ""'local',"", ""'activities',"", ""'week',"", ""'wed',"", ""'hire',"", ""'boat',"", ""'day',"", ""'stop',"", ""'riverside',"", ""'pubs',"", ""'way',"", ""'nearest',"", ""'day',"", ""'hire',"", ""'place',"", ""'brundall',"", ""'map',"", ""'close',"", ""'hop',"", ""'walk',"", ""'upon',"", ""'inspection',"", ""'side',"", ""'river',"", ""'yare',"", ""'see',"", ""'cross',"", ""'point',"", ""'local',"", ""'knowledge',"", ""'place',"", ""'cross',"", ""'river',"", ""'two',"", ""'towns',"", ""'mind',"", ""'short',"", ""'detour',"", ""'local',"", ""'tip',"", ""'recommendations',"", ""'welcome']""]",False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

we don’t want remote places (and stay areas good hospitals). want chiang mai southern beaches sure travel country preferrably plane.
also wonder cities/areas normally touristic worth visit covid times (it could abandoned).
korat near ubon, nice visit?
since we’re gonna quite long thailand tourists, much time need fill in. ideas advice regarding travel plan love hear it.","hi everyone,
soon i am traveling to thailand with my boyfriend (in may until half august). first we will go in quarantaine of course and after that we have 10 full weeks to spend in beautiful thailand.
after quarantaine we’ll spend time in bangkok and then go to ubon ratchathani (my family lives there). after that we still have no plans.
i’ve only been to chiang mai and phuket before and my boyfriend has never been to thailand. so it’ll be nice to see the highlights. we’re ready to explore a lot but not hop from place to place too quick.
we would like to explore city life, do cultural stuff, join tours, hiking & sport activities (easy level) and relax a lot (beach / swimming).
we don’t want to go to too remote places (and stay in areas with good hospitals). we want to go to chiang mai and southern beaches for sure and travel through the country preferrably by plane.
also i wonder if some cities/areas that are normally touristic would be worth it to visit now in covid times (it could be too abandoned).
korat is near ubon, would this be nice to visit?
since we’re gonna be quite long in thailand as tourists, there is much time that we need to fill in. if you have ideas and an advice regarding our travel plan i would love to hear it.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g293915-i3686-k13504676-Advice_Travel_Itinerary_Thailand_10_weeks-Thailand.html,Advice Travel Itinerary Thailand 10 weeks,Emma D,"Den Bosch, The...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/K7495JVemmad?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,50,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,50,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,50,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,50,0,0,0,200,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,30000,"[""['soon',"", ""'travel',"", ""'thailand',"", ""'boyfriend',"", ""'may',"", ""'half',"", ""'august',"", ""'quarantaine',"", ""'course',"", ""'10',"", ""'full',"", ""'weeks',"", ""'spend',"", ""'beautiful',"", ""'thailand',"", ""'quarantaine',"", ""'we’ll',"", ""'spend',"", ""'time',"", ""'bangkok',"", ""'ubon',"", ""'ratchathani',"", ""'family',"", ""'live',"", ""'plan',"", ""'i’ve',"", ""'chiang',"", ""'mai',"", ""'phuket',"", ""'boyfriend',"", ""'thailand',"", ""'it’ll',"", ""'see',"", ""'highlight',"", ""'we’re',"", ""'ready',"", ""'explore',"", ""'lot',"", ""'hop',"", ""'place',"", ""'place',"", ""'quick',"", ""'explore',"", ""'city',"", ""'life',"", ""'cultural',"", ""'stuff',"", ""'join',"", ""'tour',"", ""'hike',"", ""'sport',"", ""'activities',"", ""'easy',"", ""'level',"", ""'relax',"", ""'lot',"", ""'beach',"", ""'swim',"", ""'don’t',"", ""'remote',"", ""'place',"", ""'stay',"", ""'areas',"", ""'good',"", ""'hospitals',"", ""'chiang',"", ""'mai',"", ""'southern',"", ""'beach',"", ""'travel',"", ""'country',"", ""'preferrably',"", ""'plane',"", ""'wonder',"", ""'cities',"", ""'areas',"", ""'normally',"", ""'touristic',"", ""'worth',"", ""'visit',"", ""'covid',"", ""'time',"", ""'abandon',"", ""'korat',"", ""'near',"", ""'ubon',"", ""'visit',"", ""'we’re',"", ""'gonna',"", ""'quite',"", ""'long',"", ""'thailand',"", ""'tourists',"", ""'much',"", ""'time',"", ""'fill',"", ""'ideas',"", ""'advice',"", ""'travel',"", ""'plan',"", ""'hear']""]",False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

i have a silver cigarette box that was presented to my grandma when she left a thailand as a thank you for teaching the thais scottish country dancing. in 1989 she could not believe that the island she had called the last place on god’s earth was now a destination people called paradise and the number of hotels! a trip to the beach in the 1960s was a journey along bumpy roads, there were no hotels. i spent an amazing 5 weeks starting in bangkok, visiting pattaya, phuket, penang and kl, ending in singapore.
it was such an enjoyable trip that we returned in 1998 with my grandma and husband. her house in phuket was now inhabited and the communal pool empty. i would love to find out the exact location. my husband and i loved our trip, sadly we lost my grandma in 1999. it was a delightful surprise when my brother announced he was moving to bangkok in 2001 to teach for a few months, he intended to move onto japan and other countries, 20 years later he is still in bangkok and is now married with two children. we have managed to visit twice with our kids and once on our own and now hope to visit every year. last february was our first winter trip which was absolutely amazing to get away from the cold weather. can’t wait to be able to return and think it will be an annual winter trip for us.

thank you!","hoping it works out to go to thailand next year (booked refundable flights already for a great price!)
my original plan was to head to chiang mai area for the first 4-5 days, then finish the trip off with a week or so around koh tao/koh samui for some beach and diving time, then a night or two in bangkok before flying home.
then i discovered burning season might make chiang mai a bad idea (had not heard of that before)...
we have been to thailand once before a few years ago (dec/jan) and flew in/out of phuket, spent 2 weeks island hopping between there and koh lipe so would like to have a different experience this time.
what could we add in place of chiang mai for some mountainous, temple, jungle... experience? not too crazy about big cities, prefer laid back places (hence just a night or 2 in bangkok on the way home). i know we’d be happy at the beach but since that was all we did the first trip there just wanted to check out something other than just that this time around.

edited: 5:23 am, february 06,","m p ... hopefully it will clear up before you get here. this is the worst i've seen. thankfully only about 2 months vs the 5 months folks north of us have to deal with.
i do love it here, just a heads up post for those that research (not on this site obviously🤣 ) but choose your where & when carefully. north - crisp clear skies, in between the raindrops during green season, and lovely.
beach holiday (for in the surf or that turquoise look), not the gulf, unless just looking, and iffy all year imho. anyone tell you different, definitely has a vested interest. 20 yrs experience on both, and andaman sea side consistently better most of the year.

i plan book flights cancel book rooms option realise nobody knows what's going on. december light!
thanks much, feedback super helpful!

i agree, the boys are definitely men haha, i'm sure they will like a bit of a busy area for new year and they didn't want to travel too much (feedback was that my previous itineraries were too busy :d) so going somewhere with some watersports and nature options sounds good.
one last question please: is krabi/koh lanta very busy now? i guess this has equally changed or is it quieter than phuket? just in case they insist on a beach holiday.
i only plan to book flights i can cancel and will only book rooms with this option too as i realise nobody knows what's going on. i just hope by december there is light!
thanks very much, your feedback is super helpful!

hope all are safe and well. me and my wife, in late 30s, plan to travel to india in july 2021 for friends wedding (if all vaccination and all is done). we want to explore india and one of the places that came up is rajasthan.
i am seeing mixed reviews on the weather... some places mention july is the best time (due to onset of monsoon) whereas others suggest it may be too hot (95+ f) and not the best time to visit.
we want to spend around 7 days. we have jaipur/ jodhpur/ udaipur in mind. we are flexible to add or remove destinations but want to make our trip comfortable.

if you're planning to spend 10 days or more there, then i see nothing wrong at all with taking a day or two out to relax on a beach or beside a hotel pool - i've certainly done that myself! hong kong covers an area of over 2700 km², so there's plenty to see and do and over 700km of coastline to find a place to relax, but if you aren't going until next year, you've got loads of time to research and plan all that. if you decided to spend your entire 15 days there, then spending the first couple of days recovering from jetlag beside a hotel pool and the last couple of days lazing on a beach to prepare for the shock of going home, sounds like a good holiday to me!

if living in london, relative, you may or may not like the big mango. i know my first few visits, i hated it, and thought it nothing more than a giant slum. although, i did stay on lower suk, and didn't explore much. if used to squeaky clean western hygiene (appearance / smells (lack of sewer), then you can easily be put off.
now, after so many visits (100+) and still haven't seen it all, as krung thep metro is huge, i love arriving. and after a short week, i love leaving .... 🤣🤣🤣
being there on weekend has its pros & cons, more festive & more things open, but crowded. if you enjoy just knocking around & exploring a city's non touristy side, you'll love it.
but .... since coming from a big city, if so, and wanting beach time, you may want to prioritize that on first visit, as big city feeling can be found at home. especially coming from uk, as any beach, even thai's crappy ones along with warm weather would be a relief, from what i hear & read.🤣
my first thai beach experience was 20+ years ago, phuket, and got me on thinking about retiring in thailand. trip was actually a recon for retirement. 2nd beach holiday was pp, and sealed the idea.
hindsight, and when thailand opens to 'normal' tourism, i think pp would be my priority, as slow starting up again, before it turns back into a tourist ghetto, i think i'd prioritize my first visit after c19 there. save extensive exploration of the big mango for a later visit, as any changes there, will be for the better as they are revamping some areas already, and quite nicely.
about to revisit pp myself, before 2022, as looking lovely without tourist.
good thing not into ""museums/galleries"" .... they really suck here.

indeed, in normal years i usually reserve kyoto hotels at least 5 months in advance, especially for sakura blossoms. another option is to stay in osaka and commute to kyoto daily in about 1 hour. however, the later you book the higher the hotel rates (when cheaper rooms have been snatched up) and possibly in less convenient locations.
rain is a non-issue in either the sakura or koyo season. in general, rainy days cannot be ruled out in any season. however, in those 2 seasons it's due to passing frontal rain resulting in drizzles in a location for at most 2 to 3 days and that's it. it won't be like occasional heavy downpours during the rainy season in late june to mid july or during passing/landing typhoons.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g294232-i525-k13515559-Japan_Honeymoon-Japan.html,Japan Honeymoon,DLi_hk,HK,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DLi_hk?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,200,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,200,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,50,200,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,62500,"[""['spring',"", ""'blossom',"", ""'amaze',"", ""'quite',"", ""'gamble',"", ""'timelines',"", ""'book',"", ""'honeymoon',"", ""'2',"", ""'weeks',"", ""'advance',"", ""'may',"", ""'adventurous',"", ""'indeed',"", ""'normal',"", ""'reserve',"", ""'kyoto',"", ""'hotels',"", ""'least',"", ""'5',"", ""'months',"", ""'advance',"", ""'sakura',"", ""'blossom',"", ""'stay',"", ""'osaka',"", ""'commute',"", ""'kyoto',"", ""'daily',"", ""'1',"", ""'hour',"", ""'book',"", ""'higher',"", ""'hotel',"", ""'rat',"", ""'cheaper',"", ""'room',"", ""'snatch',"", ""'possibly',"", ""'less',"", ""'convenient',"", ""'locations',"", ""'rain',"", ""'non',"", ""'sakura',"", ""'koyo',"", ""'season',"", ""'general',"", ""'rainy',"", ""'days',"", ""'cannot',"", ""'rule',"", ""'season',"", ""'2',"", ""'season',"", ""'due',"", ""'pass',"", ""'frontal',"", ""'rain',"", ""'drizzle',"", ""'location',"", ""'2',"", ""'3',"", ""'days',"", ""'occasional',"", ""'heavy',"", ""'downpours',"", ""'rainy',"", ""'season',"", ""'late',"", ""'june',"", ""'mid',"", ""'july',"", ""'pass',"", ""'land',"", ""'typhoons']""]",False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

we are flying into osaka in early november, and out of sapporo in mid/late november (15 days total). we are willing to rent a car or take a train or take take flights between some of the locations… we want to see some cultural sights (temples, etc), eat great food, go hiking, visit an onsen or two, ride bikes around town, etc (not a huge fan of museums but might be willing to do one or two if they are can’t-miss). mostly just love to see (and eat) amazing things.
we love to mix it up too. city/country, luxe hotel/bnb/family-stay/camping, planned guided tours/spur-of-the-moment.
hoping to hit up the south/west when it might still be somewhat warm and see some fall colors, then head north/east (who knows if it will be snowing by then, which could be cool).
we usually like to spend at least three days in a location, so we could probably hit up four regions?
i don’t even know 100% that the trip will happen because of covid - of course it will all depend on what state the world (and japan) is it at the time. i am hopeful though.
would love any ideas of regions to visit, how long to stay there, how to get from one place to another, and any other tips!
thank you so much for your insight.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g294232-i525-k13555773-15_days_in_Japan_in_November_Osaka_to_Sapporo-Japan.html,15 days in Japan in November.

i think that the quality=mind of people in vietnam after new corona will surely return to 1990's when vietnam government officially opened their country to foreigners(=opened ""free traveling"" without getting parmission after entering into vietnam).
it's the storm of rips-off, scammings, agressive overchargings etc that vilently blew to foreign visitors in 1990's (it has also blown in vietnam till today).
people's mind for rips-off, scammings, agressive overchargings to foreign visitors in vietnam is ""immortal""(they are very thitsty now for getting their targets and victims due to the decreasing of the number of foreign visitors) so unless you do aboiding those bad acts concerning money conciously, safe and enjoyable travel is never guaranteed even if you aim to do anything you like and the beautiful scenery and food etc are the same to the past, or if the travel circumstances and means are restored.

i'm thinking 10 12 days 2022 trip, hoping covid issue point (my parents vaccinated) based research beginning dry season high season yet.
they never asia thought bali introduction continent, given cultural sightseeing beach life. also, live italy destinations good flight arrangements (i thinking thailand philippines flights convenient).
i'm thinking staffed villa couple reasons: first, love space away people. normally prefer quiet secluded places. second, experience amazing villa beach (i've done thailand amazing time) staff thinks everything. definitely meals, given gift want inclusive completely worry-free.
they sightseeing laying beach. dad loves diving mom doesn't, dive couple times only.
i idea splitting time two different parts island (i realize long takes cross island).
please let suggestions recommendations!","thank you all very much for the replies! all so helpful! here's a bit more information:
i'm thinking 10 or 12 days in may of 2022 for the trip, hoping that covid will not be an issue at that point (my parents are both vaccinated) and based on my research may is the beginning of the dry season but not high season yet.
they have never been to asia which why i thought of bali as a great introduction to the continent, given that it should be great for both cultural sightseeing and beach life. also, they live in italy and not all destinations have good flight arrangements (i was thinking of thailand and the philippines too but flights are just not convenient).
i'm thinking of a staffed villa for a couple of reasons: first, they love having space and being away from people. they normally prefer quiet and secluded places. second, i think it's an experience to have an amazing villa by the beach (i've done this in thailand before and had an amazing time) where the staff thinks of everything. and while they will definitely go out for a few meals, given that this is a gift i want it to be all inclusive and completely worry-free.
they both like sightseeing and laying on the beach. my dad loves diving but my mom doesn't, so he will probably dive a couple of times only.
i like the idea of splitting their time between two different parts of the island (i didn't realize how long it takes to cross the island).
please let me know if you have more suggestions and recommendations!",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g294226-i7220-k13556584-Best_area_to_stay_in_Bali_for_non_surfers-Bali.html,Best area to stay in Bali for non-surfers?,Riccardo B,0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/riccardobG4530HF?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,200,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,50,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,50.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,50,0,200,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,200,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,67500,"[""['much',"", ""'reply',"", ""'helpful',"", ""'heres',"", ""'information',"", ""'10',"", ""'12',"", ""'days',"", ""'may',"", ""'2022',"", ""'trip',"", ""'hop',"", ""'covid',"", ""'point',"", ""'parent',"", ""'vaccinate',"", ""'base',"", ""'research',"", ""'may',"", ""'begin',"", ""'dry',"", ""'season',"", ""'high',"", ""'season',"", ""'asia',"", ""'bali',"", ""'introduction',"", ""'continent',"", ""'cultural',"", ""'sightsee',"", ""'beach',"", ""'life',"", ""'live',"", ""'italy',"", ""'destinations',"", ""'good',"", ""'flight',"", ""'arrangements',"", ""'thailand',"", ""'philippines',"", ""'flight',"", ""'convenient',"", ""'staff',"", ""'villa',"", ""'couple',"", ""'reason',"", ""'space',"", ""'away',"", ""'people',"", ""'normally',"", ""'prefer',"", ""'quiet',"", ""'seclude',"", ""'place',"", ""'second',"", ""'experience',"", ""'amaze',"", ""'villa',"", ""'beach',"", ""'thailand',"", ""'amaze',"", ""'time',"", ""'staff',"", ""'meals',"", ""'gift',"", ""'inclusive',"", ""'completely',"", ""'worry',"", ""'free',"", ""'sightsee',"", ""'lay',"", ""'beach',"", ""'dad',"", ""'dive',"", ""'mom',"", ""'dive',"", ""'couple',"", ""'time',"", ""'idea',"", ""'split',"", ""'time',"", ""'two',"", ""'different',"", ""'part',"", ""'island',"", ""'realize',"", ""'long',"", ""'cross',"", ""'island',"", ""'suggestions',"", ""'recommendations']""]",False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

guessing op tourist...hence vid tourist area.
i show vid surfside rd (pkk), dead weekdays, street over, less 100 meters away, running parallel surf, never there's pandemic.
i'm pretty sure people themselves, state ""tourist areas' relying 'international tourism' (patong beach / bangla rd) affected. everyday living local areas, normal. people work, eat, shop & party.

guessing op would be a tourist...hence the vid of a tourist area.
i can show a vid of the surfside rd here (pkk), dead during weekdays, but one street over, less than 100 meters away, also running parallel to the surf, and you'd never know there's a pandemic.
i'm pretty sure people can think for themselves, as we all state ""tourist areas' relying on 'international tourism' (patong beach / bangla rd) are affected. not everyday living in more local areas, as more normal. people still work, eat, shop & even party.

if living in london, relative, you may or may not like the big mango. i know my first few visits, i hated it, and thought it nothing more than a giant slum. although, i did stay on lower suk, and didn't explore much. if used to squeaky clean western hygiene (appearance / smells (lack of sewer), then you can easily be put off.
now, after so many visits (100+) and still haven't seen it all, as krung thep metro is huge, i love arriving. and after a short week, i love leaving .... 🤣🤣🤣
being there on weekend has its pros & cons, more festive & more things open, but crowded. if you enjoy just knocking around & exploring a city's non touristy side, you'll love it.
but .... since coming from a big city, if so, and wanting beach time, you may want to prioritize that on first visit, as big city feeling can be found at home. especially coming from uk, as any beach, even thai's crappy ones along with warm weather would be a relief, from what i hear & read.🤣
my first thai beach experience was 20+ years ago, phuket, and got me on thinking about retiring in thailand. trip was actually a recon for retirement. 2nd beach holiday was pp, and sealed the idea.
hindsight, and when thailand opens to 'normal' tourism, i think pp would be my priority, as slow starting up again, before it turns back into a tourist ghetto, i think i'd prioritize my first visit after c19 there. save extensive exploration of the big mango for a later visit, as any changes there, will be for the better as they are revamping some areas already, and quite nicely.
about to revisit pp myself, before 2022, as looking lovely without tourist.
good thing not into ""museums/galleries"" .... they really suck here.

thanks much","i realize i asked my question on the wrong forum yesterday. my husband loves to swim in the ocean a couple times a day, and does not like the pool. i will do either. he is 72 and i 67. we will be in thailand for a month and want to spend a week each at two different beach locations near the end. this will be end of november so i think koh samui is out, although i loved it there.
i am reading lots of reviews and they are so divided on whether it is a good swimming beach or not so good. five years ago i was on koh phi pi and also railey beach and loved them, but with girlfriends and other than excursions out we just used the pools
we want to be on a great swimming beach
not a party atmosphere but a bit lively is fine
walking distance to shops and resteraunts.
my thoughts are. phi phi. railey beach, klong muang. koh lanta.
or somewhere i have not thought of
hin hua did not really appeal to me
any guidance is.most appreciated. we will be taking tours out to snorkel and visit other areas while there. our budget is moderate, we don’t need fancy just clean. but a splurge now and then is okay too. the two i originally thought of was phi phi relax beachfront cabin and railay village resort. but now doubting myself

edited: 3:41 pm, january 01,","im working on a rough outline of a 3 week itinerary for our first visit to japan, that is bound by set dates at the beginning and toward the end of the trip. the set dates are a sumo wrestling tournament in osaka on mar 28 and the takayama spring festival on apr 14. my husband and i have traveled extensively in asia, but never to japan. we generally prefer to have off the beaten path experiences that highlight natural beauty and culture, and that are combined with visits to must see tourist places. we are not really into big cities. im looking at visiting the following locations, and need advice on how to order the locations to minimize travel times, and also advice on # of full days at a location.
tokyo (fly in and out), perhaps spend one day at the end of the trip before flight home
osaka - 2 days
kyoto - 4 days
shikoku island - 4 days
kanazawa, takayama, shirakawa-go - 2-3 days
izu peninsula - 3-4 days
?? yakushima island - 2-3 days (would love to see the natural beauty of this island. my husband is 74 and i'm 59 and we are in decent physical shape. but with some surgeries we've had, now limit hiking to about 2 miles. would we miss out on what the island offers if we can't do the longer hikes?)

b","hi there,
i'm early 30s traveling with two others (moderate budget), just trying to get a feel for whether this itinerary is too ambitious. we have a week on either side of a 1-week destination wedding in galle, sri lanka (total approx 20 days). here is my proposed itinerary, very open to suggestions of where to stay (kerala houseboat, etc)/edits to make the trip more enjoyable and tolerable:
(day 1-2)
cheap, quick (1hr) flight from bangalore to madurai, see some tamil temples (good reference for experiencing sri lanka tamil vibes later), chill and shop for a day or two.
(day 3-4)
3.5hr private car transfer from madurai to thekaddy/periyar np for spice plantation exploration/bamboo rafting (these are the same place 7mi apart, so would spend two days here).
(day 5-6)
3.5hr private car transfer to alleppey where we would jump on a houseboat and chill on the canals of the arabian sea for a couple days.
(day 7)
1hr private transfer to kochi, a cool historical city offering flights back to bangalore which we have to go through anyway (i think!) to get a flight to colombo (sri lanka) where wedding would start.
(day 8-14)
once we fly into colombo, the initial west coastal travel (negombo to galle) occurs during the 27th to 2nd (as part of the wedding). the transfer would be with wedding guests and takes about 3 hours via private bus.
(day 15-16)
post-wedding, leave from galle to explore the tissa area (yala safari park w/ leopards and elephants, etc. with a 3.5hr private transfer) for two days.
(day 17-19)
from there, we transfer (anywhere from 2-5 hours, depending on which city/ies we choose) to central sri lanka which is kandy/ella/nuriwaya eliya area for three days.
(day 20)
then transfer (~3-4 hours depending on start point) to colombo/flight to bangalore/flight home.
looking forward to hearing your thoughts. also curious if you think covid could cause some issues along the way as well.

i *think* i'd - tied booking package - perhaps book room w/o hb/da ro b&b, basic room perhaps. way, that's 'bog standard' option easier compare/track across sales channels (websites/agents etc.) similarly, pruvo mentioned keep track price drops.
then far 'wriggle room' a) price drop - standard room available across places, thus chance drop - b) easier negotiate upsell check-in da package. believe me, gh able refuse option 'ancillary revenue' case missing group yours, given current economy.
if mention expo word, ignore them.
going anantara, look discovery loyalty program offers attractive it? 50 usd, could sign business travel subscription, program free offers discounts benefits select properties. worth pop perhaps?

i *think* what i'd do - if you're not tied to booking a package that is - is perhaps book the room w/o the hb/da either ro or b&b, probably just the basic room only perhaps. this way, that's the 'bog standard' option and easier to compare/track across more sales channels (websites/agents etc.) similarly, you can also pruvo as mentioned before to keep track of price drops.
then you've far more 'wriggle room' to get a) a price drop - as the standard room will be available across more places, thus more chance to drop - and b) easier to negotiate an upsell even at check-in for the da package. believe me, even gh won't be able to refuse the option of 'ancillary revenue' if it's a case of missing out on a group like yours, especially given the current economy.
if any of them mention the expo word, ignore them.
going back to the anantara, did you look into if the discovery loyalty program offers were attractive for it? for about 50 usd, you could sign up to business travel subscription, get the program free and it offers discounts and benefits at select properties. worth a pop perhaps?

i completely understand and i know that i am on the outer edge of optimism in moving forward with planning! maybe i'm suffering from ""vaccination fever"" (my second shot is next week...) and can't stop myself from planning to getaway!
that said, so much is changing so fast, in every possible direction, i wanted to have things in place in case things improve for all of us. and the flexibility of many of the services (accommodation, flights) make it a little easier to extend myself since they are either refundable and/or i can convert to open tickets (as i did last year...).
that said, i'm supposed to come for a project that is decidedly site-specific. my hope is to try and include some educational travel at the same time, with the caveat that i need to be aware i might be in quarantine or not allowed to come at all.

i got the flight deal for $225 to hnd from dallas, arriving early morning on monday 11/22 and departing mid-morning on wednesday 12/1.
i’d never really seriously considered a trip to japan before because the combo of the expensive flights + reputation as an expensive destination deterred me, but the price was too good to turn down.
there is (hopefully) going to be a sumo tournament in fukuoka while i’m there, so my initial thought was to fly to fukuoka to start and then work my way back north by train/bus.
what should i do? i’m into history and culture, natural beauty, but open to pretty much anything. would like to do a day at universal studios for nintendo+potter world. so that + the sumo are 2 days, and i basically have 7-8 more days to fill. what do i do?
i am a budget traveler so would love hostel or japanese-style guesthouse recs and cheap delicious eats suggestions. i could probably splurge on a nice dinner or two ($50-$100 per person range). i tend to save my money to spend on experiences so any tour suggestions or cool places i would love to hear.
the flights are flexible, and let’s assume that vaccinated travelers are allowed into japan without quarantine (i know that may end up not being the case), and that japan is in the new normal before the most recent lockdown coming up.
would love any itinerary suggestions!

if i understand you correctly, you recommend either bali, central java, and then gili meno (time permitting) in that order or bali, west/central flores, and then gili (time permitting) in that order? so, internationally, flying into bali and out of lombok? it's the international flights that i expect we'll want to book well in advance, so knowing where we're starting and ending the trip is more critical.
it sounds like java would be interesting for a different perspective and culture. what, in your own opinion, would be the interests/reasons for visiting western and central flores (beyond seeing the komodos, of course!)?

even domestic flights, you lose a fair chunk of time. so if you want to go to 3 places in thailand and 2 in malaysia, plus 2 international locations in a 3 week trip... it's a lot of time wasted in transit. my own rule of thumb from my experience in se asia is 1 city each 5 days maximum.
also personally, if wanting to relax at a beach location, in my opinion you need 6 or 7 nights minimum, to really get the relaxation benefit.

bangkok 4 nights centre point sukhumvit 10. sightseeing tour withlocals.com, snake farm and maybe siam park or similar in addition to some general wandering, eating, shopping etc.
sleeper to chiang mai (will book 1st class cabin in advance)
4-5 nights in cm, would love to stay at gaps house if family option available. elephant camp (day trip), night market, maybe cooking class.
fly to phuket and stay for approx 5 nights at centara grand karon
6 nights ko phi phi - phi phi the beach resort
back to phuket for the final week- katathani phuket beach resort. fly home from phuket.
i'm also interested in ko lanta but not sure how to fit in without a very long travel day and not a fan of packing up and moving too much with kids. re no of days my maths might be slightly off but you get the general idea :)
any thoughts, tips and advice greatly appreciated! thanks in advance ",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g293915-i3686-k13548533-Feedback_on_4_week_family_iteniary_BKK_CM_PHKT_Phi_Phi-Thailand.html,"Feedback on 4 week family iteniary BKK, CM, PHKT, Phi Phi",Caroline M,UK,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/T7669WRcarolinem?tab=forum,0,0,100,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,100,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,100,0,100,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,100,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,100,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,100,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,100,0,0,0,100,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,100,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,100000,"[""['hop',"", ""'spend',"", ""'35',"", ""'weeks',"", ""'thailand',"", ""'partner',"", ""'2',"", ""'kid',"", ""'68',"", ""'march',"", ""'april',"", ""'2022',"", ""'visit',"", ""'couple',"", ""'time',"", ""'kid',"", ""'keep',"", ""'travel',"", ""'time',"", ""'minimum',"", ""'avoid',"", ""'long',"", ""'distance',"", ""'road',"", ""'younger',"", ""'lad',"", ""'car',"", ""'sick',"", ""'esp',"", ""'heat',"", ""'long',"", ""'haul',"", ""'trip',"", ""'mix',"", ""'affordable',"", ""'luxury',"", ""'accomm',"", ""'budget',"", ""'options',"", ""'wed',"", ""'kid',"", ""'friendly',"", ""'sightsee',"", ""'shop',"", ""'nature',"", ""'beach',"", ""'strenuous',"", ""'plan',"", ""'far',"", ""'grateful',"", ""'advice',"", ""'bangkok',"", ""'4',"", ""'nights',"", ""'centre',"", ""'point',"", ""'sukhumvit',"", ""'10',"", ""'sightsee',"", ""'tour',"", ""'withlocalscom',"", ""'snake',"", ""'farm',"", ""'siam',"", ""'park',"", ""'similar',"", ""'addition',"", ""'general',"", ""'wander',"", ""'eat',"", ""'shop',"", ""'sleeper',"", ""'chiang',"", ""'mai',"", ""'book',"", ""'1st',"", ""'class',"", ""'cabin',"", ""'advance',"", ""'4',"", ""'5',"", ""'nights',"", ""'cm',"", ""'stay',"", ""'gap',"", ""'house',"", ""'family',"", ""'elephant',"", ""'camp',"", ""'day',"", ""'trip',"", ""'night',"", ""'market',"", ""'cook',"", ""'class',"", ""'fly',"", ""'phuket',"", ""'stay',"", ""'approx',"", ""'5',"", ""'nights',"", ""'centara',"", ""'grand',"", ""'karon',"", ""'6',"", ""'nights',"", ""'ko',"", ""'phi',"", ""'phi',"", ""'phi',"", ""'phi',"", ""'beach',"", ""'resort',"", ""'phuket',"", ""'final',"", ""'week',"", ""'katathani',"", ""'phuket',"", ""'beach',"", ""'resort',"", ""'fly',"", ""'home',"", ""'phuket',"", ""'interest',"", ""'ko',"", ""'lanta',"", ""'fit',"", ""'long',"", ""'travel',"", ""'day',"", ""'fan',"", ""'pack',"", ""'move',"", ""'much',"", ""'kid',"", ""'days',"", ""'maths',"", ""'slightly',"", ""'general',"", ""'idea',"", ""'thoughts',"", ""'tip',"", ""'advice',"", ""'greatly',"", ""'advance']""]",False,True,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

i think i limit a lot of options being a 6 and 5 star that’s not a small mortgage .... hb i am keen on (at least b&b) because teenage children eat masses .... by my calculation i’m looking at a £50 per day per person spend for 2 courses my children unfortunately with me being a former chef are not the nuggets kids - they requested sushi at xmas after having it the year before at zabeel.
so really i need an excellent hb hotel and then can upgrade from there. fairmont are a 1/3 cheaper for their half board but reviews on the hb offering are terrible and i think i would find i would then need to dine out which of course would bring in the taxi cost and at that a larger vehicle each time. so would in turn bump up the price anyway.

such a shame it came to that , ive been at christmas and never experienced that , even out of covid its been fine and not mad crazy , id look at perhaps different hotels next time , i personally i am always put off with the haboor as two many deals offered by some agents and being on the beach brings folk in but it always never really had good customer service . the worse place i ever saw at xmas was the mina al salam that was over run with kids and parents just plain drunk , and shouting at each other ,one woman in her best tucker flat out on the floor crying her heart out . that was some years ago but , it was just to much and i wouldnt stay there either at christmas as again to many people coming in from its various hotels on site
.we tend to stay at ghh and ive found that fine even with lrm pool and beach ive never felt descended on .
you clearly like the nice things in life , id recommend somewhere a bit smaller maybe in the city with a good pool deck for winter sunshine , maybe versace or something similar would suit better if you did want to go again at xmas.
im def going to have the bulgari brunch next time we visit .",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g295424-i872-k13458609-Trip_Review_20_December_3_Jan-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html,Trip Review 20 December - 3 Jan,lovedogs1234,UK,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lovedogs1234?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,50,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,50,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,50,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,50,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,50,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,50,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,50,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,200,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,37500,"[""['fantastic',"", ""'report',"", ""'food',"", ""'recommendations',"", ""'nye',"", ""'pp',"", ""'day',"", ""'beach',"", ""'place',"", ""'pool',"", ""'time',"", ""'shame',"", ""'christmas',"", ""'experience',"", ""'covid',"", ""'fine',"", ""'mad',"", ""'crazy',"", ""'different',"", ""'hotels',"", ""'time',"", ""'personally',"", ""'haboor',"", ""'two',"", ""'many',"", ""'deal',"", ""'agents',"", ""'beach',"", ""'bring',"", ""'folk',"", ""'good',"", ""'customer',"", ""'service',"", ""'worse',"", ""'place',"", ""'ever',"", ""'saw',"", ""'xmas',"", ""'mina',"", ""'al',"", ""'salam',"", ""'run',"", ""'kid',"", ""'parent',"", ""'plain',"", ""'drink',"", ""'shout',"", ""'one',"", ""'woman',"", ""'tucker',"", ""'flat',"", ""'floor',"", ""'cry',"", ""'heart',"", ""'much',"", ""'stay',"", ""'christmas',"", ""'many',"", ""'people',"", ""'various',"", ""'hotels',"", ""'site',"", ""'tend',"", ""'stay',"", ""'ghh',"", ""'fine',"", ""'lrm',"", ""'pool',"", ""'beach',"", ""'felt',"", ""'descend',"", ""'clearly',"", ""'life',"", ""'recommend',"", ""'smaller',"", ""'city',"", ""'good',"", ""'pool',"", ""'deck',"", ""'winter',"", ""'sunshine',"", ""'versace',"", ""'something',"", ""'similar',"", ""'suit',"", ""'xmas',"", ""'def',"", ""'bulgari',"", ""'brunch',"", ""'time',"", ""'visit']""]",False,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

whilst location amwaj great, it’s inclusive limited, stayed inclusive launched cost £60 ( total nights) upgrade b&b ai brainer equated £5 pp per day!
however booked several months later paid significantly opinion i’d disappointed i’d paid top money. drinks limited (no cocktails) whilst food nice choices somewhat limited.
i couldn’t complain got money day soft drinks alone unless absolute bargain again, wouldn’t opt inclusive hotel staying area.
i’ve stayed palm tree court half dozen times couple years, heard it’s got slightly restrictive recently i’ve stayed offers extensive choice restaurants food good quality, it’s town resort itself.
rixos - stayed twice, b&b short stay fine ai. prefer rooms resort ptc it’s modern opinion nicer pool area. food good don’t it’s quite good ptc choice isn’t extensive buffet decent drinks quality variety. it’s furthest hotel palm feels less far ptc .
personally i’d opt cheapest ptc rixos they’re excellent.
as riu, haven’t stayed, intend it’s 4* suspect it’ll limited food & drinks package ptc rixos.","i’ve stayed at all three of those hotels on an all inclusive basis.
whilst the location of the amwaj is great, it’s all inclusive is limited, when i stayed their all inclusive had just launched and it only cost me £60 ( that was total for 3 of us for 4 nights) to upgrade from b&b to ai so it was a no brainer as it equated to £5 pp per day!
however those who had booked several months later paid significantly more and in my opinion i’d have been very disappointed if i’d paid top money. drinks are limited (no cocktails) and whilst the food is nice your choices again are somewhat limited.
i couldn’t complain as i got my money back on the first day in soft drinks alone but unless it was an absolute bargain again, i wouldn’t opt for all inclusive in this hotel or when staying in this area.
i’ve stayed at palm tree court half a dozen times but not for a couple of years, i have heard it’s got slightly more restrictive recently however when i’ve stayed it offers the most extensive choice of restaurants and food is really good quality, it’s out of town and is a resort in itself.
rixos - stayed twice, once b&b on a short stay and another fine ai. i prefer the rooms and resort to ptc as it’s more modern and in my opinion has a nicer pool area. the food is very good but i don’t think it’s quite as good as ptc and the choice isn’t as extensive but the buffet is decent as is are the drinks quality and variety. even though it’s the furthest hotel out on the palm it feels less far out than ptc .
personally i’d opt for the cheapest between ptc and rixos as they’re both excellent.
as for riu, i haven’t stayed, nor do i intend to but it’s 4* and i suspect it’ll be more limited on the food & drinks package than ptc or rixos.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g295424-i872-k13471468-Best_All_inclusive-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html,😎 Best All inclusive 😎,hannahengland,UK,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hannahengland?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,100,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,400,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,100.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,225,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,66875,"[""['i’ve',"", ""'stay',"", ""'three',"", ""'hotels',"", ""'inclusive',"", ""'basis',"", ""'whilst',"", ""'location',"", ""'amwaj',"", ""'it’s',"", ""'inclusive',"", ""'limit',"", ""'stay',"", ""'inclusive',"", ""'launch',"", ""'cost',"", ""'£60',"", ""'total',"", ""'3',"", ""'4',"", ""'nights',"", ""'upgrade',"", ""'bb',"", ""'ai',"", ""'brainer',"", ""'equate',"", ""'£5',"", ""'pp',"", ""'per',"", ""'day',"", ""'book',"", ""'months',"", ""'pay',"", ""'significantly',"", ""'opinion',"", ""'i’d',"", ""'disappoint',"", ""'i’d',"", ""'pay',"", ""'top',"", ""'money',"", ""'drink',"", ""'limit',"", ""'cocktails',"", ""'whilst',"", ""'food',"", ""'choices',"", ""'somewhat',"", ""'limit',"", ""'couldn’t',"", ""'complain',"", ""'money',"", ""'day',"", ""'soft',"", ""'drink',"", ""'alone',"", ""'absolute',"", ""'bargain',"", ""'wouldn’t',"", ""'opt',"", ""'inclusive',"", ""'hotel',"", ""'stay',"", ""'area',"", ""'i’ve',"", ""'stay',"", ""'palm',"", ""'tree',"", ""'court',"", ""'half',"", ""'dozen',"", ""'time',"", ""'couple',"", ""'hear',"", ""'it’s',"", ""'slightly',"", ""'restrictive',"", ""'recently',"", ""'i’ve',"", ""'stay',"", ""'extensive',"", ""'choice',"", ""'restaurants',"", ""'food',"", ""'good',"", ""'quality',"", ""'it’s',"", ""'town',"", ""'resort',"", ""'rixos',"", ""'stay',"", ""'twice',"", ""'bb',"", ""'short',"", ""'stay',"", ""'fine',"", ""'ai',"", ""'prefer',"", ""'room',"", ""'resort',"", ""'ptc',"", ""'it’s',"", ""'modern',"", ""'opinion',"", ""'nicer',"", ""'pool',"", ""'area',"", ""'food',"", ""'good',"", ""'don’t',"", ""'it’s',"", ""'quite',"", ""'good',"", ""'ptc',"", ""'choice',"", ""'isn’t',"", ""'extensive',"", ""'buffet',"", ""'decent',"", ""'drink',"", ""'quality',"", ""'variety',"", ""'it’s',"", ""'furthest',"", ""'hotel',"", ""'palm',"", ""'feel',"", ""'less',"", ""'far',"", ""'ptc',"", ""'personally',"", ""'i’d',"", ""'opt',"", ""'cheapest',"", ""'ptc',"", ""'rixos',"", ""'they’re',"", ""'excellent',"", ""'riu',"", ""'haven’t',"", ""'stay',"", ""'intend',"", ""'it’s',"", ""'4',"", ""'suspect',"", ""'it’ll',"", ""'limit',"", ""'food',"", ""'drink',"", ""'package',"", ""'ptc',"", ""'rixos']""]",True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

edited: 5:10 pm, january 10,","andrew, while nusa dua might offer you the type of hotel you are after, you may find yourselves bored witless if you spend 2 weeks there. as advised, it's basically a manufactured resort area with not much to offer. and if you really do go ai, then you'll be stuck at your hotel day in, day out, eating at the same places/same menus for the whole time. as long as you are aware of this of course, and just want a holiday where you sit on the beach or around the pool for the two weeks, then this idea may be perfectly fine for you.
you have also been advised about travel times in bali. and nusa dua is a long way from most of the interesting things to do and see. as an example, if you wanted to do/see anything around ubud, then allow 3-4 hours in the car to get there and back. that means you'll be missing the meals you have paid for back at your hotel. as well as sitting in a car travelling the same roads you have already travelled.
most people who go to bali do not stay in one area for two weeks, many visit 2-3 parts of bali, to experience the island more fully.
you also may like to reconsider hiring a car to go off exploring. driving in bali is not for the feint hearted. roads are narrow, not signposted and traffic is more than horrendous. most of us do use a driver with car and arrange our day trips. cost is around 600,000 idr per car, not per person and you can discuss with your driver the things you want to see. however, if you book at your hotel in nd, then expect to pay a whole lot more than this. also do beware of set ""tours"" which often charge per person.
can i suggest that you do a whole lot more research, and decide what you really want from your honeymoon. bali has so very much to offer, that it would be a shame not to see any of it while you were there. you could start by reading about the areas of bali, link below. also, on a computer (not phone) read the top questions about bali, right hand side of the bali forum front page
whatever you decide, i hope you have a wonderful honeymoon.

my husband planning 2022 honeymoon indonesia appreciate help itinerary (side note: got married pandemic, pandemic circumstances pushed trip ""newlyweds"" 2022!) obviously much see many islands, mindful cramming much. pandemic wanderlust making decisions difficult though!
budget issue we'd spend solid two weeks in-country, including travel time. could extend couple days beyond 14 days need be, vacation time saved then!
we want split trip - half exploring breathtaking nature, culture/temples, unique experiences adventures (nothing strenuous, moderate hiking/biking/snorkeling definitely speed), second half relaxing continuing breathtaking natural beauty (away lots tourists! beaten path, understand hard two-ish weeks).
we're currently thinking:
1) days exploring bali (specifically, ubud northern eastern bali. care visit bali's kuta super touristy areas, care nightlife)
2) 3-4 days exploring lombok (specifically, staying southern lombok beaches near lombok's kuta. perhaps road tripping driver/guide east and/or west stopping explore local villages culture? we're quite mount rinjani crater rim hike, beaches southern lombok luxury villa sound nice us. want explore though, sit beach - suggestions worthwhile check lombok?)
3) 3-4 days mayahana resort gili meno - time need seriously nothing chill beach :)
4) return last night bali heading home.
what plan above? days distributed well? anything adjusted/swapped out?
i'd love recommendations best explore lombok.
lastly, missing getting sumatra, java, and/or flores? places ""worthwhile"" swapped lombok/gili meno? originally looking exploring flores/komodo, scuba dive (only snorkel) seemed less practical lombok terms travel logistics. feedback suggestions really, appreciated! thanks!!","hi fellow travelers -
my husband and i are planning a may 2022 honeymoon to indonesia and would really appreciate some help with the itinerary (side note: we got married just before the pandemic, but the pandemic and other circumstances have pushed our first trip as ""newlyweds"" to 2022!) there is obviously so much to see and so many islands, but we are mindful of not cramming in too much. my pandemic wanderlust is making decisions very difficult though!
budget isn't really an issue and we'd like to spend a solid two weeks in-country, not including travel time. we could even extend this by a couple days beyond 14 days if need be, with all that vacation time we will have saved up by then!
we really want to split the trip - first half exploring breathtaking nature, culture/temples, having unique experiences and adventures (nothing too strenuous, but moderate hiking/biking/snorkeling are definitely our speed), and the second half really relaxing and continuing to take in breathtaking natural beauty (away from lots of tourists! we would like to get off the beaten path, but understand that can be hard with only two-ish weeks).
we're currently thinking:
1) 7 days exploring bali (specifically, ubud and northern and eastern bali. we don't care to visit bali's kuta or any of the super touristy areas, nor do we care about nightlife)
2) 3-4 days exploring lombok (specifically, staying in southern lombok at one of the beaches near lombok's kuta. perhaps road tripping with a driver/guide to the east and/or west and stopping to explore local villages and culture? we're not quite up for the mount rinjani crater rim hike, but beaches in southern lombok with a luxury villa sound nice to us. we still want to explore though, not just sit on a beach - does anyone have suggestions for worthwhile things to check out on lombok?)
3) 3-4 days at mayahana resort on gili meno - this is all the time we need to seriously do nothing but chill on a beach :)
4) return for one last night in bali before heading home.
what do you think of the plan above? are the days distributed well? anything that should be adjusted/swapped out?
i'd also love recommendations for how to best explore lombok.
lastly, will we be missing out by not getting to sumatra, java, and/or flores? are any of these places more ""worthwhile"" to be swapped out with lombok/gili meno? we originally were looking at exploring flores/komodo, but we don't scuba dive (only snorkel) and it seemed less practical than lombok in terms of travel logistics. feedback and suggestions would be really, really appreciated!

for overall relaxation luxury i’d madinat trumps palace downtown. there’s extensive choice restaurants bars within madinat it’s ideal honeymoon hotel setting.

do you mean hotels within the jumeirah chain such as one of the hotels within the madinat resort?
if so i’d pick one of these over palace downtown. the palace is closer to dubai mall & burj khalifa but they’re within easy reach by taxi from the madinat as is g&d park.
for overall relaxation and luxury i’d say madinat trumps over palace downtown. there’s an extensive choice of restaurants and bars within the madinat and i always think it’s an ideal honeymoon hotel for its setting.
palace is better placed if you want the mall on your doorstep but the hotel itself isn’t as good.
for a 3 night honeymoon stopover i don’t think you can go wrong with the madinat as it has a beautiful setting without being too far from most of the attractions. the only downside is in school holidays jumeirah property hotels can be very busy",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g295424-i872-k13498419-Jumeirah_Hotels_or_Palace_Downtown-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html,Jumeirah Hotels or Palace Downtown,hannahengland,UK,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hannahengland?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,80,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,80,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,80,500,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,59600,"[""['jumeirah',"", ""'hotels',"", ""'refer',"", ""'hotels',"", ""'jumeirah',"", ""'chain',"", ""'one',"", ""'hotels',"", ""'madinat',"", ""'resort',"", ""'i’d',"", ""'pick',"", ""'one',"", ""'palace',"", ""'downtown',"", ""'palace',"", ""'closer',"", ""'dubai',"", ""'mall',"", ""'burj',"", ""'khalifa',"", ""'they’re',"", ""'easy',"", ""'reach',"", ""'taxi',"", ""'madinat',"", ""'gd',"", ""'park',"", ""'overall',"", ""'relaxation',"", ""'luxury',"", ""'i’d',"", ""'madinat',"", ""'trump',"", ""'palace',"", ""'downtown',"", ""'there’s',"", ""'extensive',"", ""'choice',"", ""'restaurants',"", ""'bar',"", ""'madinat',"", ""'it’s',"", ""'ideal',"", ""'honeymoon',"", ""'hotel',"", ""'set',"", ""'palace',"", ""'place',"", ""'mall',"", ""'doorstep',"", ""'hotel',"", ""'isn’t',"", ""'good',"", ""'3',"", ""'night',"", ""'honeymoon',"", ""'stopover',"", ""'don’t',"", ""'wrong',"", ""'madinat',"", ""'beautiful',"", ""'set',"", ""'far',"", ""'attractions',"", ""'downside',"", ""'school',"", ""'holiday',"", ""'jumeirah',"", ""'property',"", ""'hotels',"", ""'busy']""]",False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

also planning major sightseeing anything them, possibly dubai mall dessert safari, stroll marina evening mainly spending time together hotel pool/beach worries me.
they obviously fine usual swimsuits holidays place lot instagram models come pose tiny bikinis them,
thank","hi guys we are planning our honeymoon to the maldives and on the way back stopping in dubai to meet up with our parents who are quite reserved, i note dubai in general is very relaxed in terms of topless sunbathing, thong bikinis etc
i'm thinking would atlantis be a good choice as it is very family oriented? so maybe there would be less of this at this particular hotel?
they will be on route to singapore so will only be stopping in dubai for 3 days to meet us, the rest of the time we spend there we will pick another resort that will be more suited to a honeymoon.
also we aren't planning any major sightseeing or anything for while we are there with them, possibly just dubai mall and a dessert safari, probably a stroll around the marina one evening but we will mainly just be spending time together at the hotel pool/beach so this is what worries me.
they are obviously fine with the usual swimsuits on holidays but just if it is a place where a lot of instagram models come to pose in their tiny bikinis it may not be for them,

hiring a car may be worth it as you’ll need a couple of taxis i would imagine - it will just be a little easier for all. i would organise the hire for a day after arrival (not straight off the flight).",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g295424-i872-k13583535-Dubai_mid_July_with_family-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html,Dubai mid July with family,Sean R,UK,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/275seanr?tab=forum,0,0,50,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,50,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,50,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,50,0,0,0,50,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,200,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,32500,"[""['deal',"", ""'beach',"", ""'hotel',"", ""'sea',"", ""'hot',"", ""'bath',"", ""'hardly',"", ""'walk',"", ""'5m',"", ""'sand',"", ""'ruin',"", ""'feet',"", ""'pool',"", ""'personally',"", ""'2',"", ""'hotels',"", ""'one',"", ""'near',"", ""'dubai',"", ""'mall',"", ""'easy',"", ""'access',"", ""'indoor',"", ""'activities',"", ""'resort',"", ""'style',"", ""'place',"", ""'flop',"", ""'days',"", ""'pool',"", ""'normally',"", ""'chill',"", ""'kid',"", ""'work',"", ""'hire',"", ""'car',"", ""'may',"", ""'worth',"", ""'you’ll',"", ""'couple',"", ""'taxis',"", ""'imagine',"", ""'little',"", ""'easier',"", ""'organise',"", ""'hire',"", ""'day',"", ""'arrival',"", ""'straight',"", ""'flight']""]",False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

i don't know which is more seedy local women dancing on tables on short shorts or foreign women and men on beaches dressed in dental floss.
i was sitting at a table at a café on road one block back from the beach in pattaya (which is a lot less conservative than phuket).
a young local working girl was sitting with her older foreign holiday boyfriend. a foreign tourist in a bikini walked by. i heard the young lady remark 'she is not shy' in relation to foreign tourist. i thought for a local that her understanding of english and the use of sarcasm was pretty good. wearing swimwear not on or near the beach or in shopping centres (which i have seen) is perhaps seen as a foreigner thing.

we would love to explore small towns with lovely temples, nature, markets, history, anything... before we spend 4 nights in hua hin (we do not plan to see bkk city).

we’d booked flights and our maldives hotel through luxtripper so i’m just waiting for them to get back to me with a price for our new dates and i’d booked the grosvenor house on a free cancellation basis so i can sort that.
it’s a bit of a bummer as i am slightly concerned about the august heat and humidity- we’ve done orlando in august please tell me it’s not too much worse that that?!
the positive is that we can now go for a bit longer as previously we were restricted to the easter holidays so rather than 3 nights grosvenor were now looking at 3 nights grosvenor and 2 nights atlantis and it’s coming in at pretty much the same price- i didn’t realise how much cheaper it was to go in august!",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g295424-i872-k13462215-Changing_honeymoon_date-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html,Changing honeymoon date,lwragg,UK,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lwragg?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,100,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,100,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,100,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,100,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,100,100,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,60000,"[""['forum',"", ""'useful',"", ""'plan',"", ""'honeymoon',"", ""'dubai',"", ""'maldives',"", ""'easter',"", ""'we’ve',"", ""'decision',"", ""'delay',"", ""'wed',"", ""'2nd',"", ""'april',"", ""'12th',"", ""'aug',"", ""'we’d',"", ""'book',"", ""'flight',"", ""'maldives',"", ""'hotel',"", ""'luxtripper',"", ""'i’m',"", ""'wait',"", ""'price',"", ""'new',"", ""'date',"", ""'i’d',"", ""'book',"", ""'grosvenor',"", ""'house',"", ""'free',"", ""'cancellation',"", ""'basis',"", ""'sort',"", ""'it’s',"", ""'bummer',"", ""'slightly',"", ""'concern',"", ""'august',"", ""'heat',"", ""'humidity',"", ""'we’ve',"", ""'orlando',"", ""'august',"", ""'tell',"", ""'it’s',"", ""'much',"", ""'worse',"", ""'positive',"", ""'longer',"", ""'previously',"", ""'restrict',"", ""'easter',"", ""'holiday',"", ""'3',"", ""'nights',"", ""'grosvenor',"", ""'3',"", ""'nights',"", ""'grosvenor',"", ""'2',"", ""'nights',"", ""'atlantis',"", ""'it’s',"", ""'pretty',"", ""'much',"", ""'price',"", ""'didn’t',"", ""'realise',"", ""'much',"", ""'cheaper',"", ""'august']""]",False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

áine","hello,
myself and my fiancé are currently planning our honeymoon to thailand for the very start of january 2022 through our travel agent. we are both in our late 20’s and enjoy nice food, beautiful beaches, outdoor activities and occasional nights out. our itinerary at the moment is looking like this but we are not sure if we are moving about too much or capturing the best beach locations.
- 2 nights in bangkok (including new years night) in the chatrium hotel riverside
- 3 nights in koh samuel in the six senses hotel
- 3 nights in koh tao in the haad tien beach resort (we have done some research on this hotel and have found a lot of bad reviews)
- 5 nights in krabi in the phulay bay ritz carlton
- 2 nights in koh sok national park
- 2 nights in koh lak in the sarojin
- 2 night stop over in dubai on our way home
along with concerns about too much moving around, we are also wondering if anyone would be able to comment on our specific route or hotels? there seems to be a lot of areas or islands to go to so we feel a little bombarded with options and would greatly appreciate some advice.
thanks very much,

1st, muay thai gyms exist in practically every city in thailand, and your hotel could arrange muay thai workouts at your hotel if you request it.
no, 10 days is too long for chiang mai and any other single destination in thailand for a first-time visitor to thailand, chiang mai is not centrally-located, and does not offer a well-rounded thailand travel experience.
yes, 10 days is adequate if you want to earn a ph.d. in chiang mai. as michaelb stated above, chiang mai provides a good base for exploring the surrounding cities that he mentioned above, especially exploring chiang rai in the north.

most tourists in japan use the train system, which is extensive and reliable. gasoline and highway tolls are expensive, traffic congestion is a problem in the big cities, and parking is limited, so renting a car makes sense only if you want to visit rural areas.
it would make sense to include kyoto in your trip, and to take the shinkansen train from tokyo to kyoto.

we just don’t want to hit a month that is a majority of the time raining every day, and may november appeared to be good months, we want to relax by a pool day on beach as well as the sights sounds of hong kong.
also hoping may 22 all should be vaccinated appreciate world view of uk however we will all be vaccinated by september latest this year folk here think we are crackers as they feel hong kong china may not have same time frame for vaccinations due to population number.
i can actually see us all having to pay privately to get a covid test proving negative before entry to country’s as well as proof of vaccinations at least our first two are free.

thank","hi everyone!
can you list names of hotels and resorts which offer rooms, suites, or villas designed specifically for honeymooners as accommodation type?
that would include: - special welcome - beach dinner - cake sometimes - private pool designed - some activities in the resort ... etc..
search engines and website shows 'romantic' and 'good for couples' but not specifically for honeymooners.
we know that anyone can request specific arrangements for honeymoon from any hotel, but in this post i am looking to have a list of hotels that offer this type of specific honeymooners packages and your experiences if you had tried them.

hope work, follow advice slow down,","i wouldn't book anything yet. you will have to see how covid affects your plans, it's to early to know what it'll be like next autumn. but it's a great time to be planning the trip, that's half the fun.
to me, your trip would be a nightmare! far too many destinations. i'd concentrate on malaysia and singapore. a week in singapore would give you enought time to enjoy the highlights, add a few more days and you'll start to feel you're getting to know the city.
i always prefer to start the trip with a few days on the beach relaxing. get used to the new country, and get over jet lag. singapore has some nice beaches, and great facilities.
i did the train from singapore to kl when it was one train the whole way. it's ok but it's mostly flat countryside with lots and lots of palm oil trees. nowadays as myrm pointed out, it's very complicated, so i'd prefer to fly. a possible alternative would be to use the shuttle train, bus or taxi (complicated so get advice if you choose this) to cross the border. when i visited malaysia long distance taxis were easy to get, so that might be an option. get advice on the malaysian forums.
hope you can make it work, but do follow the advice to slow down, and",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g294265-i1748-k13623295-Malaysia_Indonesia_Itinerary-Singapore.html,Malaysia/Indonesia Itinerary,HeatSeekerWrexham_UK,UK,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HeatSeekerWrexham_UK?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,100.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,100,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,20000,"[""['book',"", ""'see',"", ""'covid',"", ""'affect',"", ""'plan',"", ""'early',"", ""'itll',"", ""'autumn',"", ""'time',"", ""'plan',"", ""'trip',"", ""'half',"", ""'fun',"", ""'trip',"", ""'nightmare',"", ""'far',"", ""'many',"", ""'destinations',"", ""'concentrate',"", ""'malaysia',"", ""'singapore',"", ""'week',"", ""'singapore',"", ""'enought',"", ""'time',"", ""'highlight',"", ""'add',"", ""'days',"", ""'start',"", ""'feel',"", ""'city',"", ""'prefer',"", ""'start',"", ""'trip',"", ""'days',"", ""'beach',"", ""'relax',"", ""'new',"", ""'country',"", ""'jet',"", ""'lag',"", ""'singapore',"", ""'beach',"", ""'facilities',"", ""'train',"", ""'singapore',"", ""'kl',"", ""'one',"", ""'train',"", ""'whole',"", ""'way',"", ""'mostly',"", ""'flat',"", ""'countryside',"", ""'lot',"", ""'lot',"", ""'palm',"", ""'oil',"", ""'tree',"", ""'nowadays',"", ""'myrm',"", ""'point',"", ""'complicate',"", ""'prefer',"", ""'fly',"", ""'alternative',"", ""'shuttle',"", ""'train',"", ""'bus',"", ""'taxi',"", ""'complicate',"", ""'advice',"", ""'cross',"", ""'border',"", ""'visit',"", ""'malaysia',"", ""'long',"", ""'distance',"", ""'taxis',"", ""'easy',"", ""'advice',"", ""'malaysian',"", ""'forums',"", ""'work',"", ""'advice',"", ""'slow']""]",False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

in the uk you do not have to change your passport to your married name until it expires and as mine has 5 more years that is why i haven't done that. i have also already booked flights etc in my maiden name. i was hoping that if i carried my marriage certificate and also the prescription and a letter from my doctor that would be sufficient.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g293920-i5037-k13502190-Taking_prescription_medication-Phuket.html,Taking prescription medication,Fiona V,Barrow-in-Furness...,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fionav841?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,100,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,100,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,100,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,100,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,100,100,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,60000,"[""['reply',"", ""'phuket',"", ""'wasnt',"", ""'medication',"", ""'see',"", ""'restrict',"", ""'drug',"", ""'gabapentin',"", ""'isnt',"", ""'2',"", ""'weeks',"", ""'manage',"", ""'codeine',"", ""'uk',"", ""'passport',"", ""'marry',"", ""'name',"", ""'expire',"", ""'5',"", ""'book',"", ""'flight',"", ""'maiden',"", ""'name',"", ""'hop',"", ""'carry',"", ""'marriage',"", ""'certificate',"", ""'prescription',"", ""'letter',"", ""'doctor',"", ""'sufficient']""]",False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

i'd never have found that thread without your link, so thank you.
the op in that link, is a carbon copy of what we're looking for.
the op decision to change locations to varlarka, is interesting, it's a pity they didn''t come back and report whether varlarka met their requirements.
we have mixed vibes about kerela, (kovalam) especially the beach, from the many youtube vidioes we've watched, the popularity of the beach was nothing compared to our beach holiday in southern goa (we stayed at the radisson blu)
if i could pick up theradisson blu, beach (including shacks) and place it in kerela, we'd have found the perfect holiday location
i appreciate it comes down to individual preference, given our experience of southern goa, we were spoilt

i would like to know how i could find out whether the ban has been lifted and/or for how long the ban is still valid?
also,i am looking for a genuine good lawyer who could help me getting a divorce being overseas from my ex-husband who is still in india.does anyone know someone ? i really suffered a lot and i would like to get some support from this forum to start fixing my legal status in india.
thank you,

plenty to see and do in the local area, before the op joins their tour which presumably includes the 'big ticket' items in kolkata.

as the heritage b'n'b is linked to calcutta walks, exploring further afield is no problem.

rak isn’t in dubai, it’s a completely different emirate and whilst brochures and agents might try and sell it as being in close proximity it’s worth remembering that dubai is very spread out and it might take several hours to get from
parts of rak to some parts of dubai.
whilst rak has a number of all inclusive hotels that are popular there isn’t much at all to see in rak and many of the hotels are quite remote, it’s more geared towards people who are wanting to stay in resort.
given you were looking to go to nyc & vegas i’m guessing sightseeing and a livelier holiday is what you had in mind so i’d definitely recommend dubai.
dubai hotels are more expensive than rak if you’re looking for ‘like for like’ however there are several all inclusive hotels in dubai alternatively just opt for b&b or hb and stay somewhere more central, take advantage of drinks promotions and ladies nights ( where you get free or discounted drinks) which will be ideal given you’re travelling with your mum.
although dubai isn’t renowned for being a cheap destination, the last time i was in nyc i thought prices there had risen dramatically and at least in dubai it is possible to have a cheaper night out! ladies nights are the way to go as it’s possible to find somewhere almost every night of the week where they have drinks promotions on.

(2) as stated in a previous post, there is no certainty that thailand will be fully open for tourist during the end of the year, and when thailand is re-opened, it will take time before the cities return to pre-pandemic state.
(3) you are seeking a beach destination in thailand to use as a base for day trips to explore thailand. whether you prefer an island (like phuket or samui), or mainland beach city (like rayong, hua hin, pattaya), none of them are centrally located to use as a base to experience thailand's historic attractions, culture, rural, and other experiences.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g293915-i3686-k13533735-Best_beach_for_1_month_stay_in_Thailand-Thailand.html,Best beach for 1-month stay in Thailand?,CharlesR,US,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VacationerCritic?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,100,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,100,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,100,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,100,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,40000,"[""['read',"", ""'items',"", ""'post',"", ""'1',"", ""'assume',"", ""'progressive',"", ""'manner',"", ""'normal',"", ""'thailand',"", ""'fast',"", ""'california',"", ""'progress',"", ""'faster',"", ""'state',"", ""'2',"", ""'state',"", ""'previous',"", ""'post',"", ""'certainty',"", ""'thailand',"", ""'fully',"", ""'open',"", ""'tourist',"", ""'end',"", ""'thailand',"", ""'open',"", ""'time',"", ""'cities',"", ""'pre',"", ""'pandemic',"", ""'state',"", ""'3',"", ""'seek',"", ""'beach',"", ""'destination',"", ""'thailand',"", ""'base',"", ""'day',"", ""'trip',"", ""'explore',"", ""'thailand',"", ""'whether',"", ""'prefer',"", ""'island',"", ""'phuket',"", ""'samui',"", ""'mainland',"", ""'beach',"", ""'city',"", ""'rayong',"", ""'hua',"", ""'hin',"", ""'pattaya',"", ""'none',"", ""'centrally',"", ""'locate',"", ""'base',"", ""'experience',"", ""'thailands',"", ""'historic',"", ""'attractions',"", ""'culture',"", ""'rural',"", ""'experience']""]",False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

my opinion prefer spend time ubud sanur. you’re visiting thai beaches beaches bali nothing special. bali unique balinese hindu culture. many beautiful hotels ubud overlooking jungle rice fields. traffic horrendous bali ubud closer many attractions sanur is.
enjoy honeymoon.","“ 3. is there any other alternatives that we should do to make the most of our trip?”
my opinion only but i would prefer to spend more time in ubud than sanur. you’re already visiting thai beaches and the beaches in bali are nothing special. bali is more about the unique balinese hindu culture. there are many beautiful hotels in ubud overlooking jungle or rice fields. the traffic is horrendous in bali and ubud is closer to many attractions than sanur is.

the main street is also pedestrianised. caol, banavie and corpach just outside of fort william also have a nice hotel and numerous b&b's.

i was just looking at registry fees for cornwall weddings and it seemed even more expensive than most london offices.
i was married by an appellate court judge, a friend of a friend, in his chambers (office). it cost us nothing other than the license fee, though we did send the judge a case of good wine as a thank you.

","here's a tip that may help.. make a 'dummy booking' for the rooms you're considering at one or two hotels, on a cancellable basis, and (ideally) for room only or b&b. email that booking to pruvo (it's free, then let them track the price drops from now until you're ready to book)
then, when your agent offers you a rate for the hotels, you know 'how cheap' you can get the booking for and ask them to price match. they may. or may not, but it's always worth asking - then you can put that money saved towards your activities, drinks whatever. sometimes the fact an agent knows a traveller is savvy is. enough leverage you need to get a better deal, either a discount or upgrade or added benefits etc.
the reason i recommend booking a room on b&b or ro is they are easier to compare across the open market, whereas rooms with 'free' upgrades, packages etc aren't as comparable.

what happens decide somewhere great, find usually dealbreaker look elsewhere. son says forget food going paying resort. said fairmont looks resort compared caesars w guess pay wow factor food swayed fairmont. book fairmont last night mentions wifi, email supplement price went similar anatara went drawing board.
i guess somewhere unusual/exclusive beach good food caesers, bnb price half board cant eat site effectively paying room wasteful enjoying food.
haha sound validation found antara late last night, tried research new contender trusting eyes taking pros cons son look cant unless willing pay compromise guess 🤣
saw mention pruvo added extension onto browser. i'm looking hotel only. booked flights emirates seperately. research queen, well , looked booking direct, comparison sites, member sites lots ota.
even dukes hotels competing deal, tried understand cheaper, food choices? booked separately stay wyndham marina nights bnb night lapita could spend days parks, days left play with. book stay wyndham lapita night days (with let keep cases loyal customers hahawhilst lapita overnight) dinner w palm lapita (and straight there) next night hells kitchen paying useless day resort well using breakfast next morning staying h/b. lapita stay bnb night resort, rushing lapita half board lunch. makes sense travel resorts palm (excluding antara away) cost forth taxis","haha good answer shaun,as my post does sound like a gold bunch of things and yeah does feel like a jumble sale, fed up of looking now and getting more picky 🤣 were not usually fussy but were starting to get that way when your paying £200 per night. we went to atlantis for the day last time,so dont need to stay there or pay that much to stay there for example.
what happens is we decide on somewhere great, then find out more about it then there is usually a dealbreaker then we look elsewhere. even my son says forget the food what are you going or paying for in the resort. he even said fairmont looks like any other resort compared to caesars or w but guess you pay for the wow factor and the food swayed us in fairmont. was about to book for fairmont last night then he mentions the wifi, i get the email about the supplement and the price went up and is similar as anatara so went back to the drawing board.
i guess for me and him somewhere unusual/exclusive on the beach with good food like caesers, but bnb here is the same price as half board so cant eat off site so will be effectively paying for the room which is wasteful and not enjoying the food.
haha does sound like validation but only found antara late last night, tried not to research it before but it's a new contender and not trusting my own eyes and taking in all the pros and cons my son is yet to look but you cant have it all unless your willing to pay or compromise i guess 🤣
saw you mention pruvo so have added the extension onto my browser. i'm looking at hotel only. we booked flights with emirates seperately. i am a research queen, well i like to think so anyway , so looked at booking direct, comparison sites, member sites and lots of ota.
even with dukes i know some hotels are competing with deal, but we tried to understand why it was a bit cheaper, maybe the food choices? booked separately to stay at wyndham marina for 7 nights bnb and a night at lapita so we could spend a few days in the parks, we then have 5 days left to play with. we might book to stay wyndham after lapita for a night out of those days (with the hope they will let us keep our cases there as loyal customers hahawhilst at lapita overnight) because we are having dinner at w palm after lapita (and can go straight there) and the next night at hells kitchen and think we may be paying for a useless day at the resort as we well just be using the breakfast the next morning if staying h/b. if not after lapita we will stay bnb for one night even if it's in a resort, or we will be rushing back from lapita just to make use of half board for lunch. hope that makes sense as travel between all resorts on the palm (excluding antara as its further away) all cost the same back and forth in taxis",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g295424-i872-k13644812-We_thought_we_narrowed_down_our_hotel_and_how_does_everyone-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html,We

239,9391,UAE,"shaun try chin 
oh son surprised answered intentional, thought . show i'm home prob laugh answer. thought last night, last email fairmont threw me, don't! son succinct tries me, i'm asking much.
the golden tip dubai hotels - pick right location, right hotel, find right deal.
i seen advice great, booked marina saw advice looking resort properties. mentioned exclusivity something different least that's chose resorts mentioned.
haha makes sense confused, yes want half board originally discounted dine meant constantly moving eat wanted good onsite food. going look now, looking available past days cravings decided fairmont..was put credit aswell assumed lookong menus examples rhodes cover starter counter productive look again.
funnily enough ive ever done price match/best rate guarantee lots t&cs thought.
yes biggest factor terms pricing dining supplement, son expected frevo didn't. diffent country, anywhere ive supplement steak etc. long suprise cost cant complain choose eat there. yes priced adult mostly, trying avoid supplements can.
haha want find beach resort that's got decent hb package, honestly thought said asked. looked aloft palm, expensive mo wow factor didnt decent onsite dining something scratched list. dilemma moving daily eat done everyday wyndham thanks suggestion. find pm/brg understand 25% discount.
sorry w palm akira back, gave reasons earlier scrapped staying there. yes bonkers that's extra night wyndham bnb nights h/b. night bnb yes eat dinner caesers hb credit lunch check wyndham.
i thought booked 4/5 dinners good deal didnt need travel eat anymore, hence importance decent restaurants site possible
i look entertainer initially didnt work properly phone (narrowed search luxury cope looking menus seeing credit bought) need laptop out, didnt needed it. 'run numbers', agree travelling eat every night exhausted need least days moving choosing town locally lunch (whilst staying marina resort).
i try look caesers, w palm others b&b, want r/o eating three meals much me. haggling, experience overcharge i'm want upgrade want try best rate deal go. son knows i'm mortified that, used life 🤣
shame dukes definitely out.
drinks - i'm name saving money cocktails similar pricing london keep eye happy hour son allowed site happy hour ends wherever be. what's mmi a&e (i guess hospital i've many drinks 🤣). emirates boarding pass good things, mostly found deals good idea buisness. offers cravings using pass.
dubai place spend save rather cheap. see now, dont last visits (with family ex) way hot hot drink alcohol ignore cheers🤣🤣 otherwise end a&e
thank much watched video aloft, ghh lrm whilst typed tube way home 🤣","hey shaun haha ok i will try to take it on the chin 
oh no haha my son will not be surprised that i haven't answered not intentional, thought i had . i will show him when i'm home he will most prob laugh at my answer. i thought i did last night, but the last email from fairmont threw me, maybe i don't! my son can be and is more succinct and tries to do this with me, so maybe i'm asking for too much.
the golden tip for dubai hotels is - pick the right location, then the right hotel, then find the right deal.
i had seen your advice before and it's great, i had already booked on the marina then saw your advice after looking at resort properties. i think i mentioned exclusivity or something different at least that's why we chose the resorts i mentioned.
haha makes sense why your confused, yes we do want half board and originally discounted dine around because it meant constantly moving to eat but we wanted good onsite food. but going to look at this again now, we were looking at what was available for the past few days on more cravings but then decided on fairmont..was put off on the credit aswell as assumed without lookong at menus for examples that rhodes would even cover a starter so counter productive but will look again.
funnily enough i think ive only ever once done price match/best rate guarantee as there are lots of t&cs but can give that a thought.
yes the biggest factor in terms of pricing and dining is the supplement, my son expected it at frevo i didn't. i know its a diffent country, but anywhere else ive been the supplement is for steak etc. so long as its not a suprise cost i cant complain if i choose to eat there. yes he is priced as an adult mostly, so trying to avoid supplements where we can.
haha yeah i get it but we do want to find a beach resort that's got a decent hb package, i honestly thought that is what i said when you asked. we looked at aloft on the palm, but it was very expensive with mo wow factor and didnt have decent onsite dining and there was something else that scratched it off the list. also same dilemma about moving daily to eat when we would have done that already everyday when we were at the wyndham but thanks for the suggestion. will go back through to find out what pm/brg is to understand the 25% discount.
sorry w the palm for akira back, but gave reasons earlier why we scrapped staying there. yes it is bonkers and that's why we would have an extra night at wyndham bnb and 4 nights h/b. the first night bnb yes we would eat dinner at caesers but we would use the hb credit for lunch after we check out of the wyndham.
i thought as we had booked 4/5 dinners already on a good deal we didnt need to travel to eat out anymore, hence the importance for decent restaurants on site which i know is not always possible
i did look in the entertainer initially but didnt work properly on my phone (narrowed the search to luxury and couldn't cope with looking at more menus and seeing what our credit bought) need to get the laptop out, and didnt think we needed it. even if i did 'run the numbers', we both agree travelling to eat out every night we will be exhausted so need at least a few days of not moving and choosing to go around town or locally for lunch (whilst staying at the marina or a resort).
i did try to look at caesers, w palm and a few others b&b, as we don't want r/o eating out for three meals is too much even for me. i do like haggling, but in my experience they overcharge when i'm there if i want an upgrade so want to try and get the best rate or deal before i go. my son knows what i'm like he would be mortified if i did that, he is used to me doing this for most things in life 🤣
shame about dukes but definitely out.
drinks - i'm ok without in the name of saving money will get a few cocktails here and there as its very similar pricing to london and will keep an eye out for happy hour if my son is allowed on site before happy hour ends wherever that may be. what's mmi and a&e (i guess you don't mean the hospital after i've had too many drinks 🤣). emirates boarding pass is good for a few things, but mostly found better deals good idea for them and buisness. they have offers on more cravings too using the pass.
dubai is a place you have to spend to save rather than get things cheap. i think i see that now, dont know what i did on my last few visits haha (with family and an ex) was way too hot too hot to drink alcohol anyway and will ignore cheers🤣🤣 otherwise i will end up in a&e

ahh oberior seen conrad popped looking resort ignored check raffles instead wyndham week look prices.
will look entertainer app easier website, going last visit decided reason.
dont booked suites got free airport taxi pick (if 45 minutes doubt) , free transfers riva beach resort, free moe marina metro shuttle, 25% f&b wild wadi tickets bnb basis nights £350 thought good deal eat, sleep swim. wrong? definitely want days flop drop dont double city stay suggestion good idea.
hilton walk look thought decided look again
thanks much helpful advice suggestions long night reviewing","thanks lovedogs
ahh oberior not seen it but conrad popped up but because we were looking a resort we ignored those but will check out raffles but will be instead of wyndham for the week will have a look a prices.
will look at the entertainer app may be easier than the website, was going to use this on my last visit decided against it for some reason.
dont think we booked the suites but got a free airport taxi pick up (if we make it out in 45 minutes which i doubt) , free transfers to riva beach resort, free moe and marina metro shuttle, 25% off f&b and wild wadi tickets on bnb basis for 7 nights for £350 so thought it was a good deal to eat, sleep and swim. am i wrong? we definitely want a few days flop and drop so dont think we will do a double city stay which i think is your suggestion but good idea.
hilton on the walk was one to look at but thought we had decided but will look again

cravings making bookings travelling alot week. forgotten emirates pass started everything made enquiries cost difference dont worry. h/b going reservation dinner eat casually rest. bnb reservations dinner.
with anantara tax included, yes tourism tax that's said 630 total roughly extra £15. happy caesers reviewing rest enough research easily pick hotel next time, i'm sure marina wasnt 10 years ago unless missed it. knowing dubao hotels next time look haha

duncan bannatyne 🤣
no only ever 2 people me and my son 
our budget for hb was just something within reason and pricing up what we had found, that's why we considered lrm/ghh and ceasers as it stretched the budget. when we found a deal we went with that given the usual costs 650/700 was what was coming up constantly. weve looked at the entertainer and that would have worked better if we could have got a good price bnb but it all adds up, and as we have pre booked other nice meals starting to figure out the deals in this wasnt nessecary as we were happy with what we had but will look again .. would allow greater leverage including
cravings and making more bookings and doing more travelling as we do this alot in the first week. haven't forgotten the emirates pass i started with everything in there and made enquiries as to the cost difference dont worry. when were h/b were only going to make one reservation for dinner and eat casually for the rest. when were bnb we have more reservations for dinner.
with anantara tax etc was included, yes it was the tourism tax that's why i said 630 in total was roughly an extra £15. were happy with caesers now and after reviewing all the rest think we have enough research to easily pick a hotel next time, as i'm sure the marina wasnt there 10 years ago unless we missed it. knowing dubao there will be better hotels next time we look haha

we’re now going to be going in august which i appreciate isn’t the best time to go weather wise but i sure we’ll make the most of it!
anyhow, our flight now gets in at midnight so we’re going to book the airport premier inn for £31 on the arrival night to just get our heads down and shower before then getting up and going to our first hotel. we’re going to be doing 3 nights grosvenor house and 2 nights atlantis (i keep toying with the idea of a night in the baa but that’s not for definite yet!)
we’ll be club level in both atlantis and grosvenor and both check in at 2pm. which hotel are we better off staying at first do you think? is one likely to be better than the other if we arrive early morning say 10am ish? i know there’s going to be no guarantee of an early room check in but i was thinking of facilities and stuff to be doing while we’re waiting? or equally is one likely to be better than the other when we won’t be leaving dubai until around 10pm ish on check out day? will need to leave our bags and have a shower and change somewhere?
thanks so much for all your help!
oooooh, just one more thing, both hotels offer free hotel transport because we’re staying club level. will there be an issue them getting us from the premier inn at the airport or will we have to go back to the terminal? i’m assuming the premier inn isn’t walkable from terminal 3?
thanks everyone x",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g295424-i872-k13471215-More_honeymoon_help-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html,More honeymoon help!,lwragg,UK,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lwragg?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,180,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,80,500,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,64000,"[""['you’ve',"", ""'helpful',"", ""'term',"", ""'book',"", ""'honeymoon',"", ""'originally',"", ""'sort',"", ""'easter',"", ""'we’ve',"", ""'decision',"", ""'delay',"", ""'wed',"", ""'obviously',"", ""'we’ll',"", ""'honeymoon',"", ""'we’re',"", ""'august',"", ""'isn’t',"", ""'time',"", ""'weather',"", ""'wise',"", ""'we’ll',"", ""'anyhow',"", ""'flight',"", ""'midnight',"", ""'we’re',"", ""'book',"", ""'airport',"", ""'premier',"", ""'inn',"", ""'£31',"", ""'arrival',"", ""'night',"", ""'head',"", ""'shower',"", ""'hotel',"", ""'we’re',"", ""'3',"", ""'nights',"", ""'grosvenor',"", ""'house',"", ""'2',"", ""'nights',"", ""'atlantis',"", ""'keep',"", ""'toy',"", ""'idea',"", ""'night',"", ""'baa',"", ""'that’s',"", ""'definite',"", ""'we’ll',"", ""'club',"", ""'level',"", ""'atlantis',"", ""'grosvenor',"", ""'2pm',"", ""'hotel',"", ""'stay',"", ""'one',"", ""'arrive',"", ""'early',"", ""'morning',"", ""'10am',"", ""'ish',"", ""'there’s',"", ""'guarantee',"", ""'early',"", ""'room',"", ""'facilities',"", ""'stuff',"", ""'we’re',"", ""'wait',"", ""'equally',"", ""'one',"", ""'won’t',"", ""'dubai',"", ""'10pm',"", ""'ish',"", ""'day',"", ""'bag',"", ""'shower',"", ""'much',"", ""'help',"", ""'oooooh',"", ""'one',"", ""'hotels',"", ""'free',"", ""'hotel',"", ""'transport',"", ""'we’re',"", ""'stay',"", ""'club',"", ""'level',"", ""'premier',"", ""'inn',"", ""'airport',"", ""'terminal',"", ""'i’m',"", ""'assume',"", ""'premier',"", ""'inn',"", ""'isn’t',"", ""'walkable',"", ""'terminal',"", ""'3']""]",False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

do these areas sound like a good mix of places to visit? also, most tour guides state you have to pay transportation but also says they will meet you at your hotel/place you’re straying.
so does that mean we would need to pay for their travel from their place to ours, back to the place we want to visit, then back to their home? i’m not sure what train tickets cost but would it be cheaper to purchase them a rail pass if we intend on using the guide for multiple days? i guess i am unsure how that works as i would assume most people who use public transport already have a rail pass. so how would we pay for his transport?",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g294232-i525-k13456197-Non_high_populated_places_to_visit-Japan.html,Non-high populated places to visit?,Bri Ebner,US,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dasbreenee?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,200,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,50.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,50,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,25000,"[""['haven’t',"", ""'travel',"", ""'much',"", ""'past',"", ""'children',"", ""'wasn’t',"", ""'time',"", ""'we’ve',"", ""'vacation',"", ""'live',"", ""'small',"", ""'town',"", ""'25k',"", ""'people',"", ""'travel',"", ""'larger',"", ""'cities',"", ""'largest',"", ""'225k',"", ""'people',"", ""'it’s',"", ""'large',"", ""'city',"", ""'people',"", ""'aren’t',"", ""'super',"", ""'condense',"", ""'guide',"", ""'triple',"", ""'light',"", ""'may',"", ""'tour',"", ""'areas',"", ""'chiba',"", ""'hakone',"", ""'kamakura',"", ""'kanagawa',"", ""'narita',"", ""'saitama',"", ""'tokyo',"", ""'yokohama',"", ""'air',"", ""'bnb',"", ""'locate',"", ""'sanmu',"", ""'chiba',"", ""'prefecture',"", ""'host',"", ""'helpful',"", ""'tour',"", ""'local',"", ""'area',"", ""'narita',"", ""'kamakura',"", ""'cute',"", ""'small',"", ""'cities',"", ""'amount',"", ""'larger',"", ""'city',"", ""'tour',"", ""'areas',"", ""'sound',"", ""'good',"", ""'mix',"", ""'place',"", ""'visit',"", ""'tour',"", ""'guide',"", ""'state',"", ""'pay',"", ""'transportation',"", ""'meet',"", ""'hotel',"", ""'place',"", ""'you’re',"", ""'stray',"", ""'pay',"", ""'travel',"", ""'place',"", ""'place',"", ""'visit',"", ""'home',"", ""'i’m',"", ""'train',"", ""'ticket',"", ""'cost',"", ""'cheaper',"", ""'purchase',"", ""'rail',"", ""'pass',"", ""'intend',"", ""'guide',"", ""'multiple',"", ""'days',"", ""'guess',"", ""'unsure',"", ""'work',"", ""'assume',"", ""'people',"", ""'public',"", ""'transport',"", ""'rail',"", ""'pass',"", ""'pay',"", ""'transport']""]",False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

sea being a sedimented green sea. the mix of big city and beach will be a hard one as da nang is the only one that springs to mind, and at that time of year the beach may be uncomfortable due to onshore wind conditions.

just 2 days ago tho at night in the dark 2 people were rescued from this area, the cliff was dangerous, they were stuck and the tide rising swiftly around them. pure luck and some very couragous volunteers on the lifeboat found them
thankfully it's been not too bad down here for crowds, the freezing wind is not conducive to beach or moorland except for the very hardy.
camper parked under the ' no campers' sign on the seafront where our coffee van usually parks was stupid and annoying but on the whole people have been good, kind and careful just getting a coffee and going for a walk.
it is the complete lack of knowledge of the sea, the beach and private land that people think is all safe and fun. the seas are running high and the easterly winds making them dangerous.

i have been reading extensively the info on this forum so i have couple of questions to be answered if you can, please. we are invited to a wedding in one of the suburbs of tokyo.
travelling with 15yr old girl for 10-12days.
i know things with the virus are difficult, but hopefully we can leave uk after mid june, and it’s just right date to attend the wedding if all works well. in that spirit please advice me accordingly
—- invited for a traditional shinto marriage ceremony , so what kind of gift to offer, and what faux pas not to do?
—- do i get train ticket for train travel or rent a car for all 9-11 days in the country?
—- planning to have daily budget of $110 for two a day including places to stay. already found some decent air bandb stays , is that budget enough?
—is it prudent to travel on big distances? we would keep to tokyo, kawasaki, yokohama, kumagaya, but if it’s doable under circumstances can we add kyoto and osaka, flying home from osaka .
any info very much appreciated, specially all your help for trip planning during this pandemic
much love nlgirl06

speaking of bride and groom pictures, have seen so many in kyoto before pandemic at shirakawa river and kamo river bank park. those people speak mostly chinese language. so i guessed their honey moon tour may include taking photos as kyoto's attraction wearing japanese kimono. did you recognize couples you have seen at kanazawa river speak japanese language? of course we can see japanese couples at the good spot, but not many today. have verified in a wedding site in japanese, you need to have translation engine in your browser to read through. they call it “photo wedding.”

after looking your kanazawa photo; the bride wearing kimono is not exactly for wedding uchikake we have since 15th century. normally brides wear uchikake and white cap named tsunokakusi (hiding horns) for ceremony. since head portion of bride was hided by the umbrella, i am not sure if she is a bride.

she wears just furisode (long sleeve kimono) . uchikake has long hem just like western wedding dress. so a bride needs to have bridemaids to get out. see wedding planner's page:

of course there are many others that will cater to your honeymoon requirements. it is just a matter of stipulating what you want when booking.
there is a company that specialises in all honeymoon holidays called the se7en holiday. it probably would be worthwhile taking a look at their website if only to get ideas.

good luck with your planning.

please guide me on what to do, i'm really confused, a little help would be really appreciated.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g294225-i7219-k13569882-Is_bali_opened_for_tourism-Indonesia.html,Is bali opened for tourism,Khawaja ali,"Gujranwala, Pakistan",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/khawajaali94?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,200,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,50,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,22500,"[""['hello',"", ""'guy',"", ""'plan',"", ""'honeymoon',"", ""'trip',"", ""'bali',"", ""'pakistan',"", ""'bali',"", ""'open',"", ""'tourism',"", ""'open',"", ""'tourism',"", ""'restrictions',"", ""'quarantine',"", ""'14',"", ""'days',"", ""'bali',"", ""'secondly',"", ""'pakistan',"", ""'country',"", ""'travel',"", ""'bali',"", ""'pakistan',"", ""'bali',"", ""'see',"", ""'temples',"", ""'beach',"", ""'sight',"", ""'bali',"", ""'see',"", ""'metropolitan',"", ""'country',"", ""'commercial',"", ""'activites',"", ""'apart',"", ""'beach',"", ""'landscape',"", ""'guide',"", ""'confuse',"", ""'little',"", ""'help']""]",False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

i wonder how peaceful it will be in the night at jb, and how private it is down by the beach, as we’re not interested in nightlife nor do we drink, and like to feel cut off from other resorts. if we stay most of the time in jb in the outside area of our premier ocean villa then that kind of defeats the purpose of staying at the beach in the first place..... any advice?",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g294226-i7220-k13470422-Bali_four_seasons_Sayan_versus_Jimbaran_Bay_possibseychelles-Bali.html,Bali four seasons Sayan versus Jimbaran Bay/possibseychelles,Bambina132,US,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bambina132?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,100,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,100,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,100,0,0,0,100,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,40000,"[""['visit',"", ""'four',"", ""'season',"", ""'sayan',"", ""'july',"", ""'2019',"", ""'food',"", ""'name',"", ""'tranquillity',"", ""'seclusion',"", ""'originally',"", ""'spay',"", ""'6',"", ""'nights',"", ""'travel',"", ""'sister',"", ""'property',"", ""'jimbaran',"", ""'bay',"", ""'4',"", ""'nights',"", ""'much',"", ""'sacred',"", ""'river',"", ""'spa',"", ""'son',"", ""'peaceful',"", ""'name',"", ""'stay',"", ""'entire',"", ""'1o',"", ""'days',"", ""'feel',"", ""'long',"", ""'finally',"", ""'book',"", ""'vacation',"", ""'pandemic',"", ""'begin',"", ""'whether',"", ""'stick',"", ""'we’ve',"", ""'book',"", ""'6',"", ""'nights',"", ""'jimbaran',"", ""'bay',"", ""'6',"", ""'nights',"", ""'sayan',"", ""'4',"", ""'5',"", ""'jb',"", ""'8',"", ""'7',"", ""'sayan',"", ""'sayan',"", ""'can’t',"", ""'wrong',"", ""'haven’t',"", ""'beach',"", ""'holiday',"", ""'four',"", ""'season',"", ""'punta',"", ""'mita',"", ""'december',"", ""'2019',"", ""'we’ve',"", ""'rebooked',"", ""'december',"", ""'mostly',"", ""'son’s',"", ""'enjoyment',"", ""'cultural',"", ""'center',"", ""'turtle',"", ""'release',"", ""'program',"", ""'jimbaran',"", ""'bigger',"", ""'may',"", ""'less',"", ""'personal',"", ""'feel',"", ""'i’m',"", ""'four',"", ""'season',"", ""'seychelles',"", ""'point',"", ""'distant',"", ""'future',"", ""'book',"", ""'much',"", ""'beach',"", ""'6',"", ""'nights',"", ""'bali',"", ""'properties',"", ""'oppose',"", ""'time',"", ""'sayan',"", ""'wonder',"", ""'peaceful',"", ""'night',"", ""'jb',"", ""'private',"", ""'beach',"", ""'we’re',"", ""'interest',"", ""'nightlife',"", ""'drink',"", ""'feel',"", ""'cut',"", ""'resort',"", ""'stay',"", ""'time',"", ""'jb',"", ""'outside',"", ""'area',"", ""'premier',"", ""'ocean',"", ""'villa',"", ""'kind',"", ""'defeat',"", ""'purpose',"", ""'stay',"", ""'beach',"", ""'place',"", ""'advice']""]",False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

the reason in asking the question of the number of days is to suggest places you can go in that time frame.
i am not much of a beach person myself,the good beaches in thailand often mean a lot of travel.
i have been to patong , did not think much of it, but it was easy to get to. i can drive about 1.5 hours from my house and be a really nice beaches
budget does help as well, if you are happy to spend then it can improve the experience . doing a cheap boat trip with many people would not be as good private tour in new boat, with guide and really nice food.
is it really phuket you want to go ? perhaps koh samui would be better.

edited: 10:01 am, january 31,","keith: bear in mind that many western countries (including my home) are in lockdown, so the 2 weeks of quarantine here are not much more restricted than if i was back in toronto (not to mention the minus 10 temp lol). i am here for 3-4 months, so well worth the 2 week sacrifice, but still obviously not worth it for a 3-4 week holiday.
it's a sacrifice, but not the least bit depressing. looking forward to my valentines weekend getaway to hh in 2 weeks!

phuket is good for tours, but we also enjoyed koh samui and khao lak with kids.
2 weeks is too much to stay in one place imo, but i think bangkok, chiang mai and a beach destination is doable with kids.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g293920-i5037-k13519781-Family_holiday_with_kids_Phuket_or_other_places-Phuket.html,Family holiday with kids Phuket or other places,Poida69,AU,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Poida69?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,100,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,100,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,100,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,30000,"[""['1',"", ""'skip',"", ""'inclusive',"", ""'place',"", ""'breakfast',"", ""'phuket',"", ""'good',"", ""'tour',"", ""'koh',"", ""'samui',"", ""'khao',"", ""'lak',"", ""'kid',"", ""'2',"", ""'weeks',"", ""'much',"", ""'stay',"", ""'one',"", ""'place',"", ""'imo',"", ""'bangkok',"", ""'chiang',"", ""'mai',"", ""'beach',"", ""'destination',"", ""'doable',"", ""'kid']""]",False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

i would love your input ",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g186217-i16-k13550135-Advice_2_week_trip_to_England_with_a_wedding_in_the_middle-England.html,Advice: 2 week trip to England with a wedding in the middle,Ellie M,0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EllieBMorgan?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,100,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,100,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,100,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,100,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,100,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,50000,"[""['daughter',"", ""'marry',"", ""'england',"", ""'oxfordshire',"", ""'mid',"", ""'july',"", ""'husband',"", ""'19',"", ""'old',"", ""'son',"", ""'arrive',"", ""'stay',"", ""'london',"", ""'5',"", ""'nights',"", ""'st',"", ""'pancras',"", ""'renaissance',"", ""'hotel',"", ""'3',"", ""'nights',"", ""'oxfordshire',"", ""'wed',"", ""'time',"", ""'6',"", ""'nights',"", ""'undecided',"", ""'i’ve',"", ""'little',"", ""'input',"", ""'guy',"", ""'i’m',"", ""'try',"", ""'advice',"", ""'place',"", ""'visit',"", ""'i’ve',"", ""'visit',"", ""'england',"", ""'guy',"", ""'don’t',"", ""'mind',"", ""'touristy',"", ""'events',"", ""'hide',"", ""'treasure',"", ""'quaint',"", ""'locations',"", ""'history',"", ""'stun',"", ""'scenery',"", ""'picturesque',"", ""'villages',"", ""'etci',"", ""'non',"", ""'touristy',"", ""'area',"", ""'secret',"", ""'gems',"", ""'i’m',"", ""'huge',"", ""'fan',"", ""'beatles',"", ""'harry',"", ""'potter',"", ""'daughter',"", ""'future',"", ""'son',"", ""'law',"", ""'horticulturists',"", ""'garden',"", ""'hike',"", ""'enrich',"", ""'experience',"", ""'stay',"", ""'castle',"", ""'beat',"", ""'path',"", ""'suggestions',"", ""'day',"", ""'trip',"", ""'london',"", ""'options',"", ""'2nd',"", ""'leg',"", ""'trip',"", ""'wide',"", ""'open',"", ""'we’ll',"", ""'fly',"", ""'london',"", ""'input']""]",False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

good luck.","i think your biggest problem is choosing end of august, the busiezt time of year and the most expensive. everyone wants this for the same reasons.
on your budget for this time your best bet would be a chain hotel..they'll have lifts too.
or bed and breakfast. have a look outside of towns and away from prime sites like seafronts. you can get some lovely settings.
north wales seems a good point to start. also south
or forgetting the sea and the wye valley is beautiful on the welsh boarders.
use a search site to find vacancies in your price range but don't book with them.find places then go to the hotel site and book directly.
the exception would be booking.com.
check the terms and conditions - you want cancellation in case you get told to isolate or get ill.

i understand the tourist industry is very complicated, having once lived in a 'touristy' area. we needed them because it was pretty much the only way to make a living.
as of yet, we haven't really made any decisions. if we do decide on mull, then i recognise we are going to have to book quite a while ahead, and may still be disappointed. then again, mull isn't going anywhere, and neither are we (we hope), so there will always be another year.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g186584-i1964-k13604751-Visiting_mull_during_time_of_covid-Isle_of_Mull_The_Hebrides_Scotland.html,visiting mull during time of covid,janet a,sheffield england,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/2seniorsontour?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,50,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,200.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,50.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,25000,"[""['head',"", ""'everybody',"", ""'motorhome',"", ""'challenge',"", ""'single',"", ""'lane',"", ""'roads',"", ""'mull',"", ""'fair',"", ""'mull',"", ""'many',"", ""'roads',"", ""'highlands',"", ""'fact',"", ""'many',"", ""'people',"", ""'road',"", ""'motorhome',"", ""'days',"", ""'loan',"", ""'motorhome',"", ""'road',"", ""'trip',"", ""'stay',"", ""'bbs',"", ""'discover',"", ""'world',"", ""'wife',"", ""'stay',"", ""'bb',"", ""'accommodation',"", ""'price',"", ""'outrageous',"", ""'tourist',"", ""'industry',"", ""'complicate',"", ""'live',"", ""'touristy',"", ""'area',"", ""'pretty',"", ""'much',"", ""'way',"", ""'live',"", ""'decisions',"", ""'mull',"", ""'recognise',"", ""'book',"", ""'quite',"", ""'ahead',"", ""'may',"", ""'disappoint',"", ""'mull',"", ""'isnt',"", ""'neither']""]",False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

if you choose to fly cm to lp, an alternative beautiful river trip could be the upper nam ou north of luang prabang. either way after your visit fly to bangkok for a bit, then onto your island getaway.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g293915-i3686-k13496214-Laos_Malaysia_Thailand_for_3_weeks_in_Jan_Feb_2022-Thailand.html,"Laos, Malaysia & Thailand for 3 weeks in Jan/Feb 2022",MrCycling 🚵‍♂️,US,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrCycling?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,200,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,50,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,50,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,25000,"[""['drop',"", ""'malaysia',"", ""'stick',"", ""'thailand',"", ""'laos',"", ""'save',"", ""'malaysia',"", ""'future',"", ""'trip',"", ""'combine',"", ""'se',"", ""'asia',"", ""'destination',"", ""'flight',"", ""'three',"", ""'gateways',"", ""'bangkok',"", ""'phuket',"", ""'chiang',"", ""'mai',"", ""'fly',"", ""'one',"", ""'head',"", ""'chiang',"", ""'mai',"", ""'chiang',"", ""'mai',"", ""'boat',"", ""'chiang',"", ""'khong',"", ""'luang',"", ""'prabang',"", ""'two',"", ""'days',"", ""'mae',"", ""'khong',"", ""'overnight',"", ""'stop',"", ""'pak',"", ""'beng',"", ""'way',"", ""'countryside',"", ""'beautiful',"", ""'river',"", ""'trip',"", ""'boot',"", ""'fly',"", ""'cm',"", ""'lp',"", ""'alternative',"", ""'beautiful',"", ""'river',"", ""'trip',"", ""'upper',"", ""'nam',"", ""'ou',"", ""'north',"", ""'luang',"", ""'prabang',"", ""'way',"", ""'visit',"", ""'fly',"", ""'bangkok',"", ""'onto',"", ""'island',"", ""'getaway']""]",False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

beach passes differ, some include money back of food & beverage others don’t. it depends on how quiet the hotel is. either way i’d always opt for a day pass over hiring beds on the beach. it’s a far more luxurious experience and often works out the same or cheaper cost wise.
i’ve done many a day visit to suss out a hotel to see if it’s a potential one for a future visit
there’s also beach clubs, some have free entry or offers on ladies days but naturally they’re busier. avoid friday & saturday’s as they can be busy and generally charge more for access.
if you look on time out nearer your time of travel it can list offers for beach passes. if not the internet is equally as useful.
