0,555,UK,"interested spending month scotland sure go!
i single 34 year old female, currently working remotely ability anywhere thought nice explore new place. convenience city walkable town (i vehicle, unless inexpensive rental options aware of!) i'd opportunity meet locals age, check surrounding area bit, hang local pub. idea slightly smaller city/town thought people friendlier easier meet people within short period, wrong - want end somewhere sleepy everyone much older filled families.
i love ocean places inland long there's natural beauty, that's deal breaker. mostly want new place new friends.
any suggestions appreciated!","i am interested in spending a month in scotland but not sure where to go!
i am a single 34 year old female, currently working remotely with the ability to be anywhere and thought it would be nice to explore a new place. i like the convenience of a city or a walkable town (i won't have a vehicle, unless there are inexpensive rental options i am not aware of!) i'd like the opportunity to meet some locals around my age, check out the surrounding area a bit, and hang in a local pub. i like the idea of a slightly smaller city/town because i have a thought that people will be friendlier and it would be easier to meet people within a short period, but i may be wrong about that - i don't want to end up somewhere sleepy where everyone is much older than i am or filled with families.
i love being by the ocean but also like places that are inland as long as there's a bit of natural beauty, so that's not a deal breaker. i mostly just want to get to know a new place and make some new friends.

looking at 4-5 nights was looking at 10 hill place would you say this is a good central location.
going to visit the castle any other recommendations. was looking at the forum and a lot of people are saying the loch ness tour is not the best with how long it is and how little time you actually get to see any sites. any recommendations for a good tour that we can spend a day doing and reputable companies to look at.
i've never done a domestic flight before would you allow the same amount of time for arrival to airport as an international flight.
sorry for a lot of questions in one post. its a very late last min holiday.

via subway station akasaka-mitsuke, access subway lines (3 lines serving nearby nagatacho station connected via underground pass) sightseeing spots tokyo within 30 min various directions. downside served jr commuter trains limo bus hnd. that's normally recommend 1st-time visitors.
for me, tokyo monorail (rapid trains) hnd hamamatsucho direct 20 min, change taxi akasaka 15 20 min.
ps. stayed akasaka roughly 10 times business trips 98 2002. subsequent those, stayed 6-8 times personal trips. frequently meet local friends plenty nice local western restaurants, apart nice hotels.",">>akasaka is inconvenient base to do tokyo sightseeing.
i disagree.
via the subway station akasaka-mitsuke, one may access to 5 subway lines (3 lines serving nearby nagatacho station connected via an underground pass) which can take you to most sightseeing spots in tokyo within 30 min in various directions. the downside is that it's not served by any jr commuter trains and limo bus from hnd. that's why i normally don't recommend to 1st-time visitors.
for me, i always take the tokyo monorail (rapid trains) from hnd to hamamatsucho direct in 20 min, then change taxi to akasaka in another 15 to 20 min.
ps. have stayed in akasaka roughly 10 times in my business trips from 98 to 2002. subsequent to those, have stayed there about another 6-8 times on personal trips. i frequently meet my local friends there with plenty of nice local and western restaurants, apart from some nice hotels.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g294232-i525-k13583195-Trains_getting_around_Tokyo_and_Japan_for_12_night_nights-Japan.html,trains getting around Tokyo and Japan for 12 night nights,DLi_hk,US,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DLi_hk?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,50.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,50,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,200,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,200,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,50,0,0,0,0,0,50,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,50000,"[""['akasaka',"", ""'inconvenient',"", ""'base',"", ""'tokyo',"", ""'sightsee',"", ""'disagree',"", ""'via',"", ""'subway',"", ""'station',"", ""'akasaka',"", ""'mitsuke',"", ""'one',"", ""'may',"", ""'access',"", ""'5',"", ""'subway',"", ""'line',"", ""'3',"", ""'line',"", ""'serve',"", ""'nearby',"", ""'nagatacho',"", ""'station',"", ""'connect',"", ""'via',"", ""'underground',"", ""'pass',"", ""'sightsee',"", ""'spot',"", ""'tokyo',"", ""'30',"", ""'min',"", ""'various',"", ""'directions',"", ""'downside',"", ""'serve',"", ""'jr',"", ""'commuter',"", ""'train',"", ""'limo',"", ""'bus',"", ""'hnd',"", ""'normally',"", ""'recommend',"", ""'1st',"", ""'time',"", ""'visitors',"", ""'tokyo',"", ""'monorail',"", ""'rapid',"", ""'train',"", ""'hnd',"", ""'hamamatsucho',"", ""'direct',"", ""'20',"", ""'min',"", ""'taxi',"", ""'akasaka',"", ""'15',"", ""'20',"", ""'min',"", ""'ps',"", ""'stay',"", ""'akasaka',"", ""'roughly',"", ""'10',"", ""'time',"", ""'business',"", ""'trip',"", ""'98',"", ""'2002',"", ""'subsequent',"", ""'stay',"", ""'6',"", ""'8',"", ""'time',"", ""'personal',"", ""'trip',"", ""'frequently',"", ""'meet',"", ""'local',"", ""'friends',"", ""'plenty',"", ""'local',"", ""'western',"", ""'restaurants',"", ""'apart',"", ""'hotels']""]",False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

sorry to say...i also believe it is not possible for foreigners to enter japan this june 2021. but it is not clear on your note. if you are holding a japanese passport or residency pass, then certainly you may enter. but the 14 days quarantine isolation should be part of your plan as global has already mentioned.
again, it is not clear in your note. are you referring to a budget of $110 in us dollar? the currency is in yen. but if in us dollar, that amount will be appropriate for food/restaurant budget for two persons per day. it will not be enough for accommodations and/or transportation. of the three elements, transportation is the most expensive element in japan personally speaking.
do some more research before booking your flight tickets in early june as planned.

ramen is everywhere. most places do a decent enough job. the ones that get very high marks often see long lines--not necessarily worth the effort.
sushi: i agree toyosu is not worth it at all. tsukiji outer market has sushi restaurants as well as other small eats. it's a much more interesting place to wander for 1/2 day. during normal times, it becomes very crowded after 10am so go early if you can. on average, i do find that even the chains around tsukiji serve slightly better quality items than some other places. of course, you can look at reviews and book some of the famous places at other parts of tokyo where quality and the whole experience could be better.
tokyo, osaka and other large cities also have very good places for yakiniku (grilled meat). be sure to try it a couple of times. you don't necessarily have to go for the top wagyu to enjoy the experience.
finally, december is iffy at best to visit at this point. a lot depends on the japanese vaccination rate by then but also whether japan feels foreign country visitors would bring in more cases. don't commit to anything if you can't get a refund.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g294232-i525-k13556687-Researching_for_December_2021_trip-Japan.html,Researching for December 2021 trip,SammyFD,HK,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SammyFD?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,50,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,50,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,50,0,0,200,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,200,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,50,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,50,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,50,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,55000,"[""['fly',"", ""'tokyo',"", ""'order',"", ""'visit',"", ""'face',"", ""'many',"", ""'long',"", ""'train',"", ""'bus',"", ""'rid',"", ""'long',"", ""'flight',"", ""'spend',"", ""'initial',"", ""'days',"", ""'tokyo',"", ""'work',"", ""'way',"", ""'kansai',"", ""'end',"", ""'trip',"", ""'fly',"", ""'osaka',"", ""'home',"", ""'via',"", ""'tokyo',"", ""'airport',"", ""'transit',"", ""'necessary',"", ""'ramen',"", ""'everywhere',"", ""'place',"", ""'decent',"", ""'job',"", ""'ones',"", ""'high',"", ""'mark',"", ""'see',"", ""'long',"", ""'line',"", ""'necessarily',"", ""'worth',"", ""'effort',"", ""'sushi',"", ""'toyosu',"", ""'worth',"", ""'tsukiji',"", ""'outer',"", ""'market',"", ""'sushi',"", ""'restaurants',"", ""'small',"", ""'eat',"", ""'much',"", ""'interest',"", ""'place',"", ""'wander',"", ""'1',"", ""'2',"", ""'day',"", ""'normal',"", ""'time',"", ""'become',"", ""'crowd',"", ""'10am',"", ""'early',"", ""'average',"", ""'chain',"", ""'tsukiji',"", ""'serve',"", ""'slightly',"", ""'quality',"", ""'items',"", ""'place',"", ""'course',"", ""'book',"", ""'famous',"", ""'place',"", ""'part',"", ""'tokyo',"", ""'quality',"", ""'whole',"", ""'experience',"", ""'tokyo',"", ""'osaka',"", ""'large',"", ""'cities',"", ""'good',"", ""'place',"", ""'yakiniku',"", ""'grill',"", ""'meat',"", ""'try',"", ""'couple',"", ""'time',"", ""'necessarily',"", ""'top',"", ""'wagyu',"", ""'experience',"", ""'finally',"", ""'december',"", ""'iffy',"", ""'visit',"", ""'point',"", ""'lot',"", ""'japanese',"", ""'vaccination',"", ""'rate',"", ""'whether',"", ""'japan',"", ""'feel',"", ""'foreign',"", ""'country',"", ""'visitors',"", ""'bring',"", ""'case',"", ""'commit',"", ""'refund']""]",False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,True,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

i am planning a trip to thailand for the month of november 2022, (surely we will be good to go by then right?). i am so excited just thinking about travelling i want to ask your opinion on my plan.
i am 67 and my husband 72. i have been in various countries in south east asia, and in thailand 3 times. my husband has never been.
so this is the plan so far (open to critique, comments and suggestions)
i will have been in bali for the month of october with a friend and then flying to bangkok to meet up with hubby. overnight at the airport hotel
fly to siem reap for four nights. i have been , husband and friend have not. see the temples, ton le sap lake at sunset and a dance show. anyone recommend a good show?
looking for a mid range hotel with a pool walking distance to the market etc if you have a favourite.
from there fly to chaing mai for six nights . again i have been, others have not. we want to go to an elephant sanctuary (any recommendations?) a cooking class and sightsee lots of temples.
perhaps a trip up to chaing rai, (is it worth it? haven’t been) perhaps add another day to overnight there?
the yee peng lantern festival will be happening so thinking of going to the university for the first night to see it, and looking for recommendations for a roof top restaurant /bar for the second night.
any hints on chaing mai would be appreciated. i will want to stay in the old city.
i will also get another thai silk jacket made if i can. i had one made there 15 years ago and it was amazing. i lost too much weight to wear it any more. which is good and bad. anyone recommend a good reasonable tailor who has actual thai silk . i had one made in vietnam a couple years ago but it was a silk polyester blend i think and not the same.
my friend will go home at this point and husband and i will maybe head to khao sok for four nights, thinking of jungle house.
is that too much time, not enough? i read of another place where the cabins are on the water and you can kayak right off them but cant find that. any one know what it is called?
would i want to stay a couple of nights at each place?
will it be really hot, muggy and buggy there in november? my husband does not do well with extreme mugginess and heat.
then the beach!! phi phi for 8 nights to relax, read, swim and snorkel. i stayed at phi phi relax last time, this time though i think i will stay in one of their beachfront cabins so as to avoid all of those stairs.
or open to any other recommendations of similar places. we like to walk out the door and swim in the ocean.
then railay beach for 5 nights . i cant believe how much the prices have gone up since i was there 4 years ago! thinking of railay village resort but open to suggestions. last time we stayed at sand sea but the price has gone up so much.
i am not planning to spend any time in bangkok on purpose.i have been twice before and don’t need to go back other than overnights for flights.
i can add a few more days if you think there is something else that is a must do, close to where we will be so not adding too much travel time
i loved koh samui but from what i have read november is not the best time to travel there.
i look forward to any suggestions from you. this is my favourite part , the planning of it all. i am so excited.
thank you in advance for your expertise and experiences.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g293915-i3686-k13552607-Planning_my_Thailand_trip_for_2022-Thailand.html,Planning my

koh samui airport and the island's only airline are also held in private ownership. the owners maximise their own profits (as expected) and do not maximise the public interest of koh samui.
a significant amount of the hotel, restaurants, bars, nightclubs etc are built for the international tourist markets and not the domestic market. that is simply a function of the market that the islands targeted.
i was on koh samui a couple of months ago and the number 5 star resorts was amazing, but then i thought if the target market was the entire world, then the number of 5 star resorts is not that surprising.
the tourist infrastructure on the islands was designed and built for the international tourist markets and not for local tourist market. that is simply a fact. that is why they are being re-opened to the international tourist markets before the rest of the country. that is why the islands have suffered so much economically.",0,0,0,0,UK,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,50,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,50,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,50.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,200,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,50,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,50,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,32500,"[""['practice',"", ""'locals',"", ""'koh',"", ""'samui',"", ""'phuket',"", ""'large',"", ""'number',"", ""'islands',"", ""'far',"", ""'away',"", ""'drive',"", ""'weekend',"", ""'koh',"", ""'samui',"", ""'airport',"", ""'islands',"", ""'airline',"", ""'hold',"", ""'private',"", ""'ownership',"", ""'owners',"", ""'maximise',"", ""'profit',"", ""'expect',"", ""'maximise',"", ""'public',"", ""'interest',"", ""'koh',"", ""'samui',"", ""'significant',"", ""'amount',"", ""'hotel',"", ""'restaurants',"", ""'bar',"", ""'nightclubs',"", ""'build',"", ""'international',"", ""'tourist',"", ""'market',"", ""'domestic',"", ""'market',"", ""'simply',"", ""'function',"", ""'market',"", ""'islands',"", ""'target',"", ""'koh',"", ""'samui',"", ""'couple',"", ""'months',"", ""'number',"", ""'5',"", ""'star',"", ""'resort',"", ""'amaze',"", ""'target',"", ""'market',"", ""'entire',"", ""'world',"", ""'number',"", ""'5',"", ""'star',"", ""'resort',"", ""'surprise',"", ""'tourist',"", ""'infrastructure',"", ""'islands',"", ""'design',"", ""'build',"", ""'international',"", ""'tourist',"", ""'market',"", ""'local',"", ""'tourist',"", ""'market',"", ""'simply',"", ""'fact',"", ""'open',"", ""'international',"", ""'tourist',"", ""'market',"", ""'rest',"", ""'country',"", ""'islands',"", ""'suffer',"", ""'much',"", ""'economically']""]",False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

think nights gili long. me, ubud deserves longer stay nights (2 full days) plenty see ubud town good base sightseeing cultural sites/experiences afield. could walk campuhan ridge ubud. you’ve stated “replanning” you’ve done research chosen areas. perhaps read pinned posts top forum “the different areas bali.....”.
the weather less wet according crystal ball tell hot humid. june lovely time visit. july/august/september popular time room rates higher busy.
eating bali excellent. many, many cafes/restaurants/local warungs cuisines prices suit budgets.
these comments pre covid.","hi, personally i’d go to ubud first, then gili t, then kuta. kuta being closer to the airport for your departure flight.
why your interest in seminyak? i’m personally not a fan of kuta and prefer seminyak. metered taxis are plentiful and economical for you to visit seminyak from kuta if you want to have a wander around. and my other favourite is sanur. from sanur you can go for a half hour boat trip across to the island of nusa lembongan/nusa penida if you’re interested in water activities (not necessarily diving but maybe snorkelling) and stay for a few days.
think 6 nights on gili t too long. for me, ubud deserves a longer stay than 3 nights (2 full days) as there is plenty to see and do in ubud town and a good base for sightseeing cultural sites/experiences further afield. you could walk the campuhan ridge in ubud. as you’ve stated your “replanning” it would suggest you’ve already done the research of your chosen areas. perhaps have another read of the pinned posts at the top of the forum “the different areas of bali.....”.
the weather will be less wet according to my crystal ball but i can tell you it will be very hot and humid. june is a lovely time to visit. july/august/september is the most popular time but room rates are higher and very busy.
eating out in bali is excellent. many, many cafes/restaurants/local warungs with all cuisines and prices to suit all budgets.

10,2804,IN,"andaman definitely destination. beaches offers lot different things.
lovely, relatively unspoiled, less crowded beaches - north / middle andaman find less people!
some best scuba diving sites india
the gateway middle north andaman - baratang - reaching experience - drive dense tropical forest - tribal reserve (you allowed step vehicle) - chance see jarawa tribal people (hunter,gatherer tribes dont want ‘civilized’ lead blissful life oldest tribes historically)
30 minute boat ride breathtaking mangroves - something see nat geo! trek forest see limestone caves
boat ride creeks watch 100s parrots reach parrot island - night time home
ross & smith islands connected sandbar disappears high tide
turtle nesting sites (during nesting season)
the famous radhanagar beach havelock
watersports havelock, neil, northbay
coral watching jollybuoy / redskin
history: cellular jail british imprisoned tortured indian freedom fighters, japanese bunkers, remnants british rule ross island (this different ross & smith), sound light shows both
i on, highlights. beware - facilities developing top notch - reason relatively unspoiled!
hopefully time travel, london - chennai direct flights resumed connecting flight there. (port blair international airport open soon direct flights!)
depending interests plan. idea
1 full day visiting cellular jail,samudrika marine museum, anthropological museum, chatham saw mill (if interests you) sunset watch trip chidiya tapu
1 full day northbay (sea walking) ross island
1 full day jolly buoy - coral viewing see combine mount harriet trek afternoon
3-4 full nights havelock enjoying beaches, scuba, sea walking, snorkelling etc
2-3 nights neil island
1 day baratang
3-4 nights north andaman - ross & smith, full day saddle peak trek, aam kunj beach etc
there option - much travel - spend week havelock resort radhanagar vijaynagar beaches nights neil islands night arrival night departure port blair town!
ps: reach havelock neil - ferries. baratang, north andaman - travel road. self drive cars available andaman, hire cab driver","andaman is definitely a great destination. it is not just about beaches and offers a lot of different things.
lovely, relatively unspoiled, less crowded beaches - if you go to north / middle andaman you may find even less people!
some of the best scuba diving sites in india
the gateway to middle and north andaman - baratang - reaching here is an experience - drive through dense tropical forest - it is also a tribal reserve (you are not allowed to step out of your vehicle) - chance to see jarawa tribal people (hunter,gatherer tribes who dont want to be ‘civilized’ and probably lead a very blissful life and one of the oldest tribes historically)
30 minute boat ride through breathtaking mangroves - something like what you see in nat geo! then trek through forest to see the limestone caves
boat ride through creeks to watch 100s of parrots reach parrot island - their night time home
ross & smith islands that are connected by a sandbar that disappears during high tide
turtle nesting sites (during the nesting season)
the famous radhanagar beach in havelock
watersports in havelock, neil, northbay
coral watching at jollybuoy / redskin
history: cellular jail where british imprisoned and tortured indian freedom fighters, japanese bunkers, remnants of british rule in ross island (this is different from ross & smith), sound and light shows at both
i can go on, but these are some highlights. but beware - facilities are still developing and may not be top notch - may be the reason why it is relatively unspoiled!
hopefully by the time you travel, london - chennai direct flights would have resumed and take a connecting flight from there. (port blair international airport will open soon and you may even have direct flights!)
depending on your interests you can plan. just to give you an idea
1 full day visiting cellular jail,samudrika marine museum, anthropological museum, chatham saw mill (if that interests you) and a sunset watch trip chidiya tapu
1 full day for northbay (sea walking) and ross island
1 full day for jolly buoy - coral viewing and see if you can combine a mount harriet trek in the afternoon
3-4 full nights in havelock enjoying the beaches, scuba, sea walking, snorkelling etc
2-3 nights in neil island
1 day for baratang
3-4 nights for north andaman - ross & smith, 1 full day for saddle peak trek, aam kunj beach etc
there is another great option - if so much of travel is not for you - spend a week in havelock in a resort either on the radhanagar or vijaynagar beaches and about 5 nights in the neil islands and just the night of arrival and night before departure in port blair town!
ps: to reach havelock and neil - you have to take ferries. for baratang, north andaman - you travel by road. self drive cars are not available in andaman, you have to hire a cab with

i'm currently looking for ideas for our holiday this year, restrictions permitting, of course.
i have to possible weeks when we can visit, due to annual leave approval at work - these are either a week mid august or a week at the beginning of september. which would be best?
second question is regarding where to go... we usually travel a bit further afield but after an amazing holiday in the scottish highlands last year, we've decided to explore closer to home. we would like to spend our holiday enjoying scenic walks, a bit of sightseeing and with good food - plus maybe even a day or two on the beach if the weather is kind. which island would you recommend? or would the scilly isles be a better destination? do you have any particular recommendations? we would love to have access to a pool if possible and don't really want to be self catering.
i have visited guernsey a few times as a teenager and loved it, but the most recent visit was more than 1 5 years ago.
we are planning on driving from cheshire and getting the ferry from southampton (as my partner doesn't fancy flying or going through an airport) but understand we won't really need the car when we get there.
any thoughts much appreciated!
thank you,

my husband drives now when we are there but he does find it stressful at times.
also be mindful if you go anywhere with outdoor parking, getting into a boiling hot car in the summer in dubai that’s been standing a few hours is no fun. touching the seatbelts and steering wheel even less so!!!
i understand your concern re safety as i’m quite paranoid when it comes to covid & germs in general but i think dubai rta has quite stringent measures in place re hygiene. i’m unsure if there’s still a maximum number of passengers allowed, if so then you might need two taxis but if you’re sitting in the back with a face mask on and sanitising your hands after touching seat belts, doors etc i think you’d feel okay but it’s obviously a personal choice.
in all honesty if & when i get to travel anywhere this year i plan to do little in terms of sightseeing and avoid crowds, transport as much as i can but there’s the obvious hurdle of the flight & airport...

i am currently planning my future (hopefully 2022) trip to vietnam, and i was extremely impressed by the beauty of the rural areas.
i am a photographer, so mind that any trip i do is aimed towards that, just as much as having an authentic experience.
i laid out two itineraries, one in april and one in september, as they seem like great months overall for the whole country, weather wise.
my april itinerary looks like this:
31st march, arrival in ho chi minh city, spend two nights there.
2nd april, flight to hue for the hue festival, stay two nights.
4th april, train/whatever from hue to ninh binh, stay three nights.
8th april, mai chau by motorbike from ninh bing, one night.
9th april, pu luong by motorbike, day trip or one night.
then back to ninh binh and back to hanoi.
now that i took out a bit of stuff, i'd love to add something after this, but i'm not sure where to go in april. you reckon the mu cang chai or ha guang's areas would work anyway?
i'm also absolutely willing to expand my stay in specific places if you think it's worth it.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g293921-i8432-k13495331-April_Itinerary-Vietnam.html,April Itinerary,Luca,0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LucaOnAdventure?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,200,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,50,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,50,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,50,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,50,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,30000,"[""['hello',"", ""'divide',"", ""'two',"", ""'itineraries',"", ""'two',"", ""'thread',"", ""'help',"", ""'stuff',"", ""'recommend',"", ""'plan',"", ""'future',"", ""'2022',"", ""'trip',"", ""'vietnam',"", ""'extremely',"", ""'impress',"", ""'beauty',"", ""'rural',"", ""'areas',"", ""'photographer',"", ""'mind',"", ""'trip',"", ""'aim',"", ""'much',"", ""'authentic',"", ""'experience',"", ""'lay',"", ""'two',"", ""'itineraries',"", ""'one',"", ""'april',"", ""'one',"", ""'september',"", ""'months',"", ""'overall',"", ""'whole',"", ""'country',"", ""'weather',"", ""'wise',"", ""'april',"", ""'itinerary',"", ""'31st',"", ""'march',"", ""'arrival',"", ""'ho',"", ""'chi',"", ""'minh',"", ""'city',"", ""'spend',"", ""'two',"", ""'nights',"", ""'2nd',"", ""'april',"", ""'flight',"", ""'hue',"", ""'hue',"", ""'festival',"", ""'stay',"", ""'two',"", ""'nights',"", ""'4th',"", ""'april',"", ""'train',"", ""'whatever',"", ""'hue',"", ""'ninh',"", ""'binh',"", ""'stay',"", ""'three',"", ""'nights',"", ""'8th',"", ""'april',"", ""'mai',"", ""'chau',"", ""'motorbike',"", ""'ninh',"", ""'bing',"", ""'one',"", ""'night',"", ""'9th',"", ""'april',"", ""'pu',"", ""'luong',"", ""'motorbike',"", ""'day',"", ""'trip',"", ""'one',"", ""'night',"", ""'ninh',"", ""'binh',"", ""'hanoi',"", ""'stuff',"", ""'add',"", ""'something',"", ""'april',"", ""'reckon',"", ""'mu',"", ""'cang',"", ""'chai',"", ""'ha',"", ""'guangs',"", ""'areas',"", ""'work',"", ""'expand',"", ""'stay',"", ""'specific',"", ""'place',"", ""'worth']""]",False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

i'm sorry.. clearer original post. intent options tokyo kyoto:
1. flying haneda sapporo 12/28 flying sapporo kansai 12/30 minimize long crowded train trips. flying better?
2. taking train mie prefecture see nabana sato park illuminations.
3. taking train nagano, shirakawago snow. trains crowded going nagano kyoto coming tokyo?
4. going hiroshima/miyajima. unique fly hiroshima haneda fly kansai.
i trying change flight going tokyo looking good! definitely change hotels disney portion closer tokyo station shinjuku. read going disney christmas crowded research that.
thank suggestions!","thank you everyone for your input.
i'm sorry.. i should have been clearer in my original post. my intent is to do only 1 out of the 4 options between tokyo and kyoto:
1. flying from haneda to sapporo on 12/28 then flying from sapporo to kansai on 12/30 to minimize long crowded train trips. is flying really any better?
2. taking the train to mie prefecture to see nabana no sato park illuminations.
3. taking the train to nagano, shirakawago for snow. are the trains just as crowded going from nagano to kyoto as they would be coming from tokyo?
4. going to hiroshima/miyajima. not really unique but we can fly to hiroshima from haneda then fly into kansai.
i am trying to change the flight to one going to tokyo but it's not looking good! i would definitely change hotels after the disney portion to closer to tokyo station or shinjuku. i read that going to disney after christmas is very crowded but i will do more research on that.

jaap","hello
i was thinking of planning a trip to indonesia for 3 weeks from late august to the middle of september.
i know the question regarding possible travel concidering covid is a hard one for anyone to answer so i'm not asking that one.
my idea was to book a flight with a cancellation ensurance as there are cheap flights at the moment. and wait untill the situation is more clear. then i will either cancel or plan the rest of my trip.
so my actual question is: is it easy to book accomodation and tours only a week or 2 before or even on the spot?
pottential plans i have (the plans will form with the answer i hope to gain here):
- land in jakarta and go to bali with train/driver with some stops (i would like to try this in about 5 days) (additional question: are trains easy to use in indonesia?)
- few days in bali
- lombok (hike to the top of the vulcano and diving) this is the one i really want to do

these “green zones” mooted exactly work unknown.
our trips bali include amed often include places gilis, nusa lembongan pemuteran. ubud somewhere “down south” flying home.
we mainly diving, snorkeling chillaxing.
we trip november 2020 ubud - amed - gili - nusa lembongan - sanur (before flying perth/rottnes island). obviously cancelled.

however bali open international tourists nobody knows open, entry criteria (whether -ve test and/or covid vaccine and/or quarantine) allowed stay.
you account flight transit countries. bali opens possible transit countries allow transit (as happened singapore last year banned many countries transit).
the irony china countries sort “travel corridor” agreement indonesia.","hi,
these “green zones” have only been mooted and exactly how they will work is unknown.
our trips to bali always include amed then often include places like gilis, nusa lembongan or pemuteran. sometimes ubud and somewhere “down south” before flying home.
we mainly go for diving, snorkeling and chillaxing.
we had a trip for november 2020 which was ubud - amed - gili t - nusa lembongan - sanur (before flying to perth/rottnes island). obviously cancelled.
our next trip, whenever, hopefully will be as above but without oz.
we will not go to bali (when allowed) if we are restricted to places we have little or no interest in staying.
however bali is not open to international tourists and nobody knows when it will be open, who will be first or entry criteria (whether -ve test and/or covid vaccine and/or quarantine) or where you will be allowed to stay.
you also have to take into account all your flight transit countries. even if bali opens it is possible your transit countries may not allow you in even for transit (as happened with singapore last year who banned many countries even from transit).
the irony is that china may be one of the first countries to have some sort of “travel corridor” agreement with indonesia.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g294226-i7220-k13510952-4_weeks_in_Bali_and_Gili_Air_August_September_2021-Bali.html,4 weeks in Bali and Gili Air August/ September 2021,NotaPigsty,DE,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NotaPigsty?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,100,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,100,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,100,0,100,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,100,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,100.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,100,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,100,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,80000,"[""['“green',"", ""'zones”',"", ""'moot',"", ""'exactly',"", ""'work',"", ""'unknown',"", ""'trip',"", ""'bali',"", ""'include',"", ""'amed',"", ""'include',"", ""'place',"", ""'gilis',"", ""'nusa',"", ""'lembongan',"", ""'pemuteran',"", ""'ubud',"", ""'“down',"", ""'south”',"", ""'fly',"", ""'home',"", ""'mainly',"", ""'dive',"", ""'snorkel',"", ""'chillaxing',"", ""'trip',"", ""'november',"", ""'2020',"", ""'ubud',"", ""'amed',"", ""'gili',"", ""'nusa',"", ""'lembongan',"", ""'sanur',"", ""'fly',"", ""'perth',"", ""'rottnes',"", ""'island',"", ""'obviously',"", ""'cancel',"", ""'trip',"", ""'whenever',"", ""'oz',"", ""'bali',"", ""'allow',"", ""'restrict',"", ""'place',"", ""'little',"", ""'interest',"", ""'stay',"", ""'bali',"", ""'open',"", ""'international',"", ""'tourists',"", ""'nobody',"", ""'open',"", ""'entry',"", ""'criteria',"", ""'whether',"", ""'test',"", ""'covid',"", ""'vaccine',"", ""'quarantine',"", ""'allow',"", ""'stay',"", ""'account',"", ""'flight',"", ""'transit',"", ""'countries',"", ""'bali',"", ""'open',"", ""'transit',"", ""'countries',"", ""'may',"", ""'allow',"", ""'transit',"", ""'happen',"", ""'singapore',"", ""'ban',"", ""'many',"", ""'countries',"", ""'transit',"", ""'irony',"", ""'china',"", ""'may',"", ""'one',"", ""'countries',"", ""'sort',"", ""'“travel',"", ""'corridor”',"", ""'agreement',"", ""'indonesia']""]",False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

thanks much.","the problem is......you want to see it all. but not at the expense of being too busy that you cant enjoy it.
this is the plan for the first part. i am wondering if we should maybe try to carve one more night in here. we are two women in our late sixties for this first part. my husband joins us half way through.
we are arriving from canada, october 2022, but having an overnight in bangkok to break up the trip. we should arrive on bali around 5pm
we would then transfer directly to amed for two nights to just relax, snorkel and swim
then to gili trawangan for two nights, again the focus on snorkelling and relaxing
back for one night to amed. the thought here is to leave our luggage at the hotel in amed and just take a couple things to gili with us, so figured we would have to book another night at the hotel to do this. ( or any other ideas)?
then onto tulamben for two nights
then to ubud for a longer stay.
after ubud we will go south and thinking of candidasa 5 nights and then benoa for our last four nights to be close to the airport to fly back to bangkok
we have a month in total, but really wondering about this first part. is it too rushed?
should we add another night somewhere?

thanks help!","hello! we jumped on one of the cheap tokyo flight deals for november with the expectation that we will likely have to push the trip further out... but in the meantime, i love researching and planning trips, and here i am digging through tripadvisor again!
we did an amazing 2 weeks in japan in november 2019 and covered all of the major first-timer places: tokyo, kamakura/enoshima, kyoto, nara, osaka, himeji, hiroshima/miyajima, fukuoka (sumo tournament/nanzoin buddha). disneysea.
now i'm looking for advice on what to do for a second trip! we love doing a bit of everything - covering the most famous stuff, pretty temples/gardens (especially if we are there for fall leaves) again, easy hikes, eating, and just wandering. my husband does japanese calligraphy as a hobby, so we're also looking for museums/classes/shops for his interests.
we are planning to do hakone/mt. fuji area and a few days around kyoto/osaka because there is so much to see and do there (i really want to do the aquarium!). and in my research, i've recently discovered the ""diamond route"" term for fukushima, ibaraki, and tochigi prefectures. since nikko is definitely a place i want to go this time, i was wondering if the other locations are worth spending 3-4 days exploring, something like: tokyo > mito > koriyama > urabandai > aizu-wakamatsu > ouchijuku > nikko > utsunomiya > tokyo?
we would do this ourselves on trains/buses, not through a tour company, but here are example itineraries to illustrate what i'm thinking: 
so any other advice for our second trip itinerary?
days 1-2 tokyo
3-7 diamond route? or just a nikko day trip and then go somewhere else?
8-11 kyoto/osaka - other day trips besides nara to do?
12-14 hakone/mt. fuji
15 tokyo and return flight

rayza","ten days is not too long. you list 10 nights in the three cities, but if you are travelling from and back to hcmc on days and 10, isn't that only 9 nights?
i suggest flying to hue and back from danang (or vice versa) to have one less 'moving day', checking in and out of accommodation - unless you already plan to go by rail one way and road the other between danang and hue.
in hue, the imperial citadel is worth a visit and with no large international tour groups around you shouldn't find it crowded. cycling is easy around the citadel and between there and thien mu pagoda in the leafy streets and garden houses of kim long. it is cooler there than the citadel and central area of the city. you can find good local food and cafes in both areas.
outside the city, distances make a motorcycle or car a better choice. it will also be very very hot in july.
some suggestions:
huyen tran princess temple. i've never seen many there. past the top building to the left are stone steps to the peace bell and good views worth the climb.
dong khanh and gia long tombs receive fewer visitors than the three tombs on most itineraries. they are all worth a visit but two or three is enough for most on one day.
thanh toan bridge, which has recently undergone restoration work, is 7km out of town through vast rice paddies. it is right beside a small market and a small rice growing museum is nearby. a relaxing place.
thuan an beach will be busy before 9 am and after 4pm and quiet in between. along the way from the city i like to stop at cho no, a riverside market. futher on you could detour a little to chuon lagoon. if you want to venture south from there - over 25km more - you'll find an bang aka city of ghosts with its hundreds of extravagant ornate tombs. there is a shorter route back via phu bai.
if you aren't renting a motorbike, a motorbike tour rider or private car driver will take to to places you request, but i can't recommend any at the moment. all the riders i've used have found new jobs. the drivers i've used were sole operators and some have had to sell their cars. others decided not to continue to register it as a business car carrying the new yellow plates. maybe they will return sometime. meanwhile, they too have other work. your hotel will probably know who is available.

",">>the layover can be from 12 to 15 hours involving an overnight stay<<
so first off the layover structure. you will be able to buy separate tickets in and out, but you won' be able to fly them at the moment. as such, you need an airside transit only option - so a single ticket on one of the permitted airlines/airline pairings.
>>can someone share info if there is hotel open during the covid-19 pandemic. if not, what airport facilities within the air side can help getting some reasonable sleep also getting some meals, may be a shower?<<
there are two of the airside transit hotels open at the moment.
you dont mention where you are flying from and that has the potential to be important. if you are flying in from most locations then you get escorted to the hotel for the stay and then shuffled to a transit holding area. from there you can order food on an app, use vending machines but otherwise you are sat in a fixed, potentially crowded area.
if you are coming from australia, new zealand, brunei or mainland china then you have more freedom and there are more things open and accessible.
this thread discussed what it is like for those allowed to wander a bit more due to their point of origin

australians can enter singapore visa free, could you not solve a lot of the problems by entering and leaving singapore on the australian passport. the details you fill in on the singapore landing card don't have to match what you leave indonesia with (it wont for many dual nationals). that means you never present two passports anywhere.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g294262-i1747-k13623949-Dual_passport-Singapore.html,Dual passport,Myrm,UK,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/myrm?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,100,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,100,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,100,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,30000,"[""['presume',"", ""'bounce',"", ""'singapore',"", ""'avoid',"", ""'flight',"", ""'australia',"", ""'present',"", ""'passports',"", ""'indonesian',"", ""'officials',"", ""'thus',"", ""'cause',"", ""'problems',"", ""'jealous',"", ""'passport',"", ""'young',"", ""'allow',"", ""'dual',"", ""'passports',"", ""'indonesia',"", ""'latter',"", ""'describe',"", ""'step',"", ""'enter',"", ""'singapore',"", ""'aus',"", ""'passport',"", ""'detail',"", ""'rare',"", ""'spot',"", ""'intervene',"", ""'upon',"", ""'countries',"", ""'tend',"", ""'police',"", ""'sort',"", ""'present',"", ""'passports',"", ""'gate',"", ""'agent',"", ""'notionally',"", ""'legitimately',"", ""'refuse',"", ""'accept',"", ""'valid',"", ""'require',"", ""'pick',"", ""'one',"", ""'determine',"", ""'travel',"", ""'low',"", ""'likelihood',"", ""'theoretical',"", ""'risk',"", ""'australians',"", ""'enter',"", ""'singapore',"", ""'visa',"", ""'free',"", ""'solve',"", ""'lot',"", ""'problems',"", ""'enter',"", ""'singapore',"", ""'australian',"", ""'passport',"", ""'detail',"", ""'fill',"", ""'singapore',"", ""'land',"", ""'card',"", ""'match',"", ""'indonesia',"", ""'many',"", ""'dual',"", ""'nationals',"", ""'present',"", ""'two',"", ""'passports']""]",False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

however, you need to have a routing that doesn't allow through tickets or have pulled a huge deal on the separate flights (eg two lccs) for it to not be worth having a through flight as with disconnected flights you take all risks and losses of non-connects on yourself.

you answers likely destinations posters something about.
so acting hub thing.
yes singapore ideal fly countries using multicity ticket inbound airline (easier sia codeshare theirs) several low cost carrier options. said lcc network decent enough able move malaysia indonesian locations direct well. lccs sure return singapore intercontinental flight gives plenty time spare flight options wrong. point separate tickets late lcc flight means burn return cases.
your current plan exactly disliked india trip. wil spend time travelling travel related activities (packing, unpacking, transfers, waiting airports, waiting checkin times etc). want see places need narrow down.
train singapore kl - isnt direct train anymore. break up. decent guide seat61 fairly date  note four trains involved - mrt woodlands, cross border shuttle, train north change kl.
however let stop penang - listed destinations. could butterworth ferry penang stop (and includes georgetown obviously). direct flights want see penang vs complex journey. penang ipoh two places list pull (though ive tested penang see met expectation did, albeit brief stop).
another idea/alteration throw consideration. indonesian island bintan 45minute ferry ride singapore. decent range hotels plus option see something island want, pick right place 'beach resort' days. much easier cheaper many flights.
also address elephant room, singapore forum - allocate time singapore - density amount place offer significant decision much time give.
i need narrow list decent time layout - details forums relevant destination planned.","so given you are using singapore as a hub and nothing else, the questions are best asked in the malaysian and indonesian forums.
you will get some answers here as these are likely destinations some posters here will know something about.
so for the acting as a hub thing.
yes singapore is ideal for this to fly into and out to the other countries using either a multicity ticket from your inbound airline (easier if its sia or a codeshare of theirs) or one of several low cost carrier options. that said the lcc network is decent enough to be able to move between malaysia and indonesian locations direct as well. if you make use of lccs make very very sure that your return to singapore for the intercontinental flight gives you plenty of time and spare flight options if things go wrong. at that point they will very probably be separate tickets and a late lcc flight means you burn your return in most cases.
your current plan does exactly what you disliked about your india trip. you wil spend most of the time travelling or in travel related activities (packing, unpacking, transfers, waiting in airports, waiting on checkin times etc). if you want to see these places then you need to narrow things down.
train for singapore to kl - there isnt a direct train anymore. so you have to break things up. there is a decent guide by seat61 here that should be fairly up to date  however note that there are four trains involved - mrt to woodlands, cross border shuttle, one train north and a change to get to kl.
however that does let you stop in penang - one of your listed destinations. so you could use that to get off at butterworth and ferry to penang for one stop (and that includes georgetown obviously). there are however direct flights if you want to see penang more vs the complex journey. penang and ipoh are the two places on your list that would pull me in (though ive only tested penang to see if it met expectation and it did, albeit for a brief stop).
another idea/alteration to throw into consideration. the indonesian island of bintan is a 45minute ferry ride from singapore. decent range of hotels plus the option to see something of the island if you want, but you can also pick the right place and just do 'beach resort' for a few days. much easier and cheaper than many flights.
also and to address the elephant in the room, since this is the singapore forum - why not allocate any time in singapore - although the density and amount the place has to offer you have to make a significant decision on how much time to give.
i think you first need to narrow down the list to get a decent time layout first - then get details from the forums relevant to the destination planned.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g294265-i1748-k13623295-Malaysia_Indonesia_Itinerary-Singapore.html,Malaysia/Indonesia Itinerary,Myrm,UK,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/myrm?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,50,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,200,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,200,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,50,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,45000,"[""['singapore',"", ""'hub',"", ""'question',"", ""'malaysian',"", ""'indonesian',"", ""'forums',"", ""'destinations',"", ""'posters',"", ""'something',"", ""'act',"", ""'hub',"", ""'singapore',"", ""'ideal',"", ""'fly',"", ""'countries',"", ""'multicity',"", ""'ticket',"", ""'inbound',"", ""'airline',"", ""'easier',"", ""'sia',"", ""'codeshare',"", ""'one',"", ""'low',"", ""'cost',"", ""'carrier',"", ""'options',"", ""'lcc',"", ""'network',"", ""'decent',"", ""'able',"", ""'move',"", ""'malaysia',"", ""'indonesian',"", ""'locations',"", ""'direct',"", ""'lccs',"", ""'singapore',"", ""'intercontinental',"", ""'flight',"", ""'plenty',"", ""'time',"", ""'spare',"", ""'flight',"", ""'options',"", ""'wrong',"", ""'point',"", ""'separate',"", ""'ticket',"", ""'late',"", ""'lcc',"", ""'flight',"", ""'burn',"", ""'case',"", ""'current',"", ""'plan',"", ""'exactly',"", ""'dislike',"", ""'india',"", ""'trip',"", ""'wil',"", ""'spend',"", ""'time',"", ""'travel',"", ""'travel',"", ""'relate',"", ""'activities',"", ""'pack',"", ""'unpack',"", ""'transfer',"", ""'wait',"", ""'airports',"", ""'wait',"", ""'checkin',"", ""'time',"", ""'see',"", ""'place',"", ""'narrow',"", ""'train',"", ""'singapore',"", ""'kl',"", ""'isnt',"", ""'direct',"", ""'train',"", ""'anymore',"", ""'break',"", ""'decent',"", ""'guide',"", ""'seat61',"", ""'fairly',"", ""'date',"", ""'note',"", ""'four',"", ""'train',"", ""'involve',"", ""'mrt',"", ""'woodlands',"", ""'cross',"", ""'border',"", ""'shuttle',"", ""'one',"", ""'train',"", ""'north',"", ""'kl',"", ""'stop',"", ""'penang',"", ""'one',"", ""'destinations',"", ""'butterworth',"", ""'ferry',"", ""'penang',"", ""'one',"", ""'stop',"", ""'include',"", ""'georgetown',"", ""'obviously',"", ""'direct',"", ""'flight',"", ""'see',"", ""'penang',"", ""'vs',"", ""'complex',"", ""'journey',"", ""'penang',"", ""'ipoh',"", ""'two',"", ""'place',"", ""'pull',"", ""'test',"", ""'penang',"", ""'see',"", ""'meet',"", ""'expectation',"", ""'albeit',"", ""'brief',"", ""'stop',"", ""'idea',"", ""'alteration',"", ""'throw',"", ""'consideration',"", ""'indonesian',"", ""'island',"", ""'bintan',"", ""'45minute',"", ""'ferry',"", ""'ride',"", ""'singapore',"", ""'decent',"", ""'range',"", ""'hotels',"", ""'plus',"", ""'see',"", ""'something',"", ""'island',"", ""'pick',"", ""'right',"", ""'place',"", ""'beach',"", ""'resort',"", ""'days',"", ""'much',"", ""'easier',"", ""'cheaper',"", ""'many',"", ""'flight',"", ""'address',"", ""'elephant',"", ""'room',"", ""'singapore',"", ""'forum',"", ""'allocate',"", ""'time',"", ""'singapore',"", ""'density',"", ""'amount',"", ""'place',"", ""'significant',"", ""'decision',"", ""'much',"", ""'time',"", ""'narrow',"", ""'decent',"", ""'time',"", ""'layout',"", ""'detail',"", ""'forums',"", ""'relevant',"", ""'destination',"", ""'plan']""]",False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

1) nobody can obtain a transit visa. singapore doesnt operate such a visa. a few indians may qualify for the vftf (visa-free transit facility). that allows 96hr visa free access to singapore, if you are in transit to a third country and have a visa from one of 8 countries (uk, nz, aus, us, canada, japan, switzerland and germany from memory). however, you dont mention anything like that so in that case you require a standard visit visa.
2) the 2.5 hour tour requires you to go through immigration and you have to have entry permission to use it. that tour is basic and you can do better on your own given you have much more time.

be aware online travel bookers appear offer cheap prices mat appear cheap making separate tickets multicity single ticket could cause yo problems accept offer critique","visas are for entry to a country. they sometimes are limited to particular ports of entry in the country you are trying to come into but they do not care how you get there. the visas are tied to a passport and a person not a location.
for the flight from singapore to seoul you would show the visa for south korea to prove you have right to request entry. the india to singapore leg is irrelevant at that point. for that first leg, because you have a return ticket then that should be all that concerns them if you buy separate tickets.
however, for these flights do think carefully about making it separate tickets. if you buy two return tickets (one india to singapore, the second singapore to south korea) it raise a number of issues.
firstly you will need a multiple entry visa to singapore as the separate tickets give you no guarantee of airside transfer on the return flight set. you are expected to need and so be able to pass immigration in singapore again. so when you apply for the singapore visa you need to include that layover in the travel plans no matter how brief.
second, you cannot do the normal few hours time gap between flights on the return. those timings assume single tickets which offer protected connections. you need to leave significantly longer between flight to allow for delays and rescheduling and similar. if you arrive in singapore from south korea and have a separate flight out but are delayed so you miss it then neither airline has to do anything for you. you will have to rebook the flight to india. while you can possibly recover some value from the original ticket if it had any flexibility you may lose all value given ticket t&cs these day and the tendency to for non-refundable tickets to be bought.
you can make this one ticket by using a multicity ticket from one airline or airline partner set....so you have one leg india to singapore, stop for two days, then on to south korea but then have the return as a single through journey from korea to india via singapore. that provides you a protected connection on the way home, allowing for a shorter stopover at that point and to remain airside meaning no need to sort a multiple entry visa and fewer problems in the event of delays.
be aware that the online travel bookers who appear to offer the cheap prices mat make this appear cheap by making it separate tickets not a multicity single ticket which could cause yo u problems if you accept their offer without critique",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g294262-i1747-k13578009-India_to_Seoul_via_Singapore-Singapore.html,India to Seoul via Singapore,Myrm,UK,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/myrm?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,80,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,500,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,320,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,78800,"[""['visa',"", ""'entry',"", ""'country',"", ""'limit',"", ""'particular',"", ""'port',"", ""'entry',"", ""'country',"", ""'try',"", ""'care',"", ""'visa',"", ""'tie',"", ""'passport',"", ""'person',"", ""'location',"", ""'flight',"", ""'singapore',"", ""'seoul',"", ""'show',"", ""'visa',"", ""'south',"", ""'korea',"", ""'prove',"", ""'right',"", ""'request',"", ""'entry',"", ""'india',"", ""'singapore',"", ""'leg',"", ""'irrelevant',"", ""'point',"", ""'leg',"", ""'ticket',"", ""'concern',"", ""'buy',"", ""'separate',"", ""'ticket',"", ""'flight',"", ""'carefully',"", ""'separate',"", ""'ticket',"", ""'buy',"", ""'two',"", ""'ticket',"", ""'one',"", ""'india',"", ""'singapore',"", ""'second',"", ""'singapore',"", ""'south',"", ""'korea',"", ""'raise',"", ""'number',"", ""'firstly',"", ""'multiple',"", ""'entry',"", ""'visa',"", ""'singapore',"", ""'separate',"", ""'ticket',"", ""'guarantee',"", ""'airside',"", ""'transfer',"", ""'flight',"", ""'set',"", ""'expect',"", ""'able',"", ""'pass',"", ""'immigration',"", ""'singapore',"", ""'singapore',"", ""'visa',"", ""'include',"", ""'layover',"", ""'travel',"", ""'plan',"", ""'matter',"", ""'brief',"", ""'second',"", ""'cannot',"", ""'normal',"", ""'hours',"", ""'time',"", ""'gap',"", ""'flight',"", ""'time',"", ""'assume',"", ""'single',"", ""'ticket',"", ""'protect',"", ""'connections',"", ""'significantly',"", ""'longer',"", ""'flight',"", ""'allow',"", ""'delay',"", ""'reschedule',"", ""'similar',"", ""'arrive',"", ""'singapore',"", ""'south',"", ""'korea',"", ""'separate',"", ""'flight',"", ""'delay',"", ""'miss',"", ""'neither',"", ""'airline',"", ""'rebook',"", ""'flight',"", ""'india',"", ""'possibly',"", ""'recover',"", ""'value',"", ""'original',"", ""'ticket',"", ""'flexibility',"", ""'may',"", ""'lose',"", ""'value',"", ""'ticket',"", ""'tcs',"", ""'day',"", ""'tendency',"", ""'non',"", ""'refundable',"", ""'ticket',"", ""'buy',"", ""'one',"", ""'ticket',"", ""'multicity',"", ""'ticket',"", ""'one',"", ""'airline',"", ""'airline',"", ""'partner',"", ""'setso',"", ""'one',"", ""'leg',"", ""'india',"", ""'singapore',"", ""'stop',"", ""'two',"", ""'days',"", ""'south',"", ""'korea',"", ""'single',"", ""'journey',"", ""'korea',"", ""'india',"", ""'via',"", ""'singapore',"", ""'provide',"", ""'protect',"", ""'connection',"", ""'way',"", ""'home',"", ""'allow',"", ""'shorter',"", ""'stopover',"", ""'point',"", ""'remain',"", ""'airside',"", ""'sort',"", ""'multiple',"", ""'entry',"", ""'visa',"", ""'fewer',"", ""'problems',"", ""'event',"", ""'delay',"", ""'aware',"", ""'online',"", ""'travel',"", ""'bookers',"", ""'appear',"", ""'cheap',"", ""'price',"", ""'mat',"", ""'appear',"", ""'cheap',"", ""'separate',"", ""'ticket',"", ""'multicity',"", ""'single',"", ""'ticket',"", ""'cause',"", ""'yo',"", ""'problems',"", ""'accept',"", ""'critique']""]",False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

sorry but you seem to have fallen into the common misunderstanding about the green list system. it solely represents what uk/england border staff will make you do if you show up from one of the territories or countries on the list. it has no effect on the other places' rules when they are independant countries.
i can almost guarantee that won't be going to singapore in june because they are currently totally closed to people who have been in the uk. there are only about 3 or 4 places they will accept tourists from at the moment. a few more places on preapproved business travel who are kept somewhat in isolation. the rate of change likely means in a month and a halfs time the chances of them having opened to uk origin travellers are negligible i'm sorry to say.
for future reference singapore is easy to get around and tour groups for english speakers are essentially unnecessary. all the regulars here will diy. there are some walking tours that add value from the guide and maybe duck tours and similar. however the core easy to just get hotel and flights and arrive and go yourself.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g294262-i1747-k13543281-Possibly_might_travel_alone_to_Singapore_need_help_please-Singapore.html,"Possibly might travel alone to Singapore, need help please",Myrm,UK,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/myrm?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,100,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,100,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,100,0,0,0,0,0,100,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,40000,"[""['today',"", ""'singapore',"", ""'green',"", ""'englanf',"", ""'discussions',"", ""'friends',"", ""'intend',"", ""'book',"", ""'week',"", ""'june',"", ""'june',"", ""'14th',"", ""'7',"", ""'days',"", ""'sorry',"", ""'fall',"", ""'common',"", ""'misunderstand',"", ""'green',"", ""'system',"", ""'solely',"", ""'represent',"", ""'uk',"", ""'england',"", ""'border',"", ""'staff',"", ""'show',"", ""'one',"", ""'territories',"", ""'countries',"", ""'effect',"", ""'place',"", ""'rule',"", ""'independant',"", ""'countries',"", ""'guarantee',"", ""'singapore',"", ""'june',"", ""'totally',"", ""'close',"", ""'people',"", ""'uk',"", ""'3',"", ""'4',"", ""'place',"", ""'accept',"", ""'tourists',"", ""'moment',"", ""'place',"", ""'preapproved',"", ""'business',"", ""'travel',"", ""'keep',"", ""'somewhat',"", ""'isolation',"", ""'rate',"", ""'month',"", ""'halfs',"", ""'time',"", ""'open',"", ""'uk',"", ""'origin',"", ""'travellers',"", ""'negligible',"", ""'sorry',"", ""'future',"", ""'reference',"", ""'singapore',"", ""'easy',"", ""'tour',"", ""'group',"", ""'english',"", ""'speakers',"", ""'essentially',"", ""'unnecessary',"", ""'regulars',"", ""'diy',"", ""'walk',"", ""'tour',"", ""'add',"", ""'value',"", ""'guide',"", ""'duck',"", ""'tour',"", ""'similar',"", ""'core',"", ""'easy',"", ""'hotel',"", ""'flight',"", ""'arrive']""]",False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

edited: 10:36 am, april 21,","i cannot stress this enough, uk pages for entry to singapore are not authoritative for that information. good general information, sure, but not for details and the devil is in the detail here. the comments and description there do not really give a fair reflection on the scope of the changes a couple of weeks ago. the gov.uk page makes it look like anyone can visit short term with permission and thats not a real reflection of reality. if its a change today on the gov/uk website then its running behind when this was changed by singapore near the start of the month.
the singapore ica is the source for this and their page is here

the sole change that has occured recently is that the uk and south africa are now permitted to apply for entry for business and official travel when they were the only two countries excluded. thats not a big change, because we are talking government officials and very very big business - so very small numbers and they are kept in a bubble.
as such, id suggest its not our improving virological profile thats done it. it the fact that the two variants of concern that were first identified in those to countries that led to their exclusion, are now global so there is no reason to exclude the uk and za from that very controlled and restricted business/official box. the requirements there paint a very different picture im afraid.
improvements in our virological profile will only be seen to have an effect once the general traveller is considered by singapore. yes it will happen but not for this change.

i'll be flying from brisbane to bangkok, with an 11 hour transit at changi (was originally only going to be 4 hrs, but alas, flight times got changed and now have a much longer time frame at the airport).
since i'm flying from australia, i won't need to go to the transit holding area, and will be free to roam the terminals airside, so i'm just wondering if anyone has transited lately, and what it was like in the terminals?
was there many duty free and other shops open?
i'm guessing a lot of the attractions may be closed, so just getting myself ready for a rather long and boring transit.

i'm currently in changi airport after my flight from brisbane.
due to flying from australia i am allowed to roam freely thru the terminal, and have found that around 60% of shops and food outlets are open.
as mentioned above, the butterfly garden is closed, but the cactus garden is still open.
for those that smoke, all the smoking areas are still open.
i've seen the monorail system zipping between the terminals but strangely enough when going to the station is says it's not operating at the moment, so i'm either at the wrong station or they are just doing test runs.
the bigger duty free shops are open, but with reduced times, with the cosmetic duty free opening earlier then the alcohol and tobacco duty free shops.
i'm writing this from the krisflyer lounge , after upgrading my singapore to bangkok flight on singapore airways to business class on an bid for upgrade offer. mainly did it for the lounge access as i have an 11hr transit and the bid i put in was actually cheaper then it would have cost for a transit hotel room.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g294262-i1747-k13500396-Transit_Changi_what_s_it_like-Singapore.html,"Transit Changi, what's it like?",Psyvolt,0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Psyvolt?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,200,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,50,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,50,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,50,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,50,50,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,50,0,0,0,0,0,50,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,37500,"[""['update',"", ""'thread',"", ""'start',"", ""'changi',"", ""'airport',"", ""'flight',"", ""'brisbane',"", ""'due',"", ""'fly',"", ""'australia',"", ""'allow',"", ""'roam',"", ""'freely',"", ""'thru',"", ""'terminal',"", ""'60',"", ""'shop',"", ""'food',"", ""'outlets',"", ""'open',"", ""'butterfly',"", ""'garden',"", ""'close',"", ""'cactus',"", ""'garden',"", ""'open',"", ""'smoke',"", ""'smoke',"", ""'areas',"", ""'open',"", ""'see',"", ""'monorail',"", ""'system',"", ""'zip',"", ""'terminals',"", ""'strangely',"", ""'station',"", ""'operate',"", ""'moment',"", ""'wrong',"", ""'station',"", ""'test',"", ""'run',"", ""'bigger',"", ""'duty',"", ""'free',"", ""'shop',"", ""'open',"", ""'reduce',"", ""'time',"", ""'cosmetic',"", ""'duty',"", ""'free',"", ""'open',"", ""'earlier',"", ""'alcohol',"", ""'tobacco',"", ""'duty',"", ""'free',"", ""'shop',"", ""'write',"", ""'krisflyer',"", ""'lounge',"", ""'upgrade',"", ""'singapore',"", ""'bangkok',"", ""'flight',"", ""'singapore',"", ""'airways',"", ""'business',"", ""'class',"", ""'bid',"", ""'upgrade',"", ""'mainly',"", ""'lounge',"", ""'access',"", ""'11hr',"", ""'transit',"", ""'bid',"", ""'cheaper',"", ""'cost',"", ""'transit',"", ""'hotel',"", ""'room']""]",False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

if you can use an airline that either flies to tioman or codeshares with one that does then you should be able to pick this up as a through ticket with a stopover or multicity ticket fairly easily and if that airline is sia often cheaply compared to two flights separately or occasionally cheaper than the ticket to singapore alone on the right routing.
i would not have blocks of time in singapore either side of the malaysia stretch myself. that introduces bunches of travel time that could be holiday time and depending upon flight times take 1-2 days out of your schedule. i would either fly through singapore to tioman (or wherever you settle on), and then come back to singapore or arrive in singapore, do the time there then fly to tiomea and then fly back home from tiomen via singapore.
another option is the open jaw ticket where you would use eg ba or a european airline to fly into the malaysian destination and back from singapore with either a cheap lcc carrier from malaysia to singapore or with the right airline a codeshare flight from whoever the intercontinental flights are.
the advantage of through flights is that if things go wrong they are protected connections.
the best option will be determined in part why which malay destination you settle on and who flies there.
your current plan gives you nearly two weeks in singapore which is a really good run at the place.
can i ask what the tioman plan is - as if it is just beach resort there are several alternatives to look at in malaysian islands, plus bintan in indonesia which is just a ferry ride (albeit international) from singapore. bataam also fits that bill though bintan has always attracted me more.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g294262-i1747-k13625249-UK_to_Singapore_flight_Eastern_Malaysia-Singapore.html,UK to Singapore flight & Eastern Malaysia,Myrm,UK,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/myrm?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,300,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,134,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,38978,"[""['airline',"", ""'fly',"", ""'airline',"", ""'fly',"", ""'tioman',"", ""'codeshares',"", ""'one',"", ""'able',"", ""'pick',"", ""'ticket',"", ""'stopover',"", ""'multicity',"", ""'ticket',"", ""'fairly',"", ""'easily',"", ""'airline',"", ""'sia',"", ""'cheaply',"", ""'two',"", ""'flight',"", ""'separately',"", ""'occasionally',"", ""'cheaper',"", ""'ticket',"", ""'singapore',"", ""'alone',"", ""'right',"", ""'rout',"", ""'block',"", ""'time',"", ""'singapore',"", ""'side',"", ""'malaysia',"", ""'stretch',"", ""'introduce',"", ""'bunch',"", ""'travel',"", ""'time',"", ""'holiday',"", ""'time',"", ""'upon',"", ""'flight',"", ""'time',"", ""'1',"", ""'2',"", ""'days',"", ""'schedule',"", ""'fly',"", ""'singapore',"", ""'tioman',"", ""'wherever',"", ""'settle',"", ""'singapore',"", ""'arrive',"", ""'singapore',"", ""'time',"", ""'fly',"", ""'tiomea',"", ""'fly',"", ""'home',"", ""'tiomen',"", ""'via',"", ""'singapore',"", ""'open',"", ""'jaw',"", ""'ticket',"", ""'eg',"", ""'ba',"", ""'european',"", ""'airline',"", ""'fly',"", ""'malaysian',"", ""'destination',"", ""'singapore',"", ""'cheap',"", ""'lcc',"", ""'carrier',"", ""'malaysia',"", ""'singapore',"", ""'right',"", ""'airline',"", ""'codeshare',"", ""'flight',"", ""'whoever',"", ""'intercontinental',"", ""'flight',"", ""'advantage',"", ""'flight',"", ""'wrong',"", ""'protect',"", ""'connections',"", ""'determine',"", ""'part',"", ""'malay',"", ""'destination',"", ""'settle',"", ""'fly',"", ""'current',"", ""'plan',"", ""'nearly',"", ""'two',"", ""'weeks',"", ""'singapore',"", ""'good',"", ""'run',"", ""'place',"", ""'tioman',"", ""'plan',"", ""'beach',"", ""'resort',"", ""'alternatives',"", ""'malaysian',"", ""'islands',"", ""'plus',"", ""'bintan',"", ""'indonesia',"", ""'ferry',"", ""'ride',"", ""'albeit',"", ""'international',"", ""'singapore',"", ""'bataam',"", ""'fit',"", ""'bill',"", ""'bintan',"", ""'attract']""]",False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

regarding your para 2, if i were to add an extra leg to the journey and fly singapore airlines from kuala lumpur to singapore on singapore airlines i could do kul/sin and onto uk on one ticket. as late as yesterday my friend did that on his flight to perth australia. he was met off the flight in changi by sia representative and given boarding pass for sin/per segment and was able to use aerotel transit hotel airside at changi. however having had an overnight layover in kuala lumpur where he had to leave the airport and check in the following morning for the sia flight to sin together with an added overnight in changi before the flight today to per, the total journey time from kuching to perth took almost 2 days.
i can use singapore airlines budget airline scoot to fly into sin but they will only issue one ticket to sin and i would have to check in in changi again for the sin/uk flight the following day - hence my enquiry.
my preferred route as of now, and hopefully things may improve before i actually book, is using malaysia airlines all the way through from kuching to uk which will be on one ticket. unfortunately this option leaves me with a layover in kuala lumpur of 15 hours before the flight from kul to uk.
sure is a real problem flying at this difficult time.

the problem with the online checkin suggest by sia is your bags. if you buy scoot as a separate ticket and checkin separately then your bags will get sent to the carousel at changi and you will be expected to get them (ie immigration). no checkin bags and it could work. that limited information is as you say the difference between an hq answer and one from the ops people at the relevant airport. the customer service answer is correct - it just lacks specific local information that is important.
if booking via sia then you can book kuching to london as a single flight - plus with more than one flight per day you do not have to live with the 1hr 50m gap - although that then means a 12hr wait. i just check for the 12th september for example and the 12hr gap is noticeably cheaper (1830myr vs 5800 for the 1hr 50m gap option for economy) although for business that difference disappears as both flight option are 16500myr. so they are selling tickets of this type. it may be the date you want to travel they are full on one leg or the other but the basic possiblity of single through ticket purchase ising scoot from kuching and sia t lhr in business exists and i could run a dummy booking all the way to just before payment n the sept12th date. that was one way (hence the price) - its possible though unlikely that a cheap saver return ticket might be cheaper weirdly.
to be honest ) would investigate the option of an internal flight to kl from kuching and then out to lhr on malaysian. without an immigration barrier to you there the whole flight option becomes so much easier assuming the flights are there.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g294262-i1747-k13627816-Singapore_Airlines_Check_at_Changi-Singapore.html,Singapore Airlines Check at Changi,Myrm,UK,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/myrm?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,50,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,50,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,200,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,50,0,0.0,50,0,50,0,0.0,0.0,50,0,0,50,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,37500,"[""['friend',"", ""'travel',"", ""'aus',"", ""'single',"", ""'ticket',"", ""'board',"", ""'pass',"", ""'poit',"", ""'origin',"", ""'normally',"", ""'suspect',"", ""'australian',"", ""'control',"", ""'border',"", ""'confirm',"", ""'allow',"", ""'fly',"", ""'board',"", ""'pass',"", ""'point',"", ""'problem',"", ""'online',"", ""'checkin',"", ""'sia',"", ""'bag',"", ""'buy',"", ""'scoot',"", ""'separate',"", ""'ticket',"", ""'checkin',"", ""'separately',"", ""'bag',"", ""'send',"", ""'carousel',"", ""'changi',"", ""'expect',"", ""'ie',"", ""'immigration',"", ""'checkin',"", ""'bag',"", ""'work',"", ""'limit',"", ""'information',"", ""'difference',"", ""'hq',"", ""'one',"", ""'ops',"", ""'people',"", ""'relevant',"", ""'airport',"", ""'customer',"", ""'service',"", ""'correct',"", ""'lack',"", ""'specific',"", ""'local',"", ""'information',"", ""'important',"", ""'book',"", ""'via',"", ""'sia',"", ""'book',"", ""'kuching',"", ""'london',"", ""'single',"", ""'flight',"", ""'plus',"", ""'one',"", ""'flight',"", ""'per',"", ""'day',"", ""'live',"", ""'1hr',"", ""'50m',"", ""'gap',"", ""'12hr',"", ""'wait',"", ""'12th',"", ""'september',"", ""'example',"", ""'12hr',"", ""'gap',"", ""'noticeably',"", ""'cheaper',"", ""'1830myr',"", ""'vs',"", ""'5800',"", ""'1hr',"", ""'50m',"", ""'gap',"", ""'economy',"", ""'business',"", ""'difference',"", ""'disappear',"", ""'flight',"", ""'16500myr',"", ""'sell',"", ""'ticket',"", ""'type',"", ""'may',"", ""'date',"", ""'travel',"", ""'full',"", ""'one',"", ""'leg',"", ""'basic',"", ""'possiblity',"", ""'single',"", ""'ticket',"", ""'purchase',"", ""'ising',"", ""'scoot',"", ""'kuching',"", ""'sia',"", ""'lhr',"", ""'business',"", ""'exist',"", ""'run',"", ""'dummy',"", ""'book',"", ""'way',"", ""'payment',"", ""'n',"", ""'sept12th',"", ""'date',"", ""'one',"", ""'way',"", ""'hence',"", ""'price',"", ""'unlikely',"", ""'cheap',"", ""'saver',"", ""'ticket',"", ""'cheaper',"", ""'weirdly',"", ""'honest',"", ""'investigate',"", ""'internal',"", ""'flight',"", ""'kl',"", ""'kuching',"", ""'lhr',"", ""'malaysian',"", ""'immigration',"", ""'barrier',"", ""'whole',"", ""'flight',"", ""'become',"", ""'much',"", ""'easier',"", ""'assume',"", ""'flight']""]",False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

singapore open short term visitors, long coming new zealand, australia places nowhere (see list below)
at current rate relaxation controls, bulk countries (including kuwait cite location) little chance tourist visits. informed guess only, singapore government - best here.
the visit qualifies essential business travel (which means filling purpose visit differently). list places arrive let business visit, course fell category

currently include kuwait media reports expanding list january need watch.
presumably kuwaiti enquiring entry visa kuwait's embassy functions operated remotely singapore. local diplomatic mission according singapore's ministry foreign affairs im guessing need visa agent similar complete.

personally seeing course running let cancel given short time need there. clarity start visa proceedings presumably book flights etc. work there.
i expet able though.
edited: 9:44 am, january 12,","no-one here is the singapore government. they make the decisions and they make changes when they are ready. people here con only provide you the current correct information or educated guesses as to the future.
singapore is already open for short term visitors, so long as you are coming from new zealand, australia and a few other places but nowhere else (see list below)
at the current rate of relaxation of controls, for the bulk of other countries (including kuwait that you cite as your location) there is little if any chance for tourist visits. now while that is an informed guess only, because i am not the singapore government - its the best you will get here.
the only get around would be if your visit actually qualifies as essential business travel (which means filling in purpose of visit differently). this is the list of places you can arrive from that would let you do a business visit, if your course fell into that category

currently it doesn't include kuwait but they were media reports about expanding this list in january so you need to watch.
presumably you are not a kuwaiti since you are enquiring about an entry visa and because of that kuwait's embassy functions are operated remotely from singapore. there is no local diplomatic mission according to singapore's ministry of foreign affairs so im guessing you need a visa agent or similar to complete.

personally i would be seeing if the course if still running and will let you cancel given the short time before you need to be there. get some clarity on if you have to start the visa proceedings and presumably book flights etc. and work from there.
i would not expet to be able to do this though.

i could fill 14 full days singapore trying hard necessarily hitting major sites - eg wouldt round uss time, i'd need stay weeks universal hit radar. given weeks total maximum decision - trip singapore core, multicentre/couple long stopovers flavour","if the pricing strategy for us origin flights is the same as for uk based flight them a through/multicity ticket to bkk and stopping in sin on the way back could well be cheaper than one into sin only - its a marketing strategy that encourages use of singapore as a hub and is quite common to find in the aviation industry. often its not by much but still it sets the tone - i looked recently for the maldives and flying through to the maldives was £50 cheaper than flying to singapore itself and i have seen similar for other south east asia destinations. you could book this as a mutlicity ticket on their website - or if you are using a proper brick and mortar travel agent then they will know how to plate it up.
i wouldnt do this as separate tickets due to the large amount of extra time you need to add into the travel cycle to make the transfer safe as it isnt a connection. however if that doesnt bother you then you have a choice on onward airlines. scoot is part of the sia group itself, air asia has a bangkok hub (not at bkk, it uses dmk), jetstar do the run and thai airways and singapore airlines of course. thats all during normal times, of course.
if the entire trip has to fit into 2 weeks of time off, then you have to cut a couple of days for the travel in and out, at least one more disrupted day for the bkk leg and possibly 2 depending upon flight times. so thats down to about 11 days holiday time and 4-5days in bangkok leaves you only 6-7 in singapore which isnt a huge amount for singapore as a destination (i would struggle get through my personal must sees in that time) but its a lot for a stopover type visit.
i could fill 14 full days in singapore without trying too hard and without necessarily hitting all the major sites either - eg i wouldt get round to uss in that time, i'd need to stay 3 weeks for universal to hit my radar. given that if 2 weeks total is the maximum you can take off then you have to make a decision here - is this a trip to singapore at its core, or is it to be a a multicentre/couple of long stopovers in flavour",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g294262-i1747-k13593614-2022_trip_with_BKK-Singapore.html,2022 trip with BKK,Myrm,UK,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/myrm?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,50,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,200,0.0,0,0,200,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,200,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,50,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,50,0,0.0,0.0,50,0,0,200,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,50.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,92500,"[""['price',"", ""'strategy',"", ""'origin',"", ""'flight',"", ""'uk',"", ""'base',"", ""'flight',"", ""'multicity',"", ""'ticket',"", ""'bkk',"", ""'stop',"", ""'sin',"", ""'way',"", ""'cheaper',"", ""'one',"", ""'sin',"", ""'market',"", ""'strategy',"", ""'encourage',"", ""'singapore',"", ""'hub',"", ""'quite',"", ""'common',"", ""'aviation',"", ""'industry',"", ""'much',"", ""'set',"", ""'tone',"", ""'recently',"", ""'maldives',"", ""'fly',"", ""'maldives',"", ""'£50',"", ""'cheaper',"", ""'fly',"", ""'singapore',"", ""'see',"", ""'similar',"", ""'south',"", ""'east',"", ""'asia',"", ""'destinations',"", ""'book',"", ""'mutlicity',"", ""'ticket',"", ""'website',"", ""'proper',"", ""'brick',"", ""'mortar',"", ""'travel',"", ""'agent',"", ""'plate',"", ""'separate',"", ""'ticket',"", ""'due',"", ""'large',"", ""'amount',"", ""'extra',"", ""'time',"", ""'add',"", ""'travel',"", ""'cycle',"", ""'transfer',"", ""'safe',"", ""'isnt',"", ""'connection',"", ""'bother',"", ""'choice',"", ""'onward',"", ""'airlines',"", ""'scoot',"", ""'part',"", ""'sia',"", ""'group',"", ""'air',"", ""'asia',"", ""'bangkok',"", ""'hub',"", ""'bkk',"", ""'dmk',"", ""'jetstar',"", ""'run',"", ""'thai',"", ""'airways',"", ""'singapore',"", ""'airlines',"", ""'course',"", ""'normal',"", ""'time',"", ""'course',"", ""'entire',"", ""'trip',"", ""'fit',"", ""'2',"", ""'weeks',"", ""'time',"", ""'cut',"", ""'couple',"", ""'days',"", ""'travel',"", ""'least',"", ""'one',"", ""'disrupt',"", ""'day',"", ""'bkk',"", ""'leg',"", ""'possibly',"", ""'2',"", ""'upon',"", ""'flight',"", ""'time',"", ""'11',"", ""'days',"", ""'holiday',"", ""'time',"", ""'4',"", ""'5days',"", ""'bangkok',"", ""'6',"", ""'7',"", ""'singapore',"", ""'isnt',"", ""'huge',"", ""'amount',"", ""'singapore',"", ""'destination',"", ""'struggle',"", ""'personal',"", ""'must',"", ""'see',"", ""'time',"", ""'lot',"", ""'stopover',"", ""'type',"", ""'visit',"", ""'fill',"", ""'14',"", ""'full',"", ""'days',"", ""'singapore',"", ""'try',"", ""'hard',"", ""'necessarily',"", ""'hit',"", ""'major',"", ""'sit',"", ""'eg',"", ""'wouldt',"", ""'round',"", ""'uss',"", ""'time',"", ""'stay',"", ""'3',"", ""'weeks',"", ""'universal',"", ""'hit',"", ""'radar',"", ""'2',"", ""'weeks',"", ""'total',"", ""'maximum',"", ""'decision',"", ""'trip',"", ""'singapore',"", ""'core',"", ""'multicentre',"", ""'couple',"", ""'long',"", ""'stopovers',"", ""'flavour']""]",False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

dont use edreams for a start. or at the very least unless they state it is a single through ticket assume it is not.
that agency is complained about hugely on the air travel forum. they are known for cobbling together tickets if its cheaper that weay. the airlines you list above do not have interline or partnership agreements to my knowledge - so they'll give you 'one itinerary' which isnt the same as 'one ticket' and the instant you accept their offer its your fault if you do not meet entry requirements.
anytime an itinerary says to get bags, its separate tickets most likely. there are a few exceptions (eg the us, moving between london airports etc).
why are you putting a third party online booker between you and the flights in this time of all?",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g294265-i1748-k13558111-Transit_through_Changi_airport_forbidden-Singapore.html,Transit through Changi airport forbidden ?,Myrm,UK,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/myrm?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,200,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,50,0,0.0,0,0,50,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,200,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,45000,"[""['travel',"", ""'agency',"", ""'site',"", ""'edreams',"", ""'case',"", ""'flight',"", ""'sell',"", ""'one',"", ""'ticket',"", ""'edreams',"", ""'start',"", ""'least',"", ""'state',"", ""'single',"", ""'ticket',"", ""'assume',"", ""'agency',"", ""'complain',"", ""'hugely',"", ""'air',"", ""'travel',"", ""'forum',"", ""'cobble',"", ""'together',"", ""'ticket',"", ""'cheaper',"", ""'weay',"", ""'airlines',"", ""'interline',"", ""'partnership',"", ""'agreements',"", ""'knowledge',"", ""'theyll',"", ""'one',"", ""'itinerary',"", ""'isnt',"", ""'one',"", ""'ticket',"", ""'instant',"", ""'accept',"", ""'fault',"", ""'meet',"", ""'entry',"", ""'requirements',"", ""'anytime',"", ""'itinerary',"", ""'bag',"", ""'separate',"", ""'ticket',"", ""'exceptions',"", ""'eg',"", ""'move',"", ""'london',"", ""'airports',"", ""'third',"", ""'party',"", ""'online',"", ""'booker',"", ""'flight',"", ""'time']""]",False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

its a decent location, i wouldn't call it great due to distance from mrt lines in the first instance. the area isnt great for wander out and eat either.
>> i love the look of the shangri-la, can afford this but the location doesn't look so favourable.<<
id put it at even with the copthorne waterfront for location, because while being off the top of orchard road you can get down there fairly easily with all that offers plus you have the botanic gardens actually walking.
the andaz is the second best and the pan pacific the best for location (imo, obviously).
in terms of hotel internal quality - the shangrila and its garden wing are somewhat unique. the pan pacific is a great hotel but its a tall hollow core construction with all corridors looking out over that central void and the lifts are made of glass - so for those with heights issues could be a big no-no
>>we are hopefully (unless covid cancels) flying to singapore for 3 whole days and 3 nights,<<
so 3 nights really does mean 2 whole days, not 3. even if you arrived early morning of the day of travel or if you leave late on that day of departure that day will be impacted to some degree or other and there are limits to what you can do on those days. the right pattern of travel can add quite a lot of time but still not quite the freedom of a regular whole day so its worth always thinking of them separately due to possible impingement of travel. for instance, there are some travel agents that still try and send people to the night safari on the day of arrival because they arrived first thing that day and so have a 'whole day' - a practice that is a really bad idea due to the travel.
in part what restrictions you see on those days depend on when exactly the flights or other travel in/out are and what the routes and destinations/origins are. arriving in the morning from thailand is very different to arriving from the uk and likewise jetting out to australia in the evening has different issues to a midday flight out to vietnam.
a number of issues of location can be affected by this and by how you plan to get around - so if you decide taxis for speed due to maximise your whistlestop visit then location issue with mrt may not be a core problem....so there's a moderate amount of variables not pinned down that could alter my comments above.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g294265-i1748-k13469899-Singapore_first_timers_hopefully_Sept_2021-Singapore.html,Singapore first timers hopefully Sept 2021,Myrm,UK,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/myrm?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,100,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,100,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,100,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,100,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,100,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,100,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,60000,"[""['copthorne',"", ""'waterfront',"", ""'hotel',"", ""'travel',"", ""'company',"", ""'hotel',"", ""'good',"", ""'location',"", ""'decent',"", ""'location',"", ""'call',"", ""'due',"", ""'distance',"", ""'mrt',"", ""'line',"", ""'instance',"", ""'area',"", ""'isnt',"", ""'wander',"", ""'eat',"", ""'shangri',"", ""'la',"", ""'afford',"", ""'location',"", ""'favourable',"", ""'copthorne',"", ""'waterfront',"", ""'location',"", ""'top',"", ""'orchard',"", ""'road',"", ""'fairly',"", ""'easily',"", ""'plus',"", ""'botanic',"", ""'garden',"", ""'walk',"", ""'andaz',"", ""'second',"", ""'pan',"", ""'pacific',"", ""'location',"", ""'imo',"", ""'obviously',"", ""'term',"", ""'hotel',"", ""'internal',"", ""'quality',"", ""'shangrila',"", ""'garden',"", ""'wing',"", ""'somewhat',"", ""'unique',"", ""'pan',"", ""'pacific',"", ""'hotel',"", ""'tall',"", ""'hollow',"", ""'core',"", ""'construction',"", ""'corridors',"", ""'central',"", ""'void',"", ""'lift',"", ""'glass',"", ""'heights',"", ""'big',"", ""'covid',"", ""'cancel',"", ""'fly',"", ""'singapore',"", ""'3',"", ""'whole',"", ""'days',"", ""'3',"", ""'nights',"", ""'3',"", ""'nights',"", ""'2',"", ""'whole',"", ""'days',"", ""'3',"", ""'arrive',"", ""'early',"", ""'morning',"", ""'day',"", ""'travel',"", ""'late',"", ""'day',"", ""'departure',"", ""'day',"", ""'impact',"", ""'degree',"", ""'limit',"", ""'days',"", ""'right',"", ""'pattern',"", ""'travel',"", ""'add',"", ""'quite',"", ""'lot',"", ""'time',"", ""'quite',"", ""'freedom',"", ""'regular',"", ""'whole',"", ""'day',"", ""'worth',"", ""'separately',"", ""'due',"", ""'impingement',"", ""'travel',"", ""'instance',"", ""'travel',"", ""'agents',"", ""'try',"", ""'send',"", ""'people',"", ""'night',"", ""'safari',"", ""'day',"", ""'arrival',"", ""'arrive',"", ""'day',"", ""'whole',"", ""'day',"", ""'practice',"", ""'bad',"", ""'idea',"", ""'due',"", ""'travel',"", ""'part',"", ""'restrictions',"", ""'see',"", ""'days',"", ""'exactly',"", ""'flight',"", ""'travel',"", ""'rout',"", ""'destinations',"", ""'origins',"", ""'arrive',"", ""'morning',"", ""'thailand',"", ""'different',"", ""'arrive',"", ""'uk',"", ""'likewise',"", ""'jet',"", ""'australia',"", ""'different',"", ""'midday',"", ""'flight',"", ""'vietnam',"", ""'number',"", ""'location',"", ""'affect',"", ""'plan',"", ""'taxis',"", ""'speed',"", ""'due',"", ""'maximise',"", ""'whistlestop',"", ""'visit',"", ""'location',"", ""'mrt',"", ""'may',"", ""'core',"", ""'problemso',"", ""'moderate',"", ""'amount',"", ""'variables',"", ""'pin',"", ""'alter',"", ""'comment']""]",False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

it's simply possible vaccine far hand picked someone needing hospital treatment someone right tested.","taiwan lost control because they didn't oblige airline pilots to do strict quarantine. in australia, after a few incidents were suspected of being caused that way last year, airline staff now have to stay in the 'red zone' in the airport, or move into hotel quarantine, and get taken back to the airport with full ppe if their next flight is within 14 days. so that can't happen in australia.

here's an article about how thailand struggled significantly once a few cases started to spread:

that can't happen in australia.
at the moment, for 70 cases across two weeks, victorians can't travel to other states. not only that, in victoria, approximately 5,000 people are considered primary close contacts and are all in 14 days quarantine. as we're doing 'third ring' isolation, the close contacts of those 5,000 people also have to quarantine until their primary close contacts are shown to have not been mixing with them during any infectious period. last i heard that was around another 5,000 people (because they get 'released' sooner).
we're in lockdown, masks outdoors (even if walking alone down the street), and it's one person per day to the shops (not that you'd know it).
i suspect many from overseas simply don't understand the extremely strict approach to it here, and imagine it's because we're 'surrounded by water' and assume that it will get in and be spreading before we know it.
everyone coming in to the country spends 14 days in hotel quarantine and are tested several times (probably soon to include after as well). in vic the quarantine staff are tested every single day.
as for vaccination, yes, uptake was slow until victoria had its latest cluster, now the queues are from here to timbuktu at the vaccination centres, and not just in victoria. 42% of over 50s in vic have had their first vax. (given 70+ who lined up first are only just reaching the time when they can have their second az, fully vaccinated probably can't be compared with other countries.)
it's simply not possible for the vaccine to get too far out of hand before it's picked up by someone needing hospital treatment or someone doing the right thing and being tested.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g294265-i1748-k13502987-Travel_bubble_with_Australia-Singapore.html,Travel bubble with Australia,Psyvolt,AU,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Psyvolt?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,200,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,50,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,50,0,0,0,50,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,50,0,200,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,50,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,50,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,200,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,75000,"[""['taiwan',"", ""'lose',"", ""'control',"", ""'oblige',"", ""'airline',"", ""'pilot',"", ""'strict',"", ""'quarantine',"", ""'australia',"", ""'incidents',"", ""'suspect',"", ""'cause',"", ""'way',"", ""'airline',"", ""'staff',"", ""'stay',"", ""'red',"", ""'zone',"", ""'airport',"", ""'move',"", ""'hotel',"", ""'quarantine',"", ""'airport',"", ""'full',"", ""'ppe',"", ""'flight',"", ""'14',"", ""'days',"", ""'happen',"", ""'australia',"", ""'heres',"", ""'article',"", ""'thailand',"", ""'struggle',"", ""'significantly',"", ""'case',"", ""'start',"", ""'spread',"", ""'happen',"", ""'australia',"", ""'moment',"", ""'70',"", ""'case',"", ""'two',"", ""'weeks',"", ""'victorians',"", ""'travel',"", ""'state',"", ""'victoria',"", ""'approximately',"", ""'5000',"", ""'people',"", ""'primary',"", ""'close',"", ""'contact',"", ""'14',"", ""'days',"", ""'quarantine',"", ""'third',"", ""'ring',"", ""'isolation',"", ""'close',"", ""'contact',"", ""'5000',"", ""'people',"", ""'quarantine',"", ""'primary',"", ""'close',"", ""'contact',"", ""'show',"", ""'mix',"", ""'infectious',"", ""'period',"", ""'hear',"", ""'5000',"", ""'people',"", ""'release',"", ""'sooner',"", ""'lockdown',"", ""'mask',"", ""'outdoors',"", ""'walk',"", ""'alone',"", ""'street',"", ""'one',"", ""'person',"", ""'per',"", ""'day',"", ""'shop',"", ""'youd',"", ""'suspect',"", ""'many',"", ""'overseas',"", ""'simply',"", ""'extremely',"", ""'strict',"", ""'approach',"", ""'imagine',"", ""'surround',"", ""'water',"", ""'assume',"", ""'spread',"", ""'country',"", ""'spend',"", ""'14',"", ""'days',"", ""'hotel',"", ""'quarantine',"", ""'test',"", ""'time',"", ""'soon',"", ""'include',"", ""'vic',"", ""'quarantine',"", ""'staff',"", ""'test',"", ""'single',"", ""'day',"", ""'vaccination',"", ""'uptake',"", ""'slow',"", ""'victoria',"", ""'latest',"", ""'cluster',"", ""'queue',"", ""'timbuktu',"", ""'vaccination',"", ""'centre',"", ""'victoria',"", ""'42',"", ""'50s',"", ""'vic',"", ""'vax',"", ""'70',"", ""'line',"", ""'reach',"", ""'time',"", ""'second',"", ""'az',"", ""'fully',"", ""'vaccinate',"", ""'countries',"", ""'simply',"", ""'vaccine',"", ""'far',"", ""'hand',"", ""'pick',"", ""'hospital',"", ""'treatment',"", ""'right',"", ""'test']""]",False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

i don't think it's necessarily singapore with the caution, they designated australia a green zone ages ago.
the sticking point seems to be the australian government being prepared to enter discussions to get the planning moving, even if our vaccination rates don't allow a bubble for many months.
singapore airlines are correct, if you start the planning now, you are more likely to be able to iron out the wrinkles, than if you make a rushed plan at the last minute.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g294265-i1748-k13502987-Travel_bubble_with_Australia-Singapore.html,Travel bubble with Australia,BillUK32,Asia,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BillUK32?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,100,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,100,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,100,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,30000,"[""['necessarily',"", ""'singapore',"", ""'caution',"", ""'designate',"", ""'australia',"", ""'green',"", ""'zone',"", ""'age',"", ""'stick',"", ""'point',"", ""'australian',"", ""'government',"", ""'prepare',"", ""'enter',"", ""'discussions',"", ""'plan',"", ""'move',"", ""'vaccination',"", ""'rat',"", ""'allow',"", ""'bubble',"", ""'many',"", ""'months',"", ""'singapore',"", ""'airlines',"", ""'correct',"", ""'start',"", ""'plan',"", ""'able',"", ""'iron',"", ""'wrinkle',"", ""'rush',"", ""'plan',"", ""'minute']""]",False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

we’ve moved travel dates times wondering when/if entitled refund december flights due border restrictions place malaysia singapore uk travellers. (we flying kl 16 nights malaysia followed nights singapore flying home singapore).
i’m sad write we’ve accepted christmas plans won’t happening .
thanks advance !
ps: ive emailed sia several times respond haven’t clear answer.","hi again!
i’ve also posted this on the airline forum but thought i might have more responses here!
i notice sia have updated their website to say:-
“you can seek a refund of the unused portion of your ticket in the event of a flight cancellation, international border closures, or if you test positive for covid-19 and are unable to travel”
i’m curious if anyone who booked flights directly with singapore airlines (after march 2020) successfully received a refund if they were unable to fly to their destination due to border restrictions? i’m not referring to flight cancellations, i’m referring to when flights are still active but border restrictions are in place preventing you from entering.
has anyone done this successfully and if so, at what point did you apply for the refund (how close to your travel date?)?
we’ve moved our travel dates 3 times already and are wondering when/if we are entitled to a refund for our december flights due to border restrictions still in place in malaysia and singapore for uk travellers. (we were flying to kl to have 16 nights in malaysia followed by 7 nights in singapore and flying home from singapore).
i’m sad to write this but we’ve accepted now that our christmas plans won’t be happening .
thanks in advance !

57,5310,SG,">> i’m flying usa thailand layover sin, wondering expect layover changi.<<
ok depends heavily flight tickets bought - flying leg help example. flying - style question sound talking near future rather post-covid.
if separate tickets flying routing covid restrictions lifted permitted enter singapore. however, people seeing cheap flight costs singapore compared tickets grabbing understanding cheap.
post-covid restrictions separate tickets a) need much larger layover transfer safe isnt quick round airport processes b) full round immigration, bag recovery, customs recheckin.
if single journey ticket via singapore checkin currently fine singapore airlines plus limited set agreements with. changi's website sia's website list. stand flight routing plane, moved transit holding area stay next flight. order food drink via app vending machines holding pen otherwise stay there. partial exception layover long enough prebooking transit hotel escorted room escorted stay up. airside transits done much faster currently dont want long help it.
once covid restrictions lifted airside transit simple - plane, disgorged airside sterile departure area, ignore signs immigration/arrival simply anything want time terminal cores want visit, gate opens (1hr 1hr15min ahead takeoff normally).
security changi done gate (hence early opening), full body scanners - 15 across terminals. every gate every flight. different medical devices react different scanning technologies differently, device compatible scanner alternative process. assume travelled likely carry form medical note - show security there. long arent trying dash last minute shouldnt issue.

ok so this depends heavily on how the flight tickets are bought - who are you flying with on each leg may help with that for example. also when you are flying - from the style of the question it sound s like we are talking near future rather than post-covid.
if these are separate tickets then you are not flying that routing until covid restrictions are lifted because you are not permitted to enter singapore. however, some people are seeing cheap flight costs in and out of singapore compared to through tickets and grabbing them without understanding why they are cheap.
post-covid restrictions then separate tickets mean a) you need a much larger layover to make the transfer safe and that isnt just about how quick you can get round the airport processes either and b) you do the full round of immigration, bag recovery, customs and then go to recheckin.
if this is a single journey ticket via singapore with through checkin etc then currently that is fine on singapore airlines plus a limited set that they have agreements with. changi's website and sia's website have the list. as things stand for this flight routing you will get off the plane, you then get moved to a transit holding area where you stay until your next flight. you can order food and drink via an app or from vending machines in the holding pen but otherwise you stay there. the partial exception is that if your layover is long enough and you have a prebooking with the transit hotel then you get escorted there and into your room and then escorted back once your stay is up. these airside transits can be done much faster and currently you dont want a long one if you can help it.
once covid restrictions are lifted then an airside transit like this is simple - you get off the plane, you are disgorged into the airside sterile departure area, you ignore signs to immigration/arrival and you simply do anything you want or have time for in the terminal cores you want to visit, you then go to the gate when it opens (1hr to 1hr15min ahead of takeoff normally).
security at changi is done at the gate (hence the early opening), they do have some full body scanners - 15 or so i think across 4 terminals. so its not every gate nor every flight. different medical devices react to different scanning technologies differently, so if your device is not compatible with the scanner they will have an alternative process. i assume since you seem to have travelled before you likely carry some form of medical note for this - just show it to security and they should go from there. so long as you arent trying to dash in last minute it shouldnt be an issue.

any guidance much appreciated.","dear all,
thanks in advance for your help. we are a couple planning to travel to leh in the last week of april 2021. here is the plan
day 1 - arrive by flight at leh, stay at hotel and rest. go for a walk to the nearby market.
day 2 - local sightseeing
day 3 - check out from the hotel in leh and go to nubra valley to stay for one (or it should be two as we will reach mostly by afternoon?) - also where to stay? and what to do?
day 4 or day 5- goto pangong lake - stay for a day (or 2?)
the next day - back to leh - stay for 1 night and fly the next morning.
looks like around 7-8 days trip.
also, i have few questions
- what are the best ways for transportation from leh-nubra-pangong-leh?
- we are not a very pro with a bike but if we rent a bike can we do all this journey on a bike with moderate skills? also is it safe to ride a bike considering we are not a group but only 2 people riding 1 bike?
- what kind of clothing we need, do we need very heavy winter jackets? we need to travel very light if it is a trip on the bike.
- how is the internet coverage? could we have a couple of business calls during this trip. i understand there will not be internet at pangong but otherwise in leh or nubra how's the connectivity? which network is reliable?
any guidance will be very much appreciated.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g297625-i10473-k13518223-Is_this_itinerary_good_for_Leh_in_last_week_for_April_2021-Leh_Leh_District_Ladakh_Jammu_.html,Is this itinerary good for Leh in last week for April 2021,Rashmi,"Nagpur, India",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RashmiKat?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,50,0.0,50,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,200,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,200,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,50,0,0,0,0,0,200,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,67500,"[""['dear',"", ""'advance',"", ""'help',"", ""'couple',"", ""'plan',"", ""'travel',"", ""'leh',"", ""'week',"", ""'april',"", ""'plan',"", ""'day',"", ""'1',"", ""'arrive',"", ""'flight',"", ""'leh',"", ""'stay',"", ""'hotel',"", ""'rest',"", ""'walk',"", ""'nearby',"", ""'market',"", ""'day',"", ""'2',"", ""'local',"", ""'sightsee',"", ""'day',"", ""'3',"", ""'hotel',"", ""'leh',"", ""'nubra',"", ""'valley',"", ""'stay',"", ""'one',"", ""'two',"", ""'reach',"", ""'mostly',"", ""'afternoon',"", ""'stay',"", ""'day',"", ""'4',"", ""'day',"", ""'5',"", ""'goto',"", ""'pangong',"", ""'lake',"", ""'stay',"", ""'day',"", ""'2',"", ""'day',"", ""'leh',"", ""'stay',"", ""'1',"", ""'night',"", ""'fly',"", ""'morning',"", ""'7',"", ""'8',"", ""'days',"", ""'trip',"", ""'question',"", ""'ways',"", ""'transportation',"", ""'leh',"", ""'nubra',"", ""'pangong',"", ""'leh',"", ""'pro',"", ""'bike',"", ""'rent',"", ""'bike',"", ""'journey',"", ""'bike',"", ""'moderate',"", ""'skills',"", ""'safe',"", ""'ride',"", ""'bike',"", ""'group',"", ""'2',"", ""'people',"", ""'rid',"", ""'1',"", ""'bike',"", ""'kind',"", ""'clothe',"", ""'heavy',"", ""'winter',"", ""'jacket',"", ""'travel',"", ""'light',"", ""'trip',"", ""'bike',"", ""'internet',"", ""'coverage',"", ""'couple',"", ""'business',"", ""'call',"", ""'trip',"", ""'internet',"", ""'pangong',"", ""'leh',"", ""'nubra',"", ""'hows',"", ""'connectivity',"", ""'network',"", ""'reliable',"", ""'guidance',"", ""'much']""]",False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

pragnesh - if the situation improves enough for you by november, i can tell you that my son and i enjoyed a planned 15-hour layover in dubai in 2019, even though it was an overnight layover. we took a cab to the gold souk and walked around that part of deira, then took an abra over to the textile souk, then walked a bit in al fahidi historic area. we then took a cab past some sights - including the burj khalifa - and slept a few hours at a pretty hotel before heading back to the airport for our morning flight out. ideally our layover would have been entirely in daylight hours so we could see more!, but we enjoyed our small taste of dubai. we're looking forward to visiting again - whenever that becomes possible.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g295424-i872-k13484871-Lay_over_for_12_hrs_in_dubai-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html,Lay over for 12 hrs in dubai,myfamilystravelagent,San Francisco,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/myfamilystravelagent?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,200,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,50,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,50,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,200,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,45000,"[""['pragnesh',"", ""'plan',"", ""'trip',"", ""'dubai',"", ""'late',"", ""'november',"", ""'full',"", ""'covid',"", ""'situation',"", ""'hasnt',"", ""'improve',"", ""'cancel',"", ""'fully',"", ""'cancel',"", ""'able',"", ""'hotel',"", ""'reservations',"", ""'plan',"", ""'shelf',"", ""'shaun',"", ""'description',"", ""'covid',"", ""'regulations',"", ""'place',"", ""'pragnesh',"", ""'situation',"", ""'improve',"", ""'november',"", ""'tell',"", ""'son',"", ""'plan',"", ""'15',"", ""'hour',"", ""'layover',"", ""'dubai',"", ""'2019',"", ""'overnight',"", ""'layover',"", ""'cab',"", ""'gold',"", ""'souk',"", ""'walk',"", ""'part',"", ""'deira',"", ""'abra',"", ""'textile',"", ""'souk',"", ""'walk',"", ""'al',"", ""'fahidi',"", ""'historic',"", ""'area',"", ""'cab',"", ""'past',"", ""'sight',"", ""'include',"", ""'burj',"", ""'khalifa',"", ""'sleep',"", ""'hours',"", ""'pretty',"", ""'hotel',"", ""'head',"", ""'airport',"", ""'morning',"", ""'flight',"", ""'ideally',"", ""'layover',"", ""'entirely',"", ""'daylight',"", ""'hours',"", ""'see',"", ""'small',"", ""'taste',"", ""'dubai',"", ""'visit',"", ""'whenever',"", ""'become']""]",False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

thank","hi
thought just give an quick update as the forum members have been so kind.
evening flight last night with etihad from lhr, from arriving to the airport to getting through security etc and into duty free took 20mins.
pcr test was checked.
i landed in abu dhabi airport, very quick and efficient and a took a pcr test (took mobile number, but test results arrived within 2 hours on al hosn app).
after taking the pcr test at the airport the airport staff ask how you are booked to get to dubai, i was booked by etihad complimentary chauffeur so they call the service and make sure you are booked onto this, once you exit the terminal they service is waiting for you to transport you.

edited: 4:59 am, april 28,","i would not booking until the covid situation in thailand is a bit more certain.
the country has been almost covid free since the pandemic started but as in india and the philippines for example where the new more transmissable strains have started to cause a massive escalation in numbers then it could happen here.
the country hopes to have half the population vaccinated this year but there is no guarantee that by february either quarantine free travel will be allowed or you will be allowed back into the uk (i assume) without need to spend £1750 on a uk quarantine hotel.
february isn't high season for flights and the hotels will not be full so no need to rush
as for airlines if booking to phuket vis bangkok make sure the ticket is a through ticket issued by the airline where if there is a delay you will be put on the next flight as if a self transfer you run the risk of missing your onward flight if there is any delay.

how do you plan to get to khao lak ? - its 760 kms from bangkok - thats further than manchester to penzance ?
if you dont mind 14 hours in a coach then go for it but if flying on to phuket first then be aware of the hazards of not booking a through ticket with one airline where if you miss your connection you are stranded and also be aware there re two major airports in bangkok
it may be that searching airlines such as ethiad and emirates who fly from manchester or thai singapore malaysia who all have flights into phuket but would involve leaving from london or tui who run weekly charters are your best bet.

using a budget airline for the last leg is cheaper, but as said above, it needs to be stressed that bangkok has 2 airports. most long haul fly into bkk (suvarnabhumi) and most budget airlines fly out of don mueang (dmk). it is a 40 minute bus ride between the two, plus another check in. not recommended after a long haul flight unless you are used to it.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g297914-i10908-k13535153-Who_do_usually_fly_with-Khao_Lak_Phang_Nga_Province.html,Who do usually fly with,sueinwales2016,0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sueinwales2016?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,300,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,300,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,60000,"[""['emirates',"", ""'indeed',"", ""'fly',"", ""'phuket',"", ""'useful',"", ""'manchester',"", ""'dubai',"", ""'phuket',"", ""'show',"", ""'bookable',"", ""'website',"", ""'airlines',"", ""'may',"", ""'bkk',"", ""'phuket',"", ""'leg',"", ""'part',"", ""'ticket',"", ""'airline',"", ""'way',"", ""'luggage',"", ""'transfer',"", ""'plan',"", ""'bkk',"", ""'airport',"", ""'budget',"", ""'airline',"", ""'leg',"", ""'cheaper',"", ""'stress',"", ""'bangkok',"", ""'2',"", ""'airports',"", ""'long',"", ""'haul',"", ""'fly',"", ""'bkk',"", ""'suvarnabhumi',"", ""'budget',"", ""'airlines',"", ""'fly',"", ""'mueang',"", ""'dmk',"", ""'40',"", ""'minute',"", ""'bus',"", ""'ride',"", ""'two',"", ""'plus',"", ""'recommend',"", ""'long',"", ""'haul',"", ""'flight']""]",False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

my intention is that if i can i would like to do business class over there but on my return to uk, go economy, unless i can afford to travel business on return. i have a feeling, im gonna be saving hard to make this happen :)
i have a few questions if thats ok.
1. i intend to fly from edinburgh but guess im limited to which flights go to thailand from there. qatar seems my best option. now i heard they offer sales throughout the year, do i just sign up to a newsletter to get advance warning or how does it work?
2. if i do book business class with qatar, does that give you a fast track through anypoints in either leaving uk or arriving in thailand?
3. do most airlines allow you one class one way and another on return?
4. im going by myself this time. been twice with friends, and although i suffer anxiety, i want to do this. previously visited pattaya (didnt like) and chiang mai (was ok).i enjoyed patong but would you suggest anywhere else with a lovely beach or you know something you see in movies which looks bliss. as long as i can see some show, im happy.
thanks and apologies if this has been asked like a trillion times.
i dont have a budet in mind yet.
many thanks

wat prajomklao rachanusorn - according google maps, 2.5 hr drive along route 118, 1252...how much time expect site? stairs (approx. 1km) difficult (steep?), long ascend? (i subjective, average?) trouble stairs partner might, objects last leg experience, trip worth it? words, able see white domes scenery point driver drops area base stairs?
lampang - google maps says approx. 1.5 hr drive cm via route 11. could stop lamphun along way? lp looks fun city spend day head cm day. yes? no?
since see places, idea?...get started early leave cm wat pr, spend morning there, drive lampang, spend afternoon dinner, drive cm. basically, long full-day loop. ambitious? option spend night lampang, next day tour city head cm. choice (wat lampang) day-trip, choose why? attempt circle (cm, wat pr, lp, cm) day trip place, able rent car day, roads scary/complex could self drive?...or easier tour (wat) bus train (lampang)?
doi inthanon nat'l park - organized tour full-day trip. temple scenery look interesting, neither much interest nature hikes, waterfalls, etc., worthwhile? (admittedly, looked much info inthanon yet.)
day (tues): enjoy old city relax (if spent night lp return cm early/mid-afternoon, afternoon spent wandering cm last time).

thank much opinions advice!!!...ana","hi all and thanks in advance for answering questions and advice!
partner and i will be in chiang mai 3rd-8th december 2021, arriving from u.s. 10:30 am 12.3, leaving 12.8 tbd (possibility of extending to 12.9).
will be quite tired after long international flight, and partner gets jet-lagged easily. he is 61, i am 65, both in good health but i am more active than is he. we plan on spending most of our time in cm in old city area with day trips from cm to see 1-2-3 other places. would like to run my itinerary by you to get opinions:
day 1 (fri.): flight arrives cm 10:30 am, taxi into city, will store luggage at hotel (tbd in old city) and meander old city until allowed to check in officially. then will probably nap, relax at hotel, grab bite to eat, sleep
day 2 (sat): explore cm morning, take afternoon tour to doi suthep
day 3 (sun): spend the day walking city, seeing temples, other city sites, visit sunday night market (there is a sunday night market, yes?)
day 4 (mon): would like to take a day trip outside cm and this is where the bulk of my questions lie. following are the day trip choices being considered at this point and am open to other suggestions, considering i have already researched and discounted elephant trips, tribe village visits, and chiang rai golden circle trips.
wat prajomklao rachanusorn - according to google maps, it is 2.5 hr drive along route 118, 1252...how much time should we expect to be at the site? are the stairs (approx. 1km) very difficult (steep?), and about how long might they take to ascend? (i know this is subjective, but average?) i would have no trouble with the stairs but partner might, so if he objects to that last leg of the experience, is the trip worth it? in other words, will we be able to see the white domes and some scenery from the point where the driver drops us at the area at base of the stairs?
lampang - google maps says approx. 1.5 hr drive from cm via route 11. think we could also stop at lamphun along the way? lp looks like fun city to spend the day then head back to cm same day. yes? no?
since i would like to see both of the above places, what say you all to this idea?...get started early to leave cm to wat pr, spend morning there, then drive down to lampang, spend afternoon there and dinner, drive back to cm. basically, make it a long full-day loop. too ambitious? option is to spend night in lampang, next day tour city and head back to cm. if choice is one or the other (wat or lampang) for a day-trip, which would you choose and why? if we don't attempt the circle (cm, wat pr, lp, cm) and just do day trip to either place, would we be able to rent a car for the day, and are roads not too scary/complex the we could self drive?...or would it be easier to just take a tour (wat) or bus or train (lampang)?
doi inthanon nat'l park - would probably take an organized tour there as a full-day trip. temple and scenery look interesting, but neither of us has much interest in doing any of the nature hikes, waterfalls, etc., so would this be worthwhile? (admittedly, i have not looked at much info on inthanon yet.)
day 5 (tues): enjoy old city and relax (if we spent night before in lp we will return to cm early/mid-afternoon, so afternoon will be spent wandering cm one last time).
day 6 (wed): depart cm to sukhothai by driver or bus, or to airport for flight to bangkok. time of day and next destination tbd. i'm sure we could spend more time in chiang mai, but we have three other destinations we would like to explore, have only three weeks, and are fairly confident we will not have the opportunity to come back to thailand in the future. this is it!

i usually try to estimate my cash well the last couple of days of a trip, and then if its just the equivalent of $10-20 leftover, i usually would rather spend it inside the airport on a nice meal or food/snacks to take on the plane or even a book or gift or something. if it's more than i can spend in the airport though and i know i won't be returning to said country, then i'll exchange it. i wouldn't recommend cutting it so close though on your estimation that you barely have enough for the taxi to the airport...i've done that before. :)",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g304551-i3482-k13555053-Where_can_I_exchange_money_after_arrival_at_New_Delhi-New_Delhi_National_Capital_Territory.html,Where can I exchange money after arrival at New Delhi?,wandering_home,US,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wandering_home?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,200,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,50,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,50,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,50,0,0,50,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,30000,"[""['correctly',"", ""'exchange',"", ""'money',"", ""'exit',"", ""'india',"", ""'home',"", ""'country',"", ""'correct',"", ""'true',"", ""'major',"", ""'international',"", ""'airport',"", ""'exchange',"", ""'counter',"", ""'delhi',"", ""'airport',"", ""'area',"", ""'past',"", ""'security',"", ""'exit',"", ""'country',"", ""'dollars',"", ""'may',"", ""'worth',"", ""'fee',"", ""'rate',"", ""'good',"", ""'try',"", ""'estimate',"", ""'cash',"", ""'couple',"", ""'days',"", ""'trip',"", ""'equivalent',"", ""'10',"", ""'20',"", ""'leftover',"", ""'spend',"", ""'inside',"", ""'airport',"", ""'meal',"", ""'food',"", ""'snack',"", ""'plane',"", ""'book',"", ""'gift',"", ""'something',"", ""'spend',"", ""'airport',"", ""'country',"", ""'ill',"", ""'exchange',"", ""'recommend',"", ""'cut',"", ""'close',"", ""'estimation',"", ""'barely',"", ""'taxi',"", ""'airportive']""]",False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

am landing at kolkatta domestic airport at 8am and my next domestic flight is at 1.30pm on the same day.
is it possible to visit the dakinshwarkali temple within that time?
as per google, it takes 45mins from the airport. my thinking is that even if i leave the airport by 9am and rent out an ola cab, i should be able to visit the temple and be back at the airport by 12.30pm.
kindly let me know if otherwise.
since am travelling solo, any and all suggestions are welcome.
can any other places enroute be covered or will that be a stretch?

when hopping via del or bom i always allow about 3hrs and longer if you have to change terminals.
both delhi and mumbai have different terminals for most of the low cost airlines, e.g. spicejet, indigo etc. the international carriers tend to all go from the same terminal, e.g air india, air asia. however, there is no hard and fast rule so check carefully when you book.
changing terminals in delhi is fairly straight forward, by shuttle bus. mumbai is very different, you have to take a taxi. there used to be a shuttle bus but in order that taxi drivers can rip you off they stopped it and now the only way is to smile and pay.
i have my flight booked to del in late december but not all the low cost airlines have published prices yet so i am still waiting for that.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g297604-i6045-k13507780-Airport_advice-Goa.html,Airport advice,Itcanbedone,AU,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Itcanbedone?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,134,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,300,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,300,0,0,134,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,77956,"[""['book',"", ""'flight',"", ""'way',"", ""'air',"", ""'india',"", ""'carrier',"", ""'uk',"", ""'book',"", ""'separate',"", ""'ticket',"", ""'fly',"", ""'direct',"", ""'goa',"", ""'heathrow',"", ""'air',"", ""'india',"", ""'certain',"", ""'days',"", ""'week',"", ""'hop',"", ""'via',"", ""'del',"", ""'bom',"", ""'allow',"", ""'3hrs',"", ""'longer',"", ""'terminals',"", ""'delhi',"", ""'mumbai',"", ""'different',"", ""'terminals',"", ""'low',"", ""'cost',"", ""'airlines',"", ""'eg',"", ""'spicejet',"", ""'indigo',"", ""'international',"", ""'carriers',"", ""'tend',"", ""'terminal',"", ""'eg',"", ""'air',"", ""'india',"", ""'air',"", ""'asia',"", ""'hard',"", ""'fast',"", ""'rule',"", ""'carefully',"", ""'book',"", ""'terminals',"", ""'delhi',"", ""'fairly',"", ""'straight',"", ""'shuttle',"", ""'bus',"", ""'mumbai',"", ""'different',"", ""'taxi',"", ""'shuttle',"", ""'bus',"", ""'order',"", ""'taxi',"", ""'drivers',"", ""'rip',"", ""'stop',"", ""'way',"", ""'smile',"", ""'pay',"", ""'flight',"", ""'book',"", ""'del',"", ""'late',"", ""'december',"", ""'low',"", ""'cost',"", ""'airlines',"", ""'publish',"", ""'price',"", ""'wait']""]",False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

also, find way there, fantastic could find backpacker team bit.","this is going to be a unique-ish post.
i run a monetized youtube channel that has over 17m views and 30k subscribers and i've made 10k from it so far.
60% of my viewers are from india, so for a while i was toying with the notion of doing an india trip and shooting vids for my channel there. and besides just my yt channel, from what i've researched india looks like the kind of place that would be incredible to backpack in--a great country for self discovery and spirituality (and also indian food is fire lol). call it 60% pleasure/40% business.
so, after being fully vaccinated, last week i pulled the trigger and bought a covid price $370 ticket from lax-india on 5/6
unfortunately, it's looking like the airline semi-scammed me, since they aren't issuing tourist visas at this time. it's good that i did research, or i very easily could have taken the 20 hour flight, and then been told at the airport i had to get the next trip back home!
now, i'm trying to get a business visa, but this is a big big big big long shot because yt is clearly not a typical business where u have a client in india or something like that and that's why you're visiting. is there something i'm missing here about being able to get a visa now?
also, if i can find a way to get there, it would be fantastic if i could find another backpacker to team up with for a bit.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g293860-i511-k13526460-1st_India_Trip_and_Visa_Question-India.html,1st India Trip and Visa Question,Ben P,0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/benjaminpB3135SA?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,50,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,200,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,50,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,50,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,50,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,50,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,200,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,200,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,50,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,75000,"[""['unique',"", ""'ish',"", ""'post',"", ""'run',"", ""'monetize',"", ""'youtube',"", ""'channel',"", ""'17m',"", ""'view',"", ""'30k',"", ""'subscribers',"", ""'10k',"", ""'far',"", ""'60',"", ""'viewers',"", ""'india',"", ""'toy',"", ""'notion',"", ""'india',"", ""'trip',"", ""'shoot',"", ""'vids',"", ""'channel',"", ""'besides',"", ""'yt',"", ""'channel',"", ""'research',"", ""'india',"", ""'kind',"", ""'place',"", ""'incredible',"", ""'backpack',"", ""'country',"", ""'self',"", ""'discovery',"", ""'spirituality',"", ""'indian',"", ""'food',"", ""'fire',"", ""'call',"", ""'60',"", ""'pleasure',"", ""'40',"", ""'business',"", ""'fully',"", ""'vaccinate',"", ""'week',"", ""'pull',"", ""'trigger',"", ""'buy',"", ""'covid',"", ""'price',"", ""'370',"", ""'ticket',"", ""'lax',"", ""'india',"", ""'5',"", ""'6',"", ""'unfortunately',"", ""'airline',"", ""'semi',"", ""'scammed',"", ""'arent',"", ""'tourist',"", ""'visa',"", ""'time',"", ""'good',"", ""'research',"", ""'easily',"", ""'20',"", ""'hour',"", ""'flight',"", ""'tell',"", ""'airport',"", ""'trip',"", ""'home',"", ""'try',"", ""'business',"", ""'visa',"", ""'big',"", ""'big',"", ""'big',"", ""'big',"", ""'long',"", ""'shoot',"", ""'yt',"", ""'clearly',"", ""'typical',"", ""'business',"", ""'client',"", ""'india',"", ""'something',"", ""'visit',"", ""'something',"", ""'miss',"", ""'able',"", ""'visa',"", ""'way',"", ""'fantastic',"", ""'backpacker',"", ""'team']""]",False,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

you could rejig a little and do bangkok only at the end of your stay. either get private transfer from kanchanaburi (hotel will arrange or book transfer with oriental escapes) to the train station, or to the airport for flight to surat thani (or other). i think just one night at eh will be a real pain, settling in just to pack up again in the morning. you may also find that you are all shattered after a night of (not) sleeping on the train, so not sure how much you will be able to enjoy your eh stay. we are always tired and grumpy after the overnight train. you could also stay at the beach first, then do eh before returning to bangkok. you can do the elephant experience from any khao sok accomodation. (or from khao lak or many other places, for that matter)
how about:
18,19,20 kanchanaburi
21,22. eh or other khao sok
23,24,25,26,27 phuket or other beach resort (have a look at khao lak, or kamala)
28,29,30 bangkok
31 fly back home.
if taking the train one way between surat thani and bangkok allow an extra night for this.
wherever you end up at christmas, check in advance to see if they have a compulsory dinner charge for that day. avoids a nasty shock!!",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g293915-i3686-k13454131-Thailand_daydreaming_help_with_itinerary_with_young_kids-Thailand.html,Thailand daydreaming - help with itinerary with young kids,sueinwales2016,Galway,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sueinwales2016?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,50,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,50,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,50,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,50,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,50,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,50,0,0,200,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,50,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,37500,"[""['airline',"", ""'airport',"", ""'50',"", ""'minute',"", ""'layover',"", ""'zurich',"", ""'swissair',"", ""'fine',"", ""'frankfurt',"", ""'rejig',"", ""'little',"", ""'bangkok',"", ""'end',"", ""'stay',"", ""'private',"", ""'transfer',"", ""'kanchanaburi',"", ""'hotel',"", ""'arrange',"", ""'book',"", ""'transfer',"", ""'oriental',"", ""'escape',"", ""'train',"", ""'station',"", ""'airport',"", ""'flight',"", ""'surat',"", ""'thani',"", ""'one',"", ""'night',"", ""'eh',"", ""'real',"", ""'pain',"", ""'settle',"", ""'pack',"", ""'morning',"", ""'may',"", ""'shatter',"", ""'night',"", ""'sleep',"", ""'train',"", ""'much',"", ""'able',"", ""'eh',"", ""'stay',"", ""'tire',"", ""'grumpy',"", ""'overnight',"", ""'train',"", ""'stay',"", ""'beach',"", ""'eh',"", ""'bangkok',"", ""'elephant',"", ""'experience',"", ""'khao',"", ""'sok',"", ""'accomodation',"", ""'khao',"", ""'lak',"", ""'many',"", ""'place',"", ""'matter',"", ""'181920',"", ""'kanchanaburi',"", ""'2122',"", ""'eh',"", ""'khao',"", ""'sok',"", ""'2324252627',"", ""'phuket',"", ""'beach',"", ""'resort',"", ""'khao',"", ""'lak',"", ""'kamala',"", ""'282930',"", ""'bangkok',"", ""'31',"", ""'fly',"", ""'home',"", ""'train',"", ""'one',"", ""'way',"", ""'surat',"", ""'thani',"", ""'bangkok',"", ""'allow',"", ""'extra',"", ""'night',"", ""'wherever',"", ""'end',"", ""'christmas',"", ""'advance',"", ""'see',"", ""'compulsory',"", ""'dinner',"", ""'charge',"", ""'day',"", ""'avoid',"", ""'nasty',"", ""'shock']""]",False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

interestingly, the aa website lists dfw as an airport with ""expedited check-in"" for verifly users. however, upon further examination, this may primarily be online/via the app.
if you upload required documents and test results, you can ""get verified status for travel. from there you can check in using the app, get your mobile boarding pass and streamline your airport experience, even for international flights."" hmm, sounds good, but i am not convinced.
will i try verifly? yes. do i believe it will speed up the process? maybe, but if there is no separate line and you still have to check baggage, then it may only expedite things when one reaches the counter after having waited in the usual long line.
i am glad to hear you had a quick tsa check. unfortunately, here in louisville, reports of tsa lines taking one to two hours were on the news this week.
i do hope they open additional e-gates at heathrow. standing in crowded airport queues for lengthy amounts of time, and assuming some will not socially distance, would seem to increase the risk of covid .

edited: 4:03 pm, july 18,","if you don't tick ""stay in the uk"" you shouldn't be asked for your arrival test reference number. you only need to have booked the day 2 and day 8 tests if you are spending time in the uk and are going through immigration in the uk.
if you are on a proper transit flight on a through ticket on the same day with any checked bags being transferred by the airline, you will just stay airside and follow the ""transfer"" signs.
i have been rung every day since i landed from the usa on tuesday despite requesting text messages because my phone has to be on ""silent"" when i am working.
fortunately, so far, the calls have come when i am not on zoom, teams or cvp.
when i asked about this, i was told that the option of text messages should not have been on the plf because they were not set up for that.
the callers have enquired about my name and year of birth, asked if i am at the address i gave on the plf and have read various bits about quarantining to me. they have been very polite and the only difficulty was with a soft voiced man with an impenetrable accent. the fault wasn't his but that of the person who hired him so i certainly didn't complain, but it was a fairly fraught 10 minutes.
i had my day 5 test to release test today with the results guaranteed by midnight tonight.
i was told the results would go automatically to the test and trace people and that i would only be rung on day 8, when i would also need to take my day 8 test.

//the reason i asked whether i will have to take another covid test if i stay off-airport - when i get back to airport next morning to check-in at ai counter for bags, will they consider me a domestic passenger and ask for things (including for covid test) as they would any other passenger traveling domestically?//
last (month) when i visited kerala there were no rules for covid test,only have to register at jagratha portal if someone in visiting for short trip up to 7 days,if longer then there was rule for quarentine and test.i was there for only 3 nights so no test and quarentine.
as i am indian so after exiting delhi airport 1st thing what we did was to start using aadhar card for any identify need , showing passport with recent arrival stamp was not a good idea anywhere.later i saw that in both tn and kerala before check in a self declaration form need to be fill with a question whether i visited any foreign country in recent days or arrived from overseas in last 7 days, though it was already more than 7 days so didn't needed to write a lie(for tn i m sure but little doubt about kerala)
as you are having non indian passport so you can't hide your arrival by any chance during your visit(and i won't suggest anyone to do or do anything against the rule),you should check kerala rules specifically,may ask in kerala forum.as per goi rule after clearing immigration and custom at delhi you are free to move but then applies rules of particular state.
.after arriving india i had already travelled between 7 states,took 9 domestic flights and every state have own rules and regulations,lots of confusion on the ground.

b","hi there,
i'm early 30s traveling with two others (moderate budget), just trying to get a feel for whether this itinerary is too ambitious. we have a week on either side of a 1-week destination wedding in galle, sri lanka (total approx 20 days). here is my proposed itinerary, very open to suggestions of where to stay (kerala houseboat, etc)/edits to make the trip more enjoyable and tolerable:
(day 1-2)
cheap, quick (1hr) flight from bangalore to madurai, see some tamil temples (good reference for experiencing sri lanka tamil vibes later), chill and shop for a day or two.
(day 3-4)
3.5hr private car transfer from madurai to thekaddy/periyar np for spice plantation exploration/bamboo rafting (these are the same place 7mi apart, so would spend two days here).
(day 5-6)
3.5hr private car transfer to alleppey where we would jump on a houseboat and chill on the canals of the arabian sea for a couple days.
(day 7)
1hr private transfer to kochi, a cool historical city offering flights back to bangalore which we have to go through anyway (i think!) to get a flight to colombo (sri lanka) where wedding would start.
(day 8-14)
once we fly into colombo, the initial west coastal travel (negombo to galle) occurs during the 27th to 2nd (as part of the wedding). the transfer would be with wedding guests and takes about 3 hours via private bus.
(day 15-16)
post-wedding, leave from galle to explore the tissa area (yala safari park w/ leopards and elephants, etc. with a 3.5hr private transfer) for two days.
(day 17-19)
from there, we transfer (anywhere from 2-5 hours, depending on which city/ies we choose) to central sri lanka which is kandy/ella/nuriwaya eliya area for three days.
(day 20)
then transfer (~3-4 hours depending on start point) to colombo/flight to bangalore/flight home.

so, if you're not staying in blr, don't fly into there. secondly madurai is on the visit list primarily for the meenakshi temple [spoiler alert - if you are a foreigner you won't be allowed to view meenakshi]. madurai has no shopping of note, and if you plan to leave your hotel grounds, it is not place to ""chill"". nyet.

kochi is a very ordinary industrial indian city. nothing nice about it at all. nyet.
fort cochin on the other hand, is well worth a couple of days.

nah. assuming normality, you can get direct flights to cmb from cok.
so - how to reshape your plan?
fly into cok, transfer immediately to fort cochin. a couple of days in fort cochin.
drive to chertala - stay at  or drive to murinjapuzha and stay at  a couple of days at either
drive to alleppey for two nights on board your houseboat - either  or 
disembark and travel to cok for your flight to cmb.

thank much helpful information. good see destination expert many places eastern india. honor gain position diversified country. keep good work help traveler :)
yes, guessed online booking checking website. hardly priest/panda :( visited kamakhya temple times.
we seen shorter queue nrs.500/- ticket earlier visits. shorter queue hardly maximum hours darshan, thus interested shorter queue time reach delhi day late evening connecting flight. earlier visits, happily whole day time normal queue issues.
is numbers priest/panda forum ? know, could purchase ticket advance (one day earlier evening) tomorrow's morning darshan, whole issue solved :)
day 1
we land gau 12:45 standard clearing airport, expecting airport 14:15. so, reach city 16:00 hotel check fresh, cab kamakhya try reach 18:00.
now main concern is, purchase special darshan ticket nrs.500/- day evening day morning darshan, book afternoon flight gau del, believe finish darshan lately 09:30 day special entrance.
alternatively, day2 morning, reach temple early 05:00 stand queue purchasing special entrance ticket, hand need sure everything works way thought.
any help highly appreciated.
thank much time support.
deepak.","hi bornav,
thank you so much for your helpful information. it is very good to see you as destination expert of so many places of eastern india. it is very honor to gain such position in diversified country. keep up the good work and help traveler like us :)
yes, we also guessed there isn't online booking for this after checking their website. we hardly know any priest/panda :( although we have visited kamakhya temple few times.
we have seen the shorter queue of nrs.500/- ticket in our earlier visits. this shorter queue will hardly take maximum of 1 hours for darshan, thus interested on this shorter queue this time as we have to reach delhi same day by late evening for our connecting flight. in our earlier visits, we happily give whole day of time in normal queue without any issues.
is there anyway we can get the numbers of some priest/panda through this forum ? if we can just know, if we could purchase that ticket in advance (one day earlier evening) for tomorrow's morning darshan, then our whole issue is solved :)
day 1
we will land gau at around 12:45 and after standard clearing at airport, expecting to be out from airport at around 14:15. if so, we may reach city at around 16:00 and after hotel check in and fresh, we can take cab to kamakhya and try to reach there at around 18:00.
now our main concern is, if we can purchase that special darshan ticket of nrs.500/- in day 1 evening for day 2 morning darshan, we can book the afternoon flight from gau to del, as we believe we can finish the darshan lately by 09:30 on day 2 with that special entrance.
alternatively, on day2 morning, we can reach temple as early as 05:00 and stand on queue for purchasing special entrance ticket, however before hand we just need to be sure on everything that it works the same way we thought.

travel experience. i booked a ticket thru goibibo to fly on air india from bengaluru to sanfrancisco in feb'2020 for flying in april'20. due to covid-19 all international flights of air india were cancelled from march'25th. considering the situation i approached goibibo umpteen times to cancel and refund amount paid for the air ticket. no one has bothered to respond to either my emails or calls as of date. the helpdesk and chat services are of no use. i sent a email to the group chairman of makemytrip who also oversees operations of goibibo. there has been no response from him too. it is one year and fate of my refund amount is unknown.a legal notice has been sent to goibibo seeking refund. they have not bothered to respond to this either. i plan to take the issue to national consumer forum to help me out. i urge all not to use the service of goibibo. looks like they are a fly by night operating company with no business ethics. i have learnt lessons the hard way with this interaction. looks like goibibo have made their money during nation wide lockdown last year and sitting pretty on cash. moral of the story never book your travel plans with a online portal like

we booked birmingham because it was cheaper than all of the other uk airports (especially manchester)

problematic, weather-wise, depending on what you are used to. this is summer in india, on the northern plains - that is, agra, delhi and jaipur - you should expect maximum temperatures regularly in the very high 30s c. varanasi, if anything, is slightly hotter in april.
>> that should give us 16-17 days <<
my rough rule of thumb is 3 nights everywhere. in planning you should understand that land transport in india is desperately slow. travelling overnight by train adds a layer of efficiency - leave one city and wake up in your next destination. under no circumstances should you consider travelling by car+driver inter-city at night. flights are clearly faster, however the short haul flights in india don't offer the benefit when you factor in the long and time consuming identity and security checks, and the traffic to get to and from the airport at either end.
essentially you have 3 options for making the bookings whilst outside of the country. and you will need to book in advance.
irctc:  this is the gold standard for railways bookings. you need to create an account.
 does not carry all trains, and charges a premium on the ticket price.

on the availability and cost side of things, i noticed there was a lot of availability for flight pairings around the same price, 310 seemed to be about the average, for most of august and other months. the tickets are also available through other platforms eg. google flights but (imo) it's always better to book direct for a few reasons - easier to communicate with, less hassle, benefits in loyalty program etc.

it’s rather odd that there is no quarantine hotel provision at manchester airport, because, for example, a scheduled qatar airways flight from doha landed this evening at 20.31 bst... and a ryanair flight from tenerife is due to land at 22.18 hrs...
its also odd that when people are booking their quarantine hotel, they can express a “ preference “ concerning food, but it is only a “ preference” and cannot be guaranteed, so people who follow a particular dietary regime for religious or other cultural/ medical reasons could have significant problems,
same with people with disabilities... they can ask for, say, a disability adapted or wheelchair friendly room, but can’t be sure of getting one.
i can see the newspaper headlines in a few days time when people who are already p1ssed off at having to pay for their own virtual incarceration, find that their particular and important needs have been ignored...

i'm hoping i can still grab it at hk airport where it'll be much cheaper, but i'm going to be entering via boat into the restricted area in t1. it doesn't look like many shops are open at present (
does anyone know if relay would sell apple products, or if there would be anywhere else beyond security / any other way i can get apple products from within t1? i've tried reaching out to them but no joy, so wondering if anyone has local knowledge / recent experience.
many thanks!",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g294217-i1496-k13574260-Buying_Apple_Products_HK_Airport_Entering_at_Skypier-Hong_Kong.html,Buying Apple Products @ HK Airport (Entering at Skypier),David E,CN,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidellis87?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,200,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,50,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,50,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,50,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,27500,"[""['guy',"", ""'niche',"", ""'request',"", ""'week',"", ""'shenzhen',"", ""'hk',"", ""'airport',"", ""'flight',"", ""'t1',"", ""'die',"", ""'hk',"", ""'months',"", ""'buy',"", ""'apple',"", ""'products',"", ""'iphone',"", ""'apple',"", ""'watch',"", ""'hop',"", ""'grab',"", ""'hk',"", ""'airport',"", ""'itll',"", ""'much',"", ""'cheaper',"", ""'enter',"", ""'via',"", ""'boat',"", ""'restrict',"", ""'area',"", ""'t1',"", ""'many',"", ""'shop',"", ""'open',"", ""'present',"", ""'relay',"", ""'sell',"", ""'apple',"", ""'products',"", ""'beyond',"", ""'security',"", ""'way',"", ""'apple',"", ""'products',"", ""'t1',"", ""'try',"", ""'reach',"", ""'joy',"", ""'wonder',"", ""'local',"", ""'knowledge',"", ""'recent',"", ""'experience',"", ""'many']""]",False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

as an overall experience, emirates would be the winner for most folk though. it's just more rounded on more levels e.g. lounge vs lounge, ife, wine list, cabin decor, service level etc. safe bet all round i'd say, especially as etihad have announced plans to go more midscale, cutback etc. add into the equation going via auh is a workaround too far for many and carries a bit more risk, which is why i'd easily so go for emirates.
ek are significantly cheaper, but ask yourself why. it's a shame emirates won't have brought in premium economy by the time you're flying as that could make the comparisons very interesting.
all comes down to what your priority is though canny lad - convenience, cost, experience, reassurance etc.

was just wondering if anyone has previously taken the etihad shuttle from abu dhabi airport to dubai and what their thoughts were...? is it convenient or a bit of a hassle? i realise it’s about 80 mins but was wondering if there are big queues, wait times to board etc. looking at flights and etihad is considerably cheaper than other airlines but we do have a 5 hour journey to our departure airport so just weighing up the pros and cons.
thanks in advance,

i also understand that the koh samui airport is privately owned by bangkok airways, which presumably prevents other airlines being allowed to land there ?",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g293916-i3687-k13463121-Possible_Christmas_trip-Bangkok.html,Possible Christmas trip,David R,UK,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DavidR13966?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,100,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,100.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,100,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,30000,"[""['15',"", ""'domestic',"", ""'flight',"", ""'direct',"", ""'samui',"", ""'cheap',"", ""'operate',"", ""'bangkok',"", ""'airways',"", ""'indeed',"", ""'domestic',"", ""'flight',"", ""'bkk',"", ""'koh',"", ""'samui',"", ""'expensive',"", ""'due',"", ""'bangkok',"", ""'airways',"", ""'monopoly',"", ""'route',"", ""'koh',"", ""'samui',"", ""'airport',"", ""'privately',"", ""'bangkok',"", ""'airways',"", ""'presumably',"", ""'prevent',"", ""'airlines',"", ""'allow',"", ""'land']""]",False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

then far 'wriggle room' a) price drop - standard room available across places, thus chance drop - b) easier negotiate upsell check-in da package. believe me, gh able refuse option 'ancillary revenue' case missing group yours, given current economy.

going anantara, look discovery loyalty program offers attractive it? 50 usd, could sign business travel subscription, program free offers discounts benefits select properties. worth pop perhaps?

i *think* what i'd do - if you're not tied to booking a package that is - is perhaps book the room w/o the hb/da either ro or b&b, probably just the basic room only perhaps. this way, that's the 'bog standard' option and easier to compare/track across more sales channels (websites/agents etc.) similarly, you can also pruvo as mentioned before to keep track of price drops.
then you've far more 'wriggle room' to get a) a price drop - as the standard room will be available across more places, thus more chance to drop - and b) easier to negotiate an upsell even at check-in for the da package. believe me, even gh won't be able to refuse the option of 'ancillary revenue' if it's a case of missing out on a group like yours, especially given the current economy.
if any of them mention the expo word, ignore them.
going back to the anantara, did you look into if the discovery loyalty program offers were attractive for it? for about 50 usd, you could sign up to business travel subscription, get the program free and it offers discounts and benefits at select properties. worth a pop perhaps?

tbh, i can't even see you been allowed to board your flight in saudi arabia, as you do not have the entry requirements needed to enter both india or thailand.
you may not plan to enter the country, but since your flights are all single tickets cobbled together, you have no choice in the matter. you will be required to go thru immigration in both countries to check in for your next flight, which means you will need to have all the required documents needed to enter that country...

jump on the metro and get a ticket to the marina - you'll get a good view of the city (its long and thin) on route to the marina (you'll see the burj khalifa, burj al arab on the way down). you could have a little wander around the newest part of the city - then grab a taxi to jumeirah madinat and have a wander through the jumeirah 'souk' - costa coffee for a good view of the burj al arab and a refreshment break.
walk through to al qasr hotel to catch a cab to the palace hotel - walk around the fountain (last show is at 11pm i think so you may want to catch it). see the burj khalifa up close and personal. grab a bite to eat in the mall and then taxi back to the airport.
you'll need to allow an hour to get out of the airport and then whatever your airline suggests to get back in. if your flight is delayed, maybe just get the metro to mall of emirates and taxi to madinat (miss out the marina).

just seen it this morning and i’m fuming!
i bought a ticket with qatar and will be leaving friday night but i’m not sure how much ££ i’m going to get back from emirates (i’m literally just about to cancel the flight with them as the flight we had booked was with a 20h wait in dublin). we didn’t know if our options would diminish or increase so took the leap and booked with qatar to be on the safe side.
we have been stretching ourselves massively (this is our 6th week in dubai) and we need to get home as we have a building refurbishment going on and we miss our two dogs more than anything.
it’s done now for us, but great catch on your flight back!
take care.

edited: 6:40 am, 24,","well, nuance is your friend here. the traffic light system and the fcdo are two different things, think of the tl as more reflective of covid protection whereas the fcdo is *always* the more important measure, not least when it comes to things like insurance, if agents will refund, if airlines will cancel etc.
my tip *always* is in situations like this is to put a formal written request in to the directors of your travel providers at their registered business address and ask what your options are. the trick is to write is as informed as possible, without coming across as 'entitled' or 'karen' about things, but to let them know you know your rights and what the cma are saying especially w.r.t. refunds. this may seem a lot of work, but a large part of the problems people in these situations face is speaking to the customer-facing staff or sales staff, many of whom are just toeing the company line.
only then when you know what you know what your available options, as opposed to what someone may be saying, can you then decide what to do.
one of the main issues with a provider keeping your funds is you lose the flexibility of choice, especially if they uplift prices. at least with cash back in hand, you're free to choose who to book with and for how much.
regarding fcdo advice, as a *general* rule of thumb, if it's not with your situation that will often mean an airline will cancel a flight or a provider/agent may cancel. there's also the situation like last year, where some flights were still going but despite government restrictions, travellers shouldn't go on holiday and then it's a 'blinking competition with agents to get them to refund (some may even just refund/agree on day before travel)
the government, at least shappo, have made a rod for their own back with their lack of clarity about refund rights and the truth is, it will be 'hit and miss' and each provider will adopt their own stance.
this is why it's important to get your options on the table as it stands now - especially when it's in your favour in terms of tl and fcdo advice - and then you can decide from there.
in my own opinion, it's clear uk gov/shappo are doing whatever they can to discourage travel on the whole, and especially to dubai/uae (reputation management being the driver i feel) so it won't be clear for at least a couple of tl reviews (ie 6/7 jun then 3 weeks on) before we get any indication of the lie of the land.
from this forum alone, eh seemed to play hardball a lot over the pandemic - they weren't always upfront about t&c, for instance hiding them from their website at one time - and given the financial constraints of the group (likely needing another bailout) would suggest a refund would likely be slow. on the upside, they'll always be able to get you to dubai but the issue will likely be the cost. as for getting back, even if flights are still banned they'd just send you indirect, so you'll still get a holiday (if you decide you really want to go)

i couldn't agree more. there is definatley a political element to it and by all accounts shapps has backed himself into corner and others suffer just because he can't seen to lose face.
i also venture it got as much do where its a hub to and from as anything else - that is moot at the moment given the uae's moratoruim on flights to high risk areas as anything to do with protocols at the airports themselves. there is little logic to hub argument and that will diminish further when eventually other countries and destination open up to uk nationals.

before you go about cancelling, please clarify what you are entitled to. airlines have a range of flexible options, and you benefit from being a direct customer, but rarely do they offer a refund if you cancel unless you have an expensive refundable ticket.
i know people have said things about getting refunds and those things can be interpreted in different ways, but i simply urge you to check just what it is you are likely to get back.
good luck.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g295424-i872-k13517529-UAE_green_list_possibility-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html,UAE green list possibility?,swans40,UK,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/swans40?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,100,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,100,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,20000,"[""['moses',"", ""'cancel',"", ""'clarify',"", ""'entitle',"", ""'airlines',"", ""'range',"", ""'flexible',"", ""'options',"", ""'benefit',"", ""'direct',"", ""'customer',"", ""'rarely',"", ""'refund',"", ""'cancel',"", ""'expensive',"", ""'refundable',"", ""'ticket',"", ""'people',"", ""'refund',"", ""'interpret',"", ""'different',"", ""'ways',"", ""'simply',"", ""'urge',"", ""'good']""]",False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

i know i’m a bit ahead of the game here, and prices are not even out yet for my dates, but i’m trying to start planning for a trip for june or july 2022. we will be coming from the u.s. and planning on booking a few days by the marina and last 2 nights at the atlantis hotel.
my question is when should i buy airfare tickets, should i buy when they come out with june or july dates or would you recommend waiting a few months and buying tickets maybe towards the end of 2021 or beginning of 2022.

a good idea what the average price will be for such a trip. current prices may be influenced by the lack of covid traveling. i recently did jump on some airfares for my family trip this june. i saw turkish airways had a business class promotion for a bit under 3k rt with a short istanbul stop out of atlanta. also consider it may save quite a bit to book a separate ticket to your us departure airport on a different airline than whoever your dubai carrier partners with. take into account leaving enough time to recheck your bags from dubai departure city. personally i would focus on emirates, qatar, and turkish airways as they are either direct from us or offer short connections in cities on route ie istanbul and doha. etihad also has direct flights to abu dhabi from us but i have never checked where their price was lower than the others. last trip we took emirates out of ny but turkish out of atlanta this time was much cheaper and a bit more convenient. also liked the fact turkish was using their 787-9s with their new business class seating out of atl while new york was flying the older 777er seating. a few hours extra in ist shouldn’t be a problem due to their world class business class lounge to pass the time but do pay attention to how much connection times add to the already long trip. all in all if something appears to good to pass up, i wouldn’t, in hopes of something a bit better.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g295424-i872-k13513432-Visiting_Dubai_2022-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html,Visiting Dubai

i helps.","late in returning - sun shining in the uk, been out on my bike.
looks like it's been solved, but to sum it up and the way i see it:
firstly you may get away with it at check in, but i doubt you want to risk this. i can assure you it is a bit nerve racking. i have flown to thailand many times and even as a frequent flyer, silver status, etc i usually get quizzed re return or onward ticket (poot)' note, i did not say that this applied for se asian regional travel, but only ex uk.
the proper option is get a single entry tourist visa, but these are pretty expensive in the uk. they have introduced what they call an e-visa, but it is not, it is an e-application, you then take or post your passport to the embassy in london or cardiff. malvern to london is £££, return secure posting is £20ish. add this to the £30 visa.
a common ruse is to buy a cheap airticket. browse budget airline websites like airasia and find the cheapest single within 30 days of first arrival - usually to cambodia. buy this, show to airline at check in and then throw it away after you get to thailand. you could get a more expensive refundable ticket, but refunds can be slow and problematic.

i would have thought anyone travelling in business attire would be an immediate red flag - who even does that - - i used to travel regularly for business and the business travellers were usually the scruffiest of all the passengers
it’s quite simple - there’s no chance of foreign holidays from the uk before 17th may unless you’re an entitled **** who bucks the system
after that it’s down to whatever our government decide and whatever the destination country decide - so not terribly predictable right now but entirely possibly as all sides have an interstellar in things getting back to ‘normal’ asap

and it’s true, if something goes wrong, no one at tk cares. you forget something in the plane: consider it gone for good.
i agree it can be stressful to change planes in frankfurt. munich is much better. though at lh they do take care of you and your luggage in case of missed connections.
a stopover in dubai would be my last choice as both flights are too short to sleep and the waiting time in the middle of the night in dubai is dreadful.
as to in flight service i can only talk about business class:
turkish: very good, spacious but no partition to neighbor

the hand baggage maybe allowed in the incoming flight , from africa, but it will not be the case with the next flight that i plan to take from dubai.....which is why i can't continue on as hand baggage !

i just spent 2 weeks in us and returned to hk last month. i learned the lesson a painful way regarding covid-19 test. why? i took both walgreens and cvs tests 72 hr prior to my departure date/time and printed them out for airlines check in staff. then they rejected my test results because i can't proof if these results do not have the clia (cms) nor iso 15189 certificate. at the end, i missed my flight and i had so much trouble after..... long story short... i had a very painful experience making my way back, including paying for $275 at airport for the test, rebooking quarantine hotel in hk, rebooking my flight, paying for airport hotel room.
anyways, after returned to hk, during these 14 days at quarantine hotel, i found out walgreens' test result has a lob name and address printed. what you need to do is to google or even call the lob. for example, i googled the lab (lab corp)+ clia as key words. i had the following link

if i had google this lab before, i could have save $2000 usd!
hope this helps.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g294217-i1496-k13549873-Does_CVS_COVID_Test_report_have_CLIA-Hong_Kong.html,Does CVS COVID Test report have CLIA#?,Wan F,"Mesa, Arizona",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wanchaiferry?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,50,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,50,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,200,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,50,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,50,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,50,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,200,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,52500,"[""['people',"", ""'spend',"", ""'2',"", ""'weeks',"", ""'hk',"", ""'month',"", ""'learn',"", ""'lesson',"", ""'painful',"", ""'way',"", ""'covid',"", ""'19',"", ""'test',"", ""'walgreens',"", ""'cvs',"", ""'test',"", ""'72',"", ""'hr',"", ""'prior',"", ""'departure',"", ""'date',"", ""'time',"", ""'print',"", ""'airlines',"", ""'staff',"", ""'reject',"", ""'test',"", ""'proof',"", ""'clia',"", ""'cms',"", ""'iso',"", ""'15189',"", ""'certificate',"", ""'end',"", ""'miss',"", ""'flight',"", ""'much',"", ""'trouble',"", ""'long',"", ""'story',"", ""'short',"", ""'painful',"", ""'experience',"", ""'way',"", ""'include',"", ""'pay',"", ""'275',"", ""'airport',"", ""'test',"", ""'rebooking',"", ""'quarantine',"", ""'hotel',"", ""'hk',"", ""'rebooking',"", ""'flight',"", ""'pay',"", ""'airport',"", ""'hotel',"", ""'room',"", ""'anyways',"", ""'hk',"", ""'14',"", ""'days',"", ""'quarantine',"", ""'hotel',"", ""'walgreens',"", ""'test',"", ""'lob',"", ""'name',"", ""'address',"", ""'print',"", ""'google',"", ""'call',"", ""'lob',"", ""'example',"", ""'google',"", ""'lab',"", ""'lab',"", ""'corp',"", ""'clia',"", ""'key',"", ""'word',"", ""'link',"", ""'google',"", ""'lab',"", ""'save',"", ""'2000',"", ""'usd',"", ""'help']""]",False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

edited: 2:28 pm, august 05,","that is common. there's ""unauthorized"" booking sites that sell emirates flights and the ticket number will not have the numbers beginning with 176. if you purchase an emirates airline ticket on their website or an authorized travel site, it should start with the numbers 176.
the same applies for qatar airways tickets that need to start with a certain number to be able to join their stopover programs when it's available.
so, basically, just purchase off the emirates site and you won't have any issues. i booked my ticket a month ago and it comes with insurance and it starts with the numbers 176.

i've spoken insurance cover incase something goes wrong travel work related.","i'm so confused now.
my travel is booked for mid february.
before anyone bombards me with,why am i travelling, its business related travel.
i have kept postponing my plans and this time i need to go.
im a registered property company in uk and am investing in dubai.
therefore viewing those properties now is important.
obviously i was still going to enjoy the sun and sea outside my meeting times perhaps by the pool or balcony.
but with the spike in dubai, im also afraid. but also at the same time here in uk is similar with infection rates too..
should i be worried to travel?
i've spoken to insurance and it does cover me incase something goes wrong because my travel is work related.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g295424-i872-k13473641-Current_Infection_rate-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html,Current Infection rate,RouseysTravels,UK,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RouseysTravels?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,50,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,50,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,200,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,50,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,50,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,50,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,32500,"[""['confuse',"", ""'travel',"", ""'book',"", ""'mid',"", ""'february',"", ""'bombard',"", ""'withwhy',"", ""'travel',"", ""'business',"", ""'relate',"", ""'travel',"", ""'keep',"", ""'postpone',"", ""'plan',"", ""'time',"", ""'register',"", ""'property',"", ""'company',"", ""'uk',"", ""'invest',"", ""'dubai',"", ""'therefore',"", ""'view',"", ""'properties',"", ""'important',"", ""'obviously',"", ""'sun',"", ""'sea',"", ""'outside',"", ""'meet',"", ""'time',"", ""'pool',"", ""'balcony',"", ""'spike',"", ""'dubai',"", ""'afraid',"", ""'time',"", ""'uk',"", ""'similar',"", ""'infection',"", ""'rat',"", ""'worry',"", ""'travel',"", ""'speak',"", ""'insurance',"", ""'cover',"", ""'incase',"", ""'something',"", ""'wrong',"", ""'travel',"", ""'work',"", ""'relate']""]",False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

edited: 5:03 am, march 07,","#18 the ba flight is now a b787. still not as good as the a350 but a damn sight better than the b777. a valid warning about ensuring flexibility of the ticket, but i think most airlines are now allowing free changes.

they have said we cant cancel and have the funds we placed now unless emirates cancel or we can change with new pricing to somewhere else , ive ony paid out so far around 1500 ( 2 people ) so not bad if i need to change. but with all that is going on id rather have the money now.
with the first on that route dubai to cape what are those seats like as im thinking we should have just stuck with business but the rate i got would be cheaper than changing now back down to biz . i dont want to really mention the name of the agent as they have been very helpful compared , do you think i have any argument now to get the money back , we are not due to travel until 15 dec and it was peak time coming back just before new year so poss highest price of the year but super cheap tickets 7k for the two of us return first class from manchester a380 start of trip then the older plane but all the extras etc.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g295424-i872-k13474445-Emirates_business_class_upgrades-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html,Emirates business class upgrades,lovedogs1234,AU,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lovedogs1234?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,200,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,50,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,50,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,50,50,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,50,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,32500,"[""['longton',"", ""'honest',"", ""'trip',"", ""'ahead',"", ""'honest',"", ""'anymore',"", ""'agent',"", ""'move',"", ""'choice',"", ""'autum',"", ""'free',"", ""'charge',"", ""'suppose',"", ""'travel',"", ""'nov',"", ""'2020',"", ""'cancel',"", ""'fund',"", ""'place',"", ""'emirates',"", ""'cancel',"", ""'new',"", ""'price',"", ""'ony',"", ""'pay',"", ""'far',"", ""'1500',"", ""'2',"", ""'people',"", ""'bad',"", ""'money',"", ""'route',"", ""'dubai',"", ""'cape',"", ""'seat',"", ""'stick',"", ""'business',"", ""'rate',"", ""'cheaper',"", ""'biz',"", ""'name',"", ""'agent',"", ""'helpful',"", ""'argument',"", ""'money',"", ""'due',"", ""'travel',"", ""'15',"", ""'dec',"", ""'peak',"", ""'time',"", ""'new',"", ""'poss',"", ""'highest',"", ""'price',"", ""'super',"", ""'cheap',"", ""'ticket',"", ""'7k',"", ""'two',"", ""'class',"", ""'manchester',"", ""'a380',"", ""'start',"", ""'trip',"", ""'older',"", ""'plane',"", ""'extras']""]",False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

2. non direct easy pear shaped delay involved lots delays tons rescheduling going right next year , book today could easily change , need allow baggage transferred plane boarding gate next flight - distance travelling chaotic . need see flight delayed next due airline responsibility fall cost . ie new flight . im sure many fly day amsterdam .
are qatar flying dubai previously changed..
i never allow flying dubai jfk catch domestic - hour could hour vacate immigration landing , id instead journey look cheap stay local jfk - going hell distance dog tired running end prob catch last flight.
ive done tons flying states domestic v international different ball game .","both miami and jfk are very busy airports esp for international travelers and when flying large planes with many passengers and of course you have all the immigration to go through - very different to a us domestic flight so in my humble opinion i would be considering the following points for such a long journey.
1. direct is always more expensive because their is such little risk and even if delayed you will still get to your destination.
2. non direct is very easy to go pear shaped if any delay is involved and their are lots of delays and tons of rescheduling going on right now until next year , so what you book today could very easily change , you will need to allow baggage to be transferred from one plane to another and then get to the boarding gate for the next flight - for me for the distance you are travelling that would be to chaotic . also you need to see if a flight is delayed when is the next one due out and is it the airline responsibility or would it fall to you to cost it . ie a new flight . im not sure how many fly each day maybe only one from amsterdam .
are qatar now flying into dubai as they were not previously although i think that may have changed..
i would never allow flying from dubai to jfk to then catch a domestic - 1 hour it could take a hour to vacate go through immigration from landing , id instead for that journey look at a cheap stay local to jfk - your going one hell of a distance and you will be dog tired to then be running around at the end to prob not catch that very last flight.

edited: 6:07 am, january 05,","it’s personal preference. if flying premium or business then an overnight flight isn’t bad as you can gain a day and this can be advantageous on the return journey also as you get home earlier however if in economy you’ll get next to no sleep and will be like a nodding dog the following afternoon
personally if you have several choices of flight available and the night flight is significantly cheaper then go for it but if there’s little difference in price i’d do the afternoon flight and you’ll get a proper nights sleep ready to start your holiday.

i have a bunch of alaska airlines miles, and it's been a dream of mine to use some for what i consider one of the greatest air award redemptions available: 70k alaska miles to fly cathay first class from the usa to hong kong, stopover as long as i want, and then continue on in business class to south africa.
what i'm planning on doing is flying from the usa to hk in early march, and then transiting immediately to another cathay flight to taiwan where i will meet some friends. this is not allowed under current rules since the cathay flights would be on separate tickets. then after some time in taiwan and the philippines, i plan to fly back to hong kong, spend a few days there, and then take my flight to south africa.
i already have booked the hk to taiwan flight. i'm planning on booking the usa-hk-south africa flights in the next couple of months. the philippines stuff i can wait on as i figure it is the most dodgy (in terms of hong kong letting me in).
what do you guys think? am i crazy? it would only cost me a couple hundred us$s to undo the awards, so no huge financial penalty if i can't make it. but my friends already have their flights booked to taiwan, nonstop from usa via eva. so i'd have to scramble to figure out how to get there. then again, taiwan isn't open for tourists right now either so who knows lol.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g294217-i1496-k13510575-Am_I_crazy_for_planning_this_currently_not_allowed_trip-Hong_Kong.html,Am I crazy for planning this (currently not allowed) trip?,bfwolf35805,US,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bfwolf35805?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,300,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,134.0,300,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,300,0,0,300,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,128978,"[""['curious',"", ""'crazy',"", ""'people',"", ""'plan',"", ""'trip',"", ""'2022',"", ""'receive',"", ""'dose',"", ""'pfizer',"", ""'vaccine',"", ""'btw',"", ""'fully',"", ""'vaccinate',"", ""'bunch',"", ""'alaska',"", ""'airlines',"", ""'miles',"", ""'dream',"", ""'one',"", ""'greatest',"", ""'air',"", ""'award',"", ""'redemptions',"", ""'70k',"", ""'alaska',"", ""'miles',"", ""'fly',"", ""'cathay',"", ""'class',"", ""'usa',"", ""'hong',"", ""'kong',"", ""'stopover',"", ""'long',"", ""'continue',"", ""'business',"", ""'class',"", ""'south',"", ""'africa',"", ""'plan',"", ""'fly',"", ""'usa',"", ""'hk',"", ""'early',"", ""'march',"", ""'transit',"", ""'immediately',"", ""'cathay',"", ""'flight',"", ""'taiwan',"", ""'meet',"", ""'friends',"", ""'allow',"", ""'current',"", ""'rule',"", ""'cathay',"", ""'flight',"", ""'separate',"", ""'ticket',"", ""'time',"", ""'taiwan',"", ""'philippines',"", ""'plan',"", ""'fly',"", ""'hong',"", ""'kong',"", ""'spend',"", ""'days',"", ""'flight',"", ""'south',"", ""'africa',"", ""'book',"", ""'hk',"", ""'taiwan',"", ""'flight',"", ""'plan',"", ""'book',"", ""'usa',"", ""'hk',"", ""'south',"", ""'africa',"", ""'flight',"", ""'couple',"", ""'months',"", ""'philippines',"", ""'stuff',"", ""'wait',"", ""'figure',"", ""'dodgy',"", ""'term',"", ""'hong',"", ""'kong',"", ""'guy',"", ""'crazy',"", ""'cost',"", ""'couple',"", ""'hundred',"", ""'uss',"", ""'undo',"", ""'award',"", ""'huge',"", ""'financial',"", ""'penalty',"", ""'friends',"", ""'flight',"", ""'book',"", ""'taiwan',"", ""'nonstop',"", ""'usa',"", ""'via',"", ""'eva',"", ""'scramble',"", ""'figure',"", ""'taiwan',"", ""'isnt',"", ""'open',"", ""'tourists',"", ""'right']""]",False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

no comment as to why now and not 10 months ago...horse - bolted.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g295424-i872-k13466639-All_arrivals_to_UK_face_hotel_quarantine_The_Times-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html,All arrivals to UK face hotel quarantine - The Times,dg33,UK,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dg33dubai?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,100,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,100,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,20000,"[""['pay',"", ""'monthly',"", ""'business',"", ""'trip',"", ""'dubai',"", ""'true',"", ""'extension',"", ""'risk',"", ""'survival',"", ""'business',"", ""'happy',"", ""'comply',"", ""'quarantine',"", ""'rule',"", ""'stay',"", ""'home',"", ""'fortunate',"", ""'able',"", ""'work',"", ""'home',"", ""'uk',"", ""'detail',"", ""'whether',"", ""'uk',"", ""'nationals',"", ""'visitors',"", ""'date',"", ""'instigate',"", ""'comment',"", ""'10',"", ""'months',"", ""'agohorse',"", ""'bolt']""]",False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

this access cheap fares - hk$2 bus, ferry mtr journeys. hand airport customer service desk way deposit remaining credit (less small handling fee). buy cards machine airport using credit card, refund end hk$ cash, guess coffee onward flight something.
you plenty time lantau/buddha/tai trip bus almost cost. flights airline bags checked boarding passes onward flight need airport 45-60 minutes flight,
edited: 8:23 am, 03,","if you are in your 70s you should simply each get an standard on-loan elder octopus card.

this will give you access to very cheap fares - hk$2 for most bus, ferry and mtr journeys. you can hand it back at the airport customer service desk on your way out and get your deposit and any remaining credit back (less a small handling fee). you can buy the cards from a machine at the airport using a credit card, but the refund at the end will be in hk$ cash, which i guess you can use on a coffee before your onward flight or something.
you should have plenty of time to do the lantau/buddha/tai o trip by bus for almost no cost. if your flights are on the same airline then all your bags and stuff will be checked through and you will have your boarding passes for the onward flight so you only need to get back to the airport 45-60 minutes before your flight,

this is a great move, 10 months late, and should make some people think twice before they break the law and travel to dubai under the current lockdown.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g295424-i872-k13460797-ALL_o_s_travellers_to_England_now_need_neg_test_72_hrs-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html,ALL o/s travellers to England now need neg test (72 hrs),Shaun C,UK,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shaunclark99?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,50,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,50,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,50,0,200,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,200,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,47500,"[""['26',"", ""'allow',"", ""'board',"", ""'flight',"", ""'uk',"", ""'uk',"", ""'test',"", ""'positive',"", ""'72',"", ""'hours',"", ""'flight',"", ""'uk',"", ""'simple',"", ""'read',"", ""'travel',"", ""'insurance',"", ""'invalid',"", ""'may',"", ""'pocket',"", ""'dubais',"", ""'problem',"", ""'short',"", ""'time',"", ""'specific',"", ""'detail',"", ""'stay',"", ""'thatll',"", ""'become',"", ""'clear',"", ""'days',"", ""'move',"", ""'10',"", ""'months',"", ""'late',"", ""'people',"", ""'twice',"", ""'break',"", ""'law',"", ""'travel',"", ""'dubai',"", ""'current',"", ""'lockdown']""]",False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

thank !!","hi eveyrone !! need an advice on which hotel is best to choose from this selection for 14 days business trip!
there are several packages for members so here we go:
al bandar creek
sheraton grand szr
sofitel downtown
budget is about 1500$ for the hotel only.
this is a business trip where i’ll have to visit several offices in a trade center and karama districts.
all hotels are in the same price range. so if going for conrad szr, it will be much more expensive already!
obviously, sheraton grand is the most convinient option.
it has plenty of inexpensive restaurants and a subway station nearby.
however, al bandar is a decent option as well. it offers half board for the same price and it’s still not so far from everything. yes, it’s located in dubai creek but not far if taking a taxi and there is even a deira mall nearby.
sofitel downtown seems to be the most popular hotel among those three. it’s in close proximity to dubai mall, has a nice swimming pool. what do you think?
what’s the best option here in terms of overall quality, rooms, food, service etc. ?

347,5780,HK,"** suggestions based situation covid **
half day trip macau unrealistic - total round trip traffic 3-4 hours already. full day feasible.
also, consider flying macau singapore / bangkok, stay night two macau early hmz bus hong kong morning flight. logistic easier. comment south east asia part familiar there.
or taking eva air following merits
- open jaw ticket allows arriving hong kong leaving yyz macau (both transit taiwan)
- free stopover taiwan (depends fare rules), yyz- tpe transit - hkg + macau - khh (make way tpe) tpe - yyz week so
anyway, international travel normalized 2022.
edited: 11:54 am, february 28,","** any suggestions below are based on the situation that is without the covid **
half day trip in macau is just unrealistic - the total round trip traffic itself can take you 3-4 hours already. a full day is more feasible.
also, you may consider flying to macau from singapore / bangkok, stay a night or two in macau and take the early hmz bus to hong kong for the morning flight. that should make the logistic easier. no comment on the south east asia part as not familiar with there.
or you may also think of taking eva air with the following merits
- you can have open jaw ticket that allows you arriving at hong kong and leaving to yyz from macau (both with one transit in taiwan)
- free stopover at taiwan (depends on the fare rules), say yyz- tpe transit - hkg + macau - khh (make your way to tpe) tpe - yyz for a week or so
anyway, i myself do not think that international travel can be normalized even in 2022.

i can't possibly see could known requirement compliance rule. completely unfair. feel cheapoair responsible travel agency reason people problems this, informed rule today selling flights connect haneda narita right customers buy cannot use. japan airlines information website listed no-show. i'm extremely unhappy angry pass responsibility other.","i am seeking advice about what to do about a ticket that i can't get refunded or rebooked, wonder if anyone has had similar problems. i bought a ticket from cheapoair from taiwan to japan haneda with 16 hr layover then transfer to narita and then on to the us, when i got to the gate they told me i could not stay at narita overnight as i planned and that since i was transiting in japan i could not board without showing that i had booked a quartine approved hotel and transportation. they didn't have a list of such hotels, in the time that i was trying to get cheapo to book one for me the gate closed and i missed the flight. there was no way i could have known about this problem before i got into the airport, cheapoair had sent a generic email telling customers that they responsible for knowing covid regulations in the countries that they travel in, on the japan airlines website it lists the entry restrictions as:
travelers who are not entering japan and transferring directly to a third country by transit, are not required to submit any documents and undergo pcr tests.
however, the following cases require entry into japan. please be informed that foreign nationals arriving from prohibited countries will not be allowed to enter japan.
- transferring between tokyo international airport (haneda airport) and narita international airport
- travelers with a connecting flight out of narita international airport the following day
i am not entering from a prohibited country and have a negative prc test so i thought i was ok. it says nothing about a quarantine hotel or narita being closed overnight. both airports also do not mention it.
cheapoair says japan airlines marked me as a no show and i can't rebook or get a refund and that i should contact japan airlines, japan airlines says that i was marked as a no-show at the gate and can't rebook me, they tell me to contact cheapoair for a refund.
i can't possibly see how i could have known about this requirement and been in compliance with the rule. it's completely unfair. i feel like cheapoair is more responsible because they are a travel agency and the reason people use them is so that they won't have problems like this, they should have informed me of the rule and they still today are selling flights that connect from haneda to narita right now that their customers will buy but cannot use. japan airlines also should have this information on their website and also should not have listed me as a no-show. i'm extremely unhappy with both of them and very angry that they both pass off the responsibility to each other.",0,0,0,0,JP,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,225,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,225,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,400,0,0,100,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,225,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,95625,"[""['seek',"",

it much easier navigate japan signs leader boards railway bus stations english well japanese street signs many places languages
.spoken english limited. japanese children taught english school spoken english part exams (i told japanese teacher english) students focussed need exams.
whether enjoy solo travel question personality destination.
i'm quite sure ""working time"".
if working remotely regular job, aware fast broadband ubiquitous think, check book hotels. certainly received work emails travel to, times stay inside work 1/2 day day time part plan.
if pick work japan go, need different sort visa usual tourist visa and, suspect, certain generally available skills.
don't count working illegally.
it never safe, orderly generally law abiding country strikes unwise usual,","all but one of my 6 trips to japan have been solo. one 5 1/2 week trip was solo for two of the weeks, the rest with my husband.
it is much easier to navigate japan than you would think as the signs and leader boards in the railway and bus stations are in english as well as japanese and the street signs in many places have both languages
.spoken english may be more limited. japanese children are taught english in school but spoken english is not part of the exams (i was told by a japanese teacher of english) and the students are focussed on what they need for exams.
whether you enjoy solo travel is more a question of your own personality than of your destination.
i'm not quite sure what you mean by ""working at the same time"".
if you mean working remotely at your regular job, be aware that fast broadband isn't as ubiquitous as you might think, so check before you book hotels. i have certainly received work emails when i travel and have had to, at times stay inside and work for a 1/2 day or day at a time but it has not been part of a plan.
if you mean pick up work in japan as you go, you would need a different sort of visa from the usual tourist visa and, i suspect, have certain not generally available skills.

travelers who are not entering japan and transferring directly to a third country by transit, are not required to submit any documents and undergo pcr tests.

- travelers with a connecting flight out of narita international airport the following day
i am not entering from a prohibited country and have a negative prc test so i thought i was ok. it says nothing about a quarantine hotel or narita being closed overnight. both airports also do not mention it.
cheapoair says japan airlines marked me as a no show and i can't rebook or get a refund and that i should contact japan airlines, japan airlines says that i was marked as a no-show at the gate and can't rebook me, they tell me to contact cheapoair for a refund.
i can't possibly see how i could have known about this requirement and been in compliance with the rule. it's completely unfair. i feel like cheapoair is more responsible because they are a travel agency and the reason people use them is so that they won't have problems like this, they should have informed me of the rule and they still today are selling flights that connect from haneda to narita right now that their customers will buy but cannot use. japan airlines also should have this information on their website and also should not have listed me as a no-show. i'm extremely unhappy

i also think your only channel of a possible refund is from cheapo, but the chance of them giving you anything is very slim. because you are the one who is responsible to know all the ever changing rules during this difficult covid time. and cheapo already noted that on their website when you book. it does not hurt to ask though, it may be a long shot.
jal would likely not give you a refund. for one thing, you are not their customer. cheapo is the one who paid them for a seat, which was wasted because you did not show up. jal did fly that flight.
it is widely discussed that it is the worst choice to use an online agent to book an airline ticket. all the disadvantages of using a third party reseller became very clear during the covid time when airlines cancelled flights, countries establish travel bans, etc. you just need to visit any travel forum to read about them.

the phu quoc pilot has much more chance of working in 2021 than the phuket model in 2020. visitors and locals will be vaccinated. they don't require a 30 day minimum stay. it will depend on the response from russians to the package offered.
thai airways is starting direct flights to phuket from london, paris, franfurt, copenhagen and zurich in july to september. not italy. sia doesn't fly direct to phuket from anywhere but singapore and a transit from the milan flight to a phuket flight is not allowed. of course there are no scheduled commercial services to vietnam. the government suspended them.

i completely understand and i know that i am on the outer edge of optimism in moving forward with planning! maybe i'm suffering from ""vaccination fever"" (my second shot is next week...) and can't stop myself from planning to getaway!
that said, so much is changing so fast, in every possible direction, i wanted to have things in place in case things improve for all of us. and the flexibility of many of the services (accommodation, flights) make it a little easier to extend myself since they are either refundable and/or i can convert to open tickets (as i did last year...).
that said, i'm supposed to come for a project that is decidedly site-specific. my hope is to try and include some educational travel at the same time, with the caveat that i need to be aware i might be in quarantine or not allowed to come at all.

firstly we have given a good two weeks notice so that the majority of people planning to come in from a red list country could get here before the new rule was brought in - last week there were long queues of people at airports doing just that.
secondly it's only been set up at 4 airports in england - lhr, lgw, lcy and bhx, plus farnborough for all those private jets. if you were planning to fly into man or lba for example you were meant to change your flights to one of the others, thereby leaving you miles from where you want to be when your hotel stay ends as well as costing you even more.
thirdly there seems to be no foolproof process to stop people getting round it, given they are all flying ion on flights from non red list countries.
fourthly, surely if it's dangerous to let people from red list countries into the uk without quarantine in a hotel, how is it safe to let the same people share a plane with others for however many hours?
i see that a turkish airlines flight into either edi or gla (scotland quarantining everyone that lands there) came in with a grand total of 5 passengers today. there were a further 60 booked who decided not to fly when they realised they would be quarantined. i wonder how many transferred to flights into england instead?",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g186216-i15-k13480756-Quarantine_to_cost_L1750-United_Kingdom.html,Quarantine to cost £1750,JohnEW2912,US,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JohnEW2912?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,50,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,50,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,50,0,50,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,50,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,200,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,32500,"[""['policy',"", ""'bring',"", ""'show',"", ""'something',"", ""'try',"", ""'set',"", ""'effective',"", ""'way',"", ""'stop',"", ""'variant',"", ""'covid',"", ""'case',"", ""'country',"", ""'firstly',"", ""'good',"", ""'two',"", ""'weeks',"", ""'notice',"", ""'majority',"", ""'people',"", ""'plan',"", ""'red',"", ""'country',"", ""'new',"", ""'rule',"", ""'bring',"", ""'week',"", ""'long',"", ""'queue',"", ""'people',"", ""'airports',"", ""'secondly',"", ""'set',"", ""'4',"", ""'airports',"", ""'england',"", ""'lhr',"", ""'lgw',"", ""'lcy',"", ""'bhx',"", ""'plus',"", ""'farnborough',"", ""'private',"", ""'jet',"", ""'plan',"", ""'fly',"", ""'man',"", ""'lba',"", ""'example',"", ""'flight',"", ""'one',"", ""'others',"", ""'thereby',"", ""'miles',"", ""'hotel',"", ""'stay',"", ""'end',"", ""'cost',"", ""'thirdly',"", ""'foolproof',"", ""'process',"", ""'stop',"", ""'people',"", ""'round',"", ""'fly',"", ""'ion',"", ""'flight',"", ""'non',"", ""'red',"", ""'countries',"", ""'fourthly',"", ""'surely',"", ""'dangerous',"", ""'people',"", ""'red',"", ""'countries',"", ""'uk',"", ""'quarantine',"", ""'hotel',"", ""'safe',"", ""'people',"", ""'share',"", ""'plane',"", ""'others',"", ""'many',"", ""'hours',"", ""'see',"", ""'turkish',"", ""'airlines',"", ""'flight',"", ""'edi',"", ""'gla',"", ""'scotland',"", ""'quarantine',"", ""'land',"", ""'grand',"", ""'total',"", ""'5',"", ""'passengers',"", ""'today',"", ""'60',"", ""'book',"", ""'fly',"", ""'realise',"", ""'quarantine',"", ""'wonder',"", ""'many',"", ""'transfer',"", ""'flight',"", ""'england',"", ""'instead']""]",False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

all i can suggest is you prepare for a lot of delays, have water and snacks with you and just accept it’s going to take a long time.
flying into newquay would also work, but then you have to get to your accommodation from the airport (and back again) which would realistically mean taxis. and although you can cycle and walk places, it’s always good to have the car just in case you want to go somewhere further afield.

interesting issue which i'm sure others must have faced but can't find anything out there....
we were on holiday in georgia when we heard it would go on the uk red list on 8th august. we therefore decided to cut our stay short in georgia, leaving it on the 7th, and flying to ukraine on the amber list to continue our holiday.
we are now (today) trying to fly home from ukraine but when we came to fill out the plf, and declare our week in ukraine and that we were in georgia beforehand it states we should go to a quarantine hotel.
this is not right because we left georgia before it was on red list but the plf does not seem to be clever enough to realise this from the dates.
does anyone have any advice? options seem to be to stay in ukraine for longer or lie on plf, both of which we do not want to do.
has anyone else had this issue? i can't find anything on it but presume many others must have had it of they didn't choose to go home directly when red list change was announced.
thanks

my main question whether feasible fly red list country brussels transiting via lhr two separate bookings. relevant details write below.
me wife flying mexico city (which red list) brussels via lhr. flights ba two separate tickets due fact outbound flight lhr. e.g., lhr-mexico city return trip ticket, lhr-brussels separate add-on ticket. flight brussels leaves 4hrs scheduled arrival lhr, i.e. same-day transit.
i uk resident wife (she belgian resident) means allowed lhr's immigration control per current regulation. therefore, transiting airside going immigration viable option. carry hand luggage check brussels flight online beforehand makes *in principle* proceed directly connecting flight going immigration.
but worries this:
1) mexico city-lhr-brussels trip two separate tickets: worried check-in staff mexico city airport consideration mexico city-lhr flight isolation means pre-booking quarantine hotel denied boarding wife (as non-resident). absurd given flights ba simply able confirm anyone.
2) say, able check-in online lhr-brussels flight beforehand means proper transit proof show boarding mexico city-lhr flight. somehow able board flight, need immigration lhr check-in lhr-brussels flight.
i see become lengthy post rather desperate advice much appreciated.","hello. i'm turning to the tripadvisor community after an excruciating experience of trying to clarify this with ba and heathrow - perhaps someone here has first-hand insights.
my main question is whether it is feasible to fly back from a red list country to brussels transiting via lhr with two separate bookings. there are some more relevant details which i write down below.
me and and my wife are flying back from mexico city (which is on the red list) to brussels via lhr. both flights are with ba but they are two separate tickets due to to the fact that our outbound flight is from lhr. e.g., lhr-mexico city return trip is one ticket, and lhr-brussels is a separate add-on ticket. the flight to brussels leaves 4hrs after scheduled arrival at lhr, i.e. it is same-day transit.
i am a uk resident while my wife is not (she is a belgian resident) which means she would not be allowed through lhr's immigration control as per current regulation. therefore, transiting airside without going through immigration is our only viable option. we only carry hand luggage and would check in for the brussels flight online beforehand which makes me think that *in principle* we are ok to proceed directly to the connecting flight without going through immigration.
but what worries us is this:
1) mexico city-lhr-brussels trip is two separate tickets: we are worried that the check-in staff in the mexico city airport would take into consideration the mexico city-lhr flight in isolation which means pre-booking quarantine hotel for me and a denied boarding for my wife (as she is a non-resident). this would seem absurd to me especially given that both flights are with ba but i am simply not able to confirm this with anyone.
2) say, we are not able to check-in online for the lhr-brussels flight beforehand which means we would not have a proper transit proof to show before boarding the mexico city-lhr flight. and even if we are somehow able to board that flight, we would anyway need to go through immigration at lhr to do a check-in for the lhr-brussels flight.
i see now this has become a lengthy post but we are rather desperate so any advice would be much appreciated.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g186216-i15-k13656895-Transit_from_red_list_country_through_UK_2_separate_tickets-United_Kingdom.html,Transit from red list country through UK: 2 separate tickets,11_curious_traveller,0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/11_curious_traveller?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,300,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,300,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,60000,"[""['hello',"", ""'turn',"", ""'tripadvisor',"", ""'community',"", ""'excruciate',"", ""'experience',"", ""'try',"", ""'clarify',"", ""'ba',"", ""'heathrow',"", ""'hand',"", ""'insights',"", ""'main',"", ""'question',"", ""'whether',"", ""'feasible',"", ""'fly',"", ""'red',"", ""'country',"", ""'brussels',"", ""'transit',"", ""'via',"", ""'lhr',"", ""'two',"", ""'separate',"", ""'book',"", ""'relevant',"", ""'detail',"", ""'write',"", ""'wife',"", ""'fly',"", ""'mexico',"", ""'city',"", ""'red',"", ""'brussels',"", ""'via',"", ""'lhr',"", ""'flight',"", ""'ba',"", ""'two',"", ""'separate',"", ""'ticket',"", ""'due',"", ""'fact',"", ""'outbound',"", ""'flight',"", ""'lhr',"", ""'eg',"", ""'lhr',"", ""'mexico',"", ""'city',"", ""'trip',"", ""'one',"", ""'ticket',"", ""'lhr',"", ""'brussels',"", ""'separate',"", ""'add',"", ""'ticket',"", ""'flight',"", ""'brussels',"", ""'4hrs',"", ""'schedule',"", ""'arrival',"", ""'lhr',"", ""'ie',"", ""'day',"", ""'transit',"", ""'uk',"", ""'resident',"", ""'wife',"", ""'belgian',"", ""'resident',"", ""'allow',"", ""'lhrs',"", ""'immigration',"", ""'control',"", ""'per',"", ""'current',"", ""'regulation',"", ""'therefore',"", ""'transit',"", ""'airside',"", ""'immigration',"", ""'viable',"", ""'carry',"", ""'hand',"", ""'luggage',"", ""'brussels',"", ""'flight',"", ""'online',"", ""'beforehand',"", ""'principle',"", ""'proceed',"", ""'directly',"", ""'connect',"", ""'flight',"", ""'immigration',"", ""'worry',"", ""'1',"", ""'mexico',"", ""'city',"", ""'lhr',"", ""'brussels',"", ""'trip',"", ""'two',"", ""'separate',"", ""'ticket',"", ""'worry',"", ""'staff',"", ""'mexico',"", ""'city',"", ""'airport',"", ""'consideration',"", ""'mexico',"", ""'city',"", ""'lhr',"", ""'flight',"", ""'isolation',"", ""'pre',"", ""'book',"", ""'quarantine',"", ""'hotel',"", ""'deny',"", ""'board',"", ""'wife',"", ""'non',"", ""'resident',"", ""'absurd',"", ""'flight',"", ""'ba',"", ""'simply',"", ""'able',"", ""'confirm',"", ""'2',"", ""'able',"", ""'online',"", ""'lhr',"", ""'brussels',"", ""'flight',"", ""'beforehand',"", ""'proper',"", ""'transit',"", ""'proof',"", ""'show',"", ""'board',"", ""'mexico',"", ""'city',"", ""'lhr',"", ""'flight',"", ""'somehow',"", ""'able',"", ""'board',"", ""'flight',"", ""'immigration',"", ""'lhr',"", ""'lhr',"", ""'brussels',"", ""'flight',"", ""'see',"", ""'become',"", ""'lengthy',"", ""'post',"", ""'desperate',"", ""'advice',"", ""'much']""]",False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

so here’s question: possible stay hotel near airport given current restrictions, doomed trying comfy ion seat terminal night? amber list quarantine, day test, etc., appreciate enlightenment type situation transiting overnight stay.
thank advance help!","i can’t seem to find a clear answer for this, or anything related to it due to a search.
we will be returning to canada sept 16. flying from krakow (krakow to glasgow to gatwick) on sept 15, and had planned on spending the night in the airport before flying home the next morning. we are both canadian citizens, fully vaccinated, and will be completing a pcr test before leaving krakow. i am aware that canada is currently on the amber list.
i made a booking in june to stay at the bloc gatwick, thinking that since it’s in the terminal we would not be considered as leaving the airport and ok for covid restrictions. this morning i received an email from bloc offering a discount for their “reopening” sept 22. it appears that even though they are closed, they took the reservation and accepted my payment, but that sort of thing has been par for the course with this trip!
so here’s my question: is it possible to stay in a hotel near the airport given current restrictions, or are we doomed to trying to get comfy ion a seat in the terminal for the night? i know being on the amber list we have to quarantine, take day 2 test, etc., but would appreciate any enlightenment for this type of situation where you are transiting with an overnight stay.

if you leave early enough then although you’ve got to drive south to dover, the rest is just an easy but relentlessly dull long drive. leaving after 6am and train is the obvious solution.
i’ve tried flying, the major airports (lgw and stn) work out slower when you take into account the check in / security times as well as the access to and from the airports. lcy is much better but services may not suit you and it’s hardly the easiest place to get to from north east kent.
clearly the train has most potential, but you’ve got to get to the station and when you arrive in edinburgh you’ve got an onward journey. you are probably looking at saving 90 minutes actual travelling time going by train, which will be eroded by changes and onward connections. my experience leaving early was that i could drive, stop three times and get to edinburgh waverley and park in time to pick up a friend who had used public transport and set off later. and he had the added grief of lugging his luggage about too - mind you he was working on the train.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g503916-i18569-k13470955-Sandwich_to_Edinburgh-Sandwich_Kent_England.html,Sandwich to Edinburgh,Mark E,US,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mark_Elliott?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,100,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,100,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,100,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,30000,"[""['i’ll',"", ""'upset',"", ""'reckon',"", ""'drive',"", ""'door',"", ""'door',"", ""'edinburgh',"", ""'door',"", ""'fastest',"", ""'early',"", ""'you’ve',"", ""'drive',"", ""'south',"", ""'dover',"", ""'rest',"", ""'easy',"", ""'relentlessly',"", ""'dull',"", ""'long',"", ""'drive',"", ""'6am',"", ""'train',"", ""'obvious',"", ""'solution',"", ""'i’ve',"", ""'try',"", ""'fly',"", ""'major',"", ""'airports',"", ""'lgw',"", ""'stn',"", ""'work',"", ""'slower',"", ""'account',"", ""'security',"", ""'time',"", ""'access',"", ""'airports',"", ""'lcy',"", ""'much',"", ""'service',"", ""'may',"", ""'suit',"", ""'it’s',"", ""'hardly',"", ""'easiest',"", ""'place',"", ""'north',"", ""'east',"", ""'kent',"", ""'clearly',"", ""'train',"", ""'potential',"", ""'you’ve',"", ""'station',"", ""'arrive',"", ""'edinburgh',"", ""'you’ve',"", ""'onward',"", ""'journey',"", ""'save',"", ""'90',"", ""'minutes',"", ""'actual',"", ""'travel',"", ""'time',"", ""'train',"", ""'erode',"", ""'onward',"", ""'connections',"", ""'experience',"", ""'early',"", ""'drive',"", ""'stop',"", ""'three',"", ""'time',"", ""'edinburgh',"", ""'waverley',"", ""'park',"", ""'time',"", ""'pick',"", ""'friend',"", ""'public',"", ""'transport',"", ""'set',"", ""'add',"", ""'grief',"", ""'lug',"", ""'luggage',"", ""'mind',"", ""'work',"", ""'train']""]",False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

edited: 5:11 pm, april 23,","hello,
i got the flight deal for $225 to hnd from dallas, arriving early morning on monday 11/22 and departing mid-morning on wednesday 12/1.
i’d never really seriously considered a trip to japan before because the combo of the expensive flights + reputation as an expensive destination deterred me, but the price was too good to turn down.
there is (hopefully) going to be a sumo tournament in fukuoka while i’m there, so my initial thought was to fly to fukuoka to start and then work my way back north by train/bus.
what should i do? i’m into history and culture, natural beauty, but open to pretty much anything. would like to do a day at universal studios for nintendo+potter world. so that + the sumo are 2 days, and i basically have 7-8 more days to fill. what do i do?
i am a budget traveler so would love hostel or japanese-style guesthouse recs and cheap delicious eats suggestions. i could probably splurge on a nice dinner or two ($50-$100 per person range). i tend to save my money to spend on experiences so any tour suggestions or cool places i would love to hear.
the flights are flexible, and let’s assume that vaccinated travelers are allowed into japan without quarantine (i know that may end up not being the case), and that japan is in the new normal before the most recent lockdown coming up.
would love any itinerary suggestions!

what to do in japan of course depends on your tastes and how long you are there. make sure all of your hotels have no penalty for cancellation. if you want to get out of tokyo and are planning on making extensive use of the transportation system, a japan rail pass might be worth looking in to. just be sure not to purchase it until very close to the date of travel if things look like they will go your way.

==> let's say you stay the nights of ap 2-3 in huế; then on the very early morning of apr 4, take the se8 train to ninh bình.
at the moment, the only train showing is the se8; i don't know if they will resume any of the other trains by then. the departure of the se 8 is at 3h12 (in the wee hours of the morning), arriving at 16h07.
can you deal with that?
otherwise, consider paying for a longer train trip (đà nẵng - hà nội):
- the se 6 schedule: 10h35 (đn) - 4h35 (hn) the next day.
but you will get on in huế at about 13h37 in the early afternoon and jump off at ninh bình around 3h (in the wee hours of the morning the next day).
- the se 4 schedule: 12h56 (dn) - 5:50 (hn) the next day
but you will get on in huế at about 16h in the afternoon and jump off at ninh bình around 4h20 (next day morning, which apr 5.
the train schedule may very well change in the future as i think i already saw some discrepancy between the info on the official website (dsvn.vn) and those of the resellers or information providers (like the man in seat 61)
in another word, you need to consider the downtime on a long stretch and give yourself enough time.
otherwise, you may have to fly into hanoi and start the northern portion of the trip there.

cheaper are probably budget airlines, but to do this you will have to go to saigon > bangkok > phuket.
airasia via kl is probably nearly as easy, but may be more expensive because you do 2 'international' flights (internals are normally cheaper).

as for flying to and getting around the region, it can be a fruitless exercise trying to source airfare and determine routes in the current climate. anything booked anytime soon is likely to be subject to change or cancellation. the cheapest way is likely to be to fly into bkk and then find regional flights with budget carriers. for a variety of reasons my preferred option is air asia but there are many other carriers in sea. flexibilty , may not be an issue for you, if so, booking way in advance can yield really cheap fares, though if needed you can pay for additional flexibility.
the most time effective method, as suggested above, is to go for an open jaw ticket, say into bkk and our from sgn .
the only time i have found booking all the fare together on the same ticket is where there are special sales on or where flying from u.k. to australia stopping over in sea for a while along the way.
we have stayed all over saigon over the years, from five star places to small budget places. six or seven years ago we found ms yangs homestay in district 3 and wouldn’t stay anywhere else. though in d3 it is walking distance to the war remnants museum and the reunification palace and is in a non touristy neighbourhood with some really great places to eat.
given your sated interest in the war, i would seriously consider a few days in saigon before travelling through the mekong delta and getting a boat to phnom penh, another wonderful city. aging , as suggested above, maybe hit angkor from there or head off to bangkok.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g293921-i8432-k13574687-Ho_Chi_Minh_Bangkok_Pattaya_from_New_York_City-Vietnam.html,Ho Chi Minh - Bangkok - Pattaya from New York City,crellston,UK,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/crellston?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,500,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,320,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,80,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,78800,"[""['saigon',"", ""'spend',"", ""'couple',"", ""'weeks',"", ""'context',"", ""'4',"", ""'6',"", ""'months',"", ""'travel',"", ""'asia',"", ""'month',"", ""'play',"", ""'3',"", ""'days',"", ""'right',"", ""'little',"", ""'bangkok',"", ""'easy',"", ""'spread',"", ""'time',"", ""'thinly',"", ""'asia',"", ""'imo',"", ""'far',"", ""'way',"", ""'live',"", ""'cities',"", ""'fair',"", ""'couldn’t',"", ""'pay',"", ""'spend',"", ""'amount',"", ""'time',"", ""'pattaya',"", ""'fly',"", ""'region',"", ""'fruitless',"", ""'exercise',"", ""'try',"", ""'source',"", ""'airfare',"", ""'determine',"", ""'rout',"", ""'current',"", ""'climate',"", ""'book',"", ""'anytime',"", ""'soon',"", ""'subject',"", ""'cancellation',"", ""'cheapest',"", ""'way',"", ""'fly',"", ""'bkk',"", ""'regional',"", ""'flight',"", ""'budget',"", ""'carriers',"", ""'variety',"", ""'reason',"", ""'prefer',"", ""'air',"", ""'asia',"", ""'many',"", ""'carriers',"", ""'sea',"", ""'flexibilty',"", ""'may',"", ""'book',"", ""'way',"", ""'advance',"", ""'yield',"", ""'cheap',"", ""'fare',"", ""'pay',"", ""'additional',"", ""'flexibility',"", ""'time',"", ""'effective',"", ""'method',"", ""'open',"", ""'jaw',"", ""'ticket',"", ""'bkk',"", ""'sgn',"", ""'time',"", ""'book',"", ""'fare',"", ""'together',"", ""'ticket',"", ""'special',"", ""'sales',"", ""'fly',"", ""'uk',"", ""'australia',"", ""'stop',"", ""'sea',"", ""'way',"", ""'stay',"", ""'saigon',"", ""'five',"", ""'star',"", ""'place',"", ""'small',"", ""'budget',"", ""'place',"", ""'six',"", ""'seven',"", ""'ms',"", ""'yangs',"", ""'homestay',"", ""'district',"", ""'3',"", ""'wouldn’t',"", ""'stay',"", ""'d3',"", ""'walk',"", ""'distance',"", ""'war',"", ""'remnants',"", ""'museum',"", ""'reunification',"", ""'palace',"", ""'non',"", ""'touristy',"", ""'neighbourhood',"", ""'place',"", ""'eat',"", ""'sate',"", ""'interest',"", ""'war',"", ""'seriously',"", ""'days',"", ""'saigon',"", ""'travel',"", ""'mekong',"", ""'delta',"", ""'boat',"", ""'phnom',"", ""'penh',"", ""'wonderful',"", ""'city',"", ""'age',"", ""'hit',"", ""'angkor',"", ""'head',"", ""'bangkok']""]",False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

vân đồn is an international airport, but the number of routes is very limited as most of them are served by chartered flights; last i saw of a regular flight is to shenzhen, china.
from đà nẵng, you either fly into hanoi (nội bài airport - han) or hải phòng (cát bi airport - hph).
hải phòng is also an international airport, if you can connect in shenzen, kunming (china) or seoul-incheon (s. korea); again, the number of flights is rather limited.
as regard to đà nẵng, i'm different from most on this forum; i prefer to base out of đà nẵng with 2-3 weeks (rather than hội an) - partially because i can ride a motorbike. it's centrally located such that i can do a day trip to many interesting (and off the beaten path) places.

(these are just a few examples; you would need a month or two to cover just the highlights of đà nẵng, thừa thiên - huế, quảng nam, and northern quảng ngãi).

edited: 12:28 pm, march 22,","@john p- my reasoning for the nicer hotel on the way in is my kid's never taken that long of a flight before, and i barely remember my other visit to se asia (back ij 2012, when i did 4 countries in 5 weeks), so i figured it would be easier to settle in staying at the myst than at nguyen shack.
having reviewed the extremely helpful advice i've received, here's where i'm netting out so far:

a few random questions:
does it make more sense to get my cambodian visa in ny or should i get it at the border when i'm taking the mekong eyes boat?
i've read through everyone's replies- seems like a lot of people prefer to spend their time exploring the mekong delta, as opposed to heading to an island. considering that i'm traveling with a teenager and that i ultimately need to wind up in can tho, is there a better way we could spend the 5 days that i currently have allotted to rach gia> hon son> rach gia> can tho?
is there anything i should be considering while traveling around new years (12/31- 1/1)? my current itinerary has us flying in to siem reap on 12/30, so we'll be settled and spending new years in sr. i don't like to travel on 12/31 if i can avoid it, so this seemed to be a decent plan.

if the open jaw ticket home>hiroshima, tokyo>home is prohibitively expensive, i would look at an open jaw ticket from home>osaka, tokyo>home and see what the prices look like. after flying into osaka, you could just take a shinkansen to hiroshima and not have to worry about missing or waiting around for a connecting flight.

2. if you can't get the hiroshima connection using the same ticket, then start your trip at tokyo. from tokyo, take the train to kyoto/osaka (2.5 hours). from kyoto/osaka, take the train to hiroshima (100 minutes). leaving hiroshima, see if you can fly out there with a same ticket connection. if not, just take the train back to tokyo. to make your trip less rushed, stay a couple of days at tokyo at the end of your trip before departure;
3. flying into/out of osaka is a viable option but the current flight schedule is much reduced so it might not work out. if things get back to normal, it's worth checking out.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g294232-i525-k13588256-Advice_on_air_travel_itinerary-Japan.html,Advice on air travel itinerary,SammyFD,HK,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SammyFD?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,700,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,700,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,140000,"[""['airlines',"", ""'various',"", ""'options',"", ""'fly',"", ""'different',"", ""'port',"", ""'days',"", ""'via',"", ""'connection',"", ""'necessary',"", ""'book',"", ""'ticket',"", ""'buy',"", ""'two',"", ""'separate',"", ""'one',"", ""'way',"", ""'ticket',"", ""'worry',"", ""'unprotected',"", ""'connection',"", ""'specify',"", ""'fly',"", ""'normally',"", ""'international',"", ""'flight',"", ""'land',"", ""'tokyo',"", ""'narita',"", ""'nrt',"", ""'airport',"", ""'nrt',"", ""'fewer',"", ""'domestic',"", ""'flight',"", ""'lack',"", ""'flight',"", ""'hiroshima',"", ""'airport',"", ""'current',"", ""'schedule',"", ""'show',"", ""'operator',"", ""'low',"", ""'cost',"", ""'carrier',"", ""'combine',"", ""'leg',"", ""'international',"", ""'flight',"", ""'fly',"", ""'tokyo',"", ""'ticket',"", ""'risk',"", ""'separate',"", ""'ticket',"", ""'connection',"", ""'unprotected',"", ""'delay',"", ""'cause',"", ""'miss',"", ""'connection',"", ""'work',"", ""'airline',"", ""'hiroshima',"", ""'new',"", ""'flight',"", ""'possibly',"", ""'cost',"", ""'fly',"", ""'tokyo',"", ""'haneda',"", ""'hnd',"", ""'flight',"", ""'daily',"", ""'hiroshima',"", ""'able',"", ""'immediate',"", ""'connection',"", ""'flight',"", ""'onto',"", ""'ticket',"", ""'ideal',"", ""'situation',"", ""'therefore',"", ""'flight',"", ""'onto',"", ""'ticket',"", ""'itinerary',"", ""'start',"", ""'trip',"", ""'visit',"", ""'tokyo',"", ""'work',"", ""'way',"", ""'hiroshima',"", ""'train',"", ""'sum',"", ""'1',"", ""'buy',"", ""'two',"", ""'one',"", ""'way',"", ""'ticket',"", ""'2',"", ""'hiroshima',"", ""'connection',"", ""'ticket',"", ""'start',"", ""'trip',"", ""'tokyo',"", ""'tokyo',"", ""'train',"", ""'kyoto',"", ""'osaka',"", ""'25',"", ""'hours',"", ""'kyoto',"", ""'osaka',"", ""'train',"", ""'hiroshima',"", ""'100',"", ""'minutes',"", ""'hiroshima',"", ""'see',"", ""'fly',"", ""'ticket',"", ""'connection',"", ""'train',"", ""'tokyo',"", ""'trip',"", ""'less',"", ""'rush',"", ""'stay',"", ""'couple',"", ""'days',"", ""'tokyo',"", ""'end',"", ""'trip',"", ""'departure',"", ""'3',"", ""'fly',"", ""'osaka',"", ""'viable',"", ""'current',"", ""'flight',"", ""'schedule',"", ""'much',"", ""'reduce',"", ""'work',"", ""'normal',"", ""'worth']""]",False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

skipping legs cause cancellation remaining sectors. that.",">>there are no direct flights from my country to hiroshima. there are only connect flights through tokyo.
instead of the domestic flight, most of the people overlook the option of transiting via other east asian hubs such as seoul and taipei, which do offer routes to some smaller airports in japan. it is way better than transiting via tokyo as you do not need to worry baggage claim at transit point (as check through) and no immigration is needed for international-international transit. most important, you have very very low chance to have inter-airport transit which can be a nightmare (quite often when booking flights with nrt/hnd transit flights)
>>but then i realised, i would need a one-way ticket from my home country to hiroshima and then another one-way ticket from tokyo back home. what i didn't knew before that was, that a one-way ticket is way more expensive than a round trip ticket.
what you should look for is the ""multi-city / multi-stop"" option when booking the tickets on the airline official site. that allows you having the different arrival and departure cities within the same ticket (in a more professional term, open jaw ticket). mostly the ticket costs you more or less the same as a round trip.
>>first of all i thought about getting a round trip ticket from my home country to tokyo and book a separate ticket from tokyo to hiroshima. that's quite risky. if the tokyo flight is delayed the hiroshima one would not be refunded and i'd be stranded in tokyo with nothing booked and nothing prepared.
therefore we do always suggest people to have all flights booked into the same ticket so that you are protected if flight is delayed.
>>my second thought was booking a round way ticket from my home country to hiroshima, and because it connects in tokyo, on my way back i could just not bord the flight in hiroshima fland get on in tokyo. but i don't even know if that's possible/ allowed.
skipping legs will cause the cancellation of the remaining sectors. don't do that.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g294232-i525-k13588256-Advice_on_air_travel_itinerary-Japan.html,Advice on air travel itinerary,HiroSKMT,CN,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HiroSKMT?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,600,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,600,0,0,415,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,154445,"[""['direct',"", ""'flight',"", ""'country',"", ""'hiroshima',"", ""'connect',"", ""'flight',"", ""'tokyo',"", ""'instead',"", ""'domestic',"", ""'flight',"", ""'people',"", ""'overlook',"", ""'transit',"", ""'via',"", ""'east',"", ""'asian',"", ""'hubs',"", ""'seoul',"", ""'taipei',"", ""'rout',"", ""'smaller',"", ""'airports',"", ""'japan',"", ""'way',"", ""'transit',"", ""'via',"", ""'tokyo',"", ""'worry',"", ""'baggage',"", ""'claim',"", ""'transit',"", ""'point',"", ""'immigration',"", ""'international',"", ""'international',"", ""'transit',"", ""'important',"", ""'low',"", ""'inter',"", ""'airport',"", ""'transit',"", ""'nightmare',"", ""'quite',"", ""'book',"", ""'flight',"", ""'nrt',"", ""'hnd',"", ""'transit',"", ""'flight',"", ""'realise',"", ""'one',"", ""'way',"", ""'ticket',"", ""'home',"", ""'country',"", ""'hiroshima',"", ""'one',"", ""'way',"", ""'ticket',"", ""'tokyo',"", ""'home',"", ""'one',"", ""'way',"", ""'ticket',"", ""'way',"", ""'expensive',"", ""'round',"", ""'trip',"", ""'ticket',"", ""'multi',"", ""'city',"", ""'multi',"", ""'stop',"", ""'book',"", ""'ticket',"", ""'airline',"", ""'official',"", ""'site',"", ""'allow',"", ""'different',"", ""'arrival',"", ""'departure',"", ""'cities',"", ""'ticket',"", ""'professional',"", ""'term',"", ""'open',"", ""'jaw',"", ""'ticket',"", ""'mostly',"", ""'ticket',"", ""'cost',"", ""'less',"", ""'round',"", ""'trip',"", ""'round',"", ""'trip',"", ""'ticket',"", ""'home',"", ""'country',"", ""'tokyo',"", ""'book',"", ""'separate',"", ""'ticket',"", ""'tokyo',"", ""'hiroshima',"", ""'quite',"", ""'risky',"", ""'tokyo',"", ""'flight',"", ""'delay',"", ""'hiroshima',"", ""'one',"", ""'refund',"", ""'strand',"", ""'tokyo',"", ""'book',"", ""'prepare',"", ""'therefore',"", ""'people',"", ""'flight',"", ""'book',"", ""'ticket',"", ""'protect',"", ""'flight',"", ""'delay',"", ""'second',"", ""'book',"", ""'round',"", ""'way',"", ""'ticket',"", ""'home',"", ""'country',"", ""'hiroshima',"", ""'connect',"", ""'tokyo',"", ""'way',"", ""'bord',"", ""'flight',"", ""'hiroshima',"", ""'fland',"", ""'tokyo',"", ""'allow',"", ""'skip',"", ""'legs',"", ""'cause',"", ""'cancellation',"", ""'remain',"", ""'sectors']""]",False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

my boyfriend and i both have terrible backs, and sitting in a seat for the long simply is not an option for either of us. the only way for us to do this trip is to fly business class / have the option to lay flat. i have chase sapphire preferred, and have been collecting my points, but at this rate, i will only have enough points to cover maybe half of one of our flights.
i see a lot of people suggesting buying economy tickets and going for an upgrade, but i really can't take the chance of not getting that upgrade, and then having to sit in the seats. i hope this does not come across as bratty, it is really just a physical limitation that we both have.
we are willing to fly out of any airport in the us (though we are based out of nyc). what is the cheapest way to do this?",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g294232-i525-k13490756-Best_way_to_fly_business_class_from_USA_to_Tokyo-Japan.html,best way to fly business class from USA to Tokyo???,taylor,"Jersey City, New...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/taylorpG3292WS?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,100,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,100,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,100,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,100,0,0.0,0.0,100,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,50000,"[""['loosely',"", ""'plan',"", ""'trip',"", ""'tokyo',"", ""'travel',"", ""'spring',"", ""'2022',"", ""'long',"", ""'covid19',"", ""'world',"", ""'allow',"", ""'boyfriend',"", ""'terrible',"", ""'sit',"", ""'seat',"", ""'long',"", ""'simply',"", ""'way',"", ""'trip',"", ""'fly',"", ""'business',"", ""'class',"", ""'lay',"", ""'flat',"", ""'chase',"", ""'sapphire',"", ""'prefer',"", ""'collect',"", ""'point',"", ""'rate',"", ""'point',"", ""'cover',"", ""'half',"", ""'one',"", ""'flight',"", ""'see',"", ""'lot',"", ""'people',"", ""'buy',"", ""'economy',"", ""'ticket',"", ""'upgrade',"", ""'upgrade',"", ""'sit',"", ""'seat',"", ""'bratty',"", ""'physical',"", ""'limitation',"", ""'fly',"", ""'airport',"", ""'base',"", ""'nyc',"", ""'cheapest',"", ""'way']""]",False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

one follow up question - we have 8 nights and most of a 9th day in japan, flying into and out of haneda airport. i was thinking we would spend the first 4 nights in tokyo, the next 4 nights in kyoto, and since we do not depart from haneda until 18:40 on day 9, we would take a bullet train directly from kyoto to haneda. does that sound ok, or should we instead do 3 nights tokyo, 4 nights kyoto, and 1 night near haneda? we are traveling with an 8 year old and would prefer to not switch hotels too often. please let me know what you think. thank you so much!",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g294232-i525-k13538118-Visit_Japan_December_2020_or_February_2021-Japan.html,Visit Japan December 2020 or February 2021 ?,NYTravelerBD,"Larchmont, New York",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NYTravelerBD?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,50,0,0,50,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,200,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,25000,"[""['much',"", ""'global',"", ""'airfare',"", ""'ticket',"", ""'good',"", ""'flexibility',"", ""'book',"", ""'wholly',"", ""'refundable',"", ""'hotels',"", ""'one',"", ""'question',"", ""'8',"", ""'nights',"", ""'9th',"", ""'day',"", ""'japan',"", ""'fly',"", ""'haneda',"", ""'airport',"", ""'spend',"", ""'4',"", ""'nights',"", ""'tokyo',"", ""'4',"", ""'nights',"", ""'kyoto',"", ""'depart',"", ""'haneda',"", ""'1840',"", ""'day',"", ""'9',"", ""'bullet',"", ""'train',"", ""'directly',"", ""'kyoto',"", ""'haneda',"", ""'sound',"", ""'instead',"", ""'3',"", ""'nights',"", ""'tokyo',"", ""'4',"", ""'nights',"", ""'kyoto',"", ""'1',"", ""'night',"", ""'near',"", ""'haneda',"", ""'travel',"", ""'8',"", ""'old',"", ""'prefer',"", ""'switch',"", ""'hotels',"", ""'much']""]",False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

all international flights land t3 - previously international terminal haneda (hnd). entering public area arrival floor, large bus ticket sales counter less 20m away buy limo bus tickets directly. bus stops level (ground floor) accessible large lifts. ticket staffs bus stop # direction unsure.
it's good idea buy limo bus tickets advance overseas. cannot catch bus - due flight delays etc., bus tickets void buy next bus.

all international flights land at t3 - previously the international terminal in haneda (hnd). after entering into the public area on the arrival floor, there is a large bus ticket sales counter in less than 20m away where you can buy limo bus tickets directly. the bus stops are on level 1 (ground floor) accessible by large lifts. ask the ticket staffs for the bus stop # and direction if unsure.
it's not a good idea to buy limo bus tickets in advance while overseas. should you cannot catch that bus - due to flight delays etc., the bus tickets would be void and you'd have to buy another one for the next bus.

i am from europe and on my last trip to japan, i chose to land in tokyo and depart from osaka kansai airport (easily accessible from both osaka and kyoto). it saved on taking the bullet train back to tokyo just to catch a plane home.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g294232-i525-k13507953-Transfer_from_Haneda_Airport_to_Hotel_nr_Tokyo_Station-Japan.html,Transfer from Haneda Airport to Hotel nr Tokyo Station,Beatrice,US,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Beatrice2JP?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,100,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,100,0,0,100,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,30000,"[""['late',"", ""'slightly',"", ""'topic',"", ""'tokyo',"", ""'kyoto',"", ""'departure',"", ""'country',"", ""'book',"", ""'open',"", ""'jaw',"", ""'flight',"", ""'call',"", ""'multi',"", ""'destination',"", ""'ticket',"", ""'europe',"", ""'trip',"", ""'japan',"", ""'land',"", ""'tokyo',"", ""'depart',"", ""'osaka',"", ""'kansai',"", ""'airport',"", ""'easily',"", ""'accessible',"", ""'osaka',"", ""'kyoto',"", ""'save',"", ""'bullet',"", ""'train',"", ""'tokyo',"", ""'catch',"", ""'plane',"", ""'home']""]",False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

‘same ticket’ means all your flights are booked under one pnr number.

if both flights are under one pnr, then you are good to go and no need to exit the airport through immigration in japan.
if you are using a travel agency, they often, but not always string together a few flights (which are cheapest) under separate pnr numbers. if that is the case, japan will not let you board during covid pandemic without a long term visa.

as to your itinerary, for your reference, i am a relatively fast paced traveler with many european driving trips experience. however, i cannot possibly go at your speed which involves going to one destination daily and then spending multiple hours on the road. i am not saying this to be unhelpful, but at your pace, none of us can give you any useful comments other than telling you to slow down. if you must go at this incredible pace, it's unlikely any of us has such experience to offer you guidance.
with 3 weeks in japan, i would skip okinawa, then drop either fukuoka or hokkaido. to see fukuoka or hokkaido properly, you need a minimum of 5-7 days *each*. also, understand that places like sapporo and hakodate aren't really what hokkaido is about. visitors are attracted by the natural scenery of the island. during the first half of october, the focus should be on the country side to see foliage, not more cities. you hardly have enough time to see the various sides of tokyo or osaka.
bottomline: less (transport time) is more (sightseeing time, real experience) for most of us.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g294232-i525-k13517957-3_Week_Packed_Japan_Trip_Oct_2021_Draft_Itinerary-Japan.html,3-Week (Packed) Japan Trip Oct 2021 - Draft Itinerary,SammyFD,HK,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SammyFD?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,50,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,50,0,0,200,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,50,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,27500,"[""['commit',"", ""'plane',"", ""'ticket',"", ""'point',"", ""'good',"", ""'sit',"", ""'vouchers',"", ""'credit',"", ""'changeable',"", ""'flight',"", ""'ticket',"", ""'options',"", ""'frustration',"", ""'keep',"", ""'money',"", ""'possibly',"", ""'months',"", ""'book',"", ""'hotels',"", ""'require',"", ""'prepayment',"", ""'itinerary',"", ""'reference',"", ""'relatively',"", ""'fast',"", ""'pace',"", ""'traveler',"", ""'many',"", ""'european',"", ""'drive',"", ""'trip',"", ""'experience',"", ""'cannot',"", ""'possibly',"", ""'speed',"", ""'involve',"", ""'one',"", ""'destination',"", ""'daily',"", ""'spend',"", ""'multiple',"", ""'hours',"", ""'road',"", ""'unhelpful',"", ""'pace',"", ""'none',"", ""'useful',"", ""'comment',"", ""'tell',"", ""'slow',"", ""'must',"", ""'incredible',"", ""'pace',"", ""'unlikely',"", ""'experience',"", ""'guidance',"", ""'3',"", ""'weeks',"", ""'japan',"", ""'skip',"", ""'okinawa',"", ""'drop',"", ""'fukuoka',"", ""'hokkaido',"", ""'see',"", ""'fukuoka',"", ""'hokkaido',"", ""'properly',"", ""'minimum',"", ""'5',"", ""'7',"", ""'days',"", ""'place',"", ""'sapporo',"", ""'hakodate',"", ""'arent',"", ""'hokkaido',"", ""'visitors',"", ""'attract',"", ""'natural',"", ""'scenery',"", ""'island',"", ""'half',"", ""'october',"", ""'focus',"", ""'country',"", ""'side',"", ""'see',"", ""'foliage',"", ""'cities',"", ""'hardly',"", ""'time',"", ""'see',"", ""'various',"", ""'side',"", ""'tokyo',"", ""'osaka',"", ""'bottomline',"", ""'less',"", ""'transport',"", ""'time',"", ""'sightsee',"", ""'time',"", ""'real',"", ""'experience']""]",False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

does this mean if i'd fly now to get to bali that i would be stuck in jakarta airport? since there are no direct flights at the moment, just wondering... cause i don't mind staying in bali even if there are few tourists, but this makes it look like i can't even get to bali if the borders are completely shut down. please correct me if my thoughts on this is wrong, thank you :)

get b211a business visa high costs guarantuee.
for costs visa (through agent), plus negative pcr-tests (1 departure, upon arrival jakarta, quarantaine), plus quarantaine jakarta must count minimum 850 euro (but 1000 euro’s realistic) top ticket. need test returning france. cheap (mid december 150 euro’s).
the best options ticket qatar emirates, particular qatar never stopped flying to/from jakarta outbreak last year.
but aware: sure everything ok, sure board airplaine, sure pass immigration jakarta.
yes lot succes stories lot disappointments.

like suggested: girlfriend france opinion far realistic way around. it’s cheaper. reason tickets jakarta europe cheaper europe jakarta (which normally way around). difference price 200 euro’s. visa france much cheaper. girlfriend returns indonesia mandatory pcr-tests quarantaine indonesian (i suppose indonesian) free charge her.
so win win situation you. less costs, less hassle.
otherwise wait.","yes indeed let’s stick to the subject and the questions of the topic. whether we like it or not, indonesia is still closed for travelers and what we think how they should act is not relevant.
about the regulations: indonesia is closed for tourists and nobody knows when the country will reopen and what the policy will be.
about the possibility to meet your girlfriend there are two options.
- option 1
get a b211a business visa but at high costs and no guarantuee.
for the costs of the visa (through an agent), plus the 3 negative pcr-tests (1 before departure, 1 upon arrival in jakarta, 1 after the quarantaine), plus quarantaine in jakarta you must count on a minimum of 850 euro (but 1000 euro’s is more realistic) on top of your ticket. and maybe you also need another test when returning to france. also not very cheap (mid december around 150 euro’s).
the best options for a ticket are with qatar or emirates, in particular qatar who never stopped flying to/from jakarta since the outbreak last year.
but be aware: not sure everything will be ok, not sure if you can board the airplaine, not sure if you can pass immigration in jakarta.
yes there are a lot of succes stories but also a lot disappointments.
- option 2
like i suggested: get your girlfriend to france which is to my opinion far more realistic than the other way around. it’s also cheaper. for some reason tickets jakarta to europe are cheaper than europe to jakarta (which is normally the other way around). difference in price up to 200 euro’s. visa for france is also much cheaper. and when you girlfriend returns to indonesia she also is mandatory to do the pcr-tests and quarantaine but as an indonesian (i suppose she is indonesian) this is free of charge for her.
so this is a win win situation for you. less costs, less hassle.
otherwise just wait.",0,0,0,0,ID,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,50,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,200,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,200,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,42500,"[""['indeed',"", ""'let’s',"", ""'stick',"", ""'subject',"", ""'question',"", ""'topic',"", ""'whether',"", ""'indonesia',"", ""'close',"", ""'travelers',"", ""'act',"", ""'relevant',"", ""'regulations',"", ""'indonesia',"", ""'close',"", ""'tourists',"", ""'nobody',"", ""'country',"", ""'reopen',"", ""'policy',"", ""'possibility',"", ""'meet',"", ""'girlfriend',"", ""'two',"", ""'options',"", ""'1',"", ""'b211a',"", ""'business',"", ""'visa',"", ""'high',"", ""'cost',"", ""'guarantuee',"", ""'cost',"", ""'visa',"", ""'agent',"", ""'plus',"", ""'3',"", ""'negative',"", ""'pcr',"", ""'test',"", ""'1',"", ""'departure',"", ""'1',"", ""'upon',"", ""'arrival',"", ""'jakarta',"", ""'1',"", ""'quarantaine',"", ""'plus',"", ""'quarantaine',"", ""'jakarta',"", ""'must',"", ""'count',"", ""'minimum',"", ""'850',"", ""'euro',"", ""'1000',"", ""'euro’s',"", ""'realistic',"", ""'top',"", ""'ticket',"", ""'test',"", ""'france',"", ""'cheap',"", ""'mid',"", ""'december',"", ""'150',"", ""'euro’s',"", ""'options',"", ""'ticket',"", ""'qatar',"", ""'emirates',"", ""'particular',"", ""'qatar',"", ""'stop',"", ""'fly',"", ""'jakarta',"", ""'outbreak',"", ""'aware',"", ""'board',"", ""'airplaine',"", ""'pass',"", ""'immigration',"", ""'jakarta',"", ""'lot',"", ""'succes',"", ""'stories',"", ""'lot',"", ""'disappointments',"", ""'2',"", ""'girlfriend',"", ""'france',"", ""'opinion',"", ""'far',"", ""'realistic',"", ""'way',"", ""'it’s',"", ""'cheaper',"", ""'reason',"", ""'ticket',"", ""'jakarta',"", ""'europe',"", ""'cheaper',"", ""'europe',"", ""'jakarta',"", ""'normally',"", ""'way',"", ""'difference',"", ""'price',"", ""'200',"", ""'euro’s',"", ""'visa',"", ""'france',"", ""'much',"", ""'cheaper',"", ""'girlfriend',"", ""'indonesia',"", ""'mandatory',"", ""'pcr',"", ""'test',"", ""'quarantaine',"", ""'indonesian',"", ""'suppose',"", ""'indonesian',"", ""'free',"", ""'charge',"", ""'win',"", ""'win',"", ""'situation',"", ""'less',"", ""'cost',"", ""'less',"", ""'hassle',"", ""'wait']""]",False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

given that domestic tickets are available for sale i would like to understand what difficulties i might run into if trying to travel during this time period.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g294225-i7219-k13522010-Travel_During_Ramadan_2021-Indonesia.html,Travel During Ramadan 2021,aquamarine909,DE,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aquamarine909?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,100,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,100,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,100,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,100,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,40000,"[""['hello',"", ""'wonder',"", ""'explain',"", ""'travel',"", ""'restrictions',"", ""'place',"", ""'ramadan',"", ""'ideally',"", ""'jakarta',"", ""'bali',"", ""'complete',"", ""'5',"", ""'day',"", ""'quarantine',"", ""'may',"", ""'5',"", ""'hear',"", ""'domestic',"", ""'travel',"", ""'disallow',"", ""'ticket',"", ""'sale',"", ""'trouble',"", ""'bali',"", ""'secondly',"", ""'try',"", ""'fly',"", ""'bali',"", ""'jogja',"", ""'ticket',"", ""'jogja',"", ""'kebumen',"", ""'visit',"", ""'family',"", ""'domestic',"", ""'ticket',"", ""'sale',"", ""'difficulties',"", ""'run',"", ""'try',"", ""'travel',"", ""'time',"", ""'period']""]",False,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

ubud area cultural sightseeing scenery.
choose accommodation location wisely particularly ubud. central ubud cultural sites/monkey forest walkable (although i’ve y.o tow). staying check accommodation offers complimentary shuttle service. google maps. accommodation listed ubud miles anywhere.
there metered taxis allowed ubud. need car driver staying shuttle service provided wanting wander ubud centre.
metered taxis available sanur. again, important check hotel location. choose side bypass road.
my personal suggestion stay ubud sanur closer airport departure flight. choose ubud based driver airport transfer driver compatible arrange sightseeing trips transfer sanur.
if wanting accommodation recommendations need state budget.
as mentioned aussies book everything ourselves. personally choose booking.com accommodation. aware airline’s policy refunds. choose “free cancellation” option accommodation. 2020 trip cancelled received full refunds bookings.

have a look at indonesia.tripcanvas.co>bali >family to get an overview of what’s on offer. kemenuh butterfly park is worthwhile. bali bird park and others mentioned above.
ubud is the area for cultural sightseeing and scenery.
choose your accommodation location wisely particularly in ubud. there is central ubud with cultural sites/monkey forest which are walkable (although i’ve not had a 5 y.o in tow). if staying further out check if your accommodation offers a complimentary shuttle service. use google maps. there is accommodation listed as ubud and miles from anywhere.
there are no metered taxis allowed in ubud. you will need a car with driver if staying further out with no shuttle service provided if wanting to wander around ubud centre.
metered taxis are available in sanur. again, important to check hotel location. do not choose over the other side of the bypass road.
my personal suggestion would be to stay in ubud first then sanur which is closer to the airport for your departure flight. choose an ubud based driver for your airport transfer and if the driver is compatible you can arrange your sightseeing trips with him and also your transfer to sanur.
if wanting accommodation recommendations you would need to state your budget.
as mentioned most aussies book everything ourselves. i personally choose booking.com for accommodation. be aware of your airline’s policy on refunds. i always choose the “free cancellation” option for our accommodation. our 2020 trip was cancelled and we received full refunds for all our bookings.
not sure what bali will hold for us when we are able to return. and as for november ...?
happy planning and hope you can travel in november.
cheers.
just saw your post regarding 3 locations. it’s doable if your family doesn’t mind unpacking, packing etc. note check in/check out times for each choice of accommodation. travel time in bali is slow. depending on your flight arrival it may take up to two hours + before arriving in ubud.

edited: 9:34 am, july 04,","hello, am planning to visit indonesia in july/august 2022 for 3 weeks, travel restrictions permitting.
original plan was to fly into dps/bali and:
7 nights in south bali at a beach resort
4 or 5 nights in ubud
4 nights in bandung
5 nights in yogyakarta and then leave via cgk/jakarta
i am probably going to drop bandung and re-allocate the time across the other destinations.
however, i just skim read 'the truth about ubud' thread: 
i didn't read every post on there, i can just imagine what the reality of ubud must be like compared to what i would want it to be like.
therefore, can anyone here help me identify some other location(s) that i can invest somewhere between 4 and 8 nights into (i.e. the time i originally allocated to ubud and bandung).
needs to be somewhere i can reach by a short direct non-stop flight or ferry, and from where i can easily get to cgk or dps for my inbound flight to the uk.
somewhere that is what ubud may have been like a couple of decades ago (less commercialised / touristy) with a lot of outdoor experiences.
as i have some unfinished business in jakarta, i may even consider this:
7 nights south bali (beach resort)
5 nights in xxxx <--- help me here please
5 nights yogyakarta
3 (or 4) nights jakarta
many thanks.

many things are still uncertain.
at the moment tickets are cheap but we dont know what is going to happen in the next 7 to 8 months regarding the frequency of flights. plus we don't know what the policy will be in august/september regarding visa(free). also, will they accept the vaccin or is the pcr test plus quarantaine still obliged? if so you your 3 -week holiday will be reduced to 2 weeks.
booking accomodation a few weeks in advance or on the spot should not be a problem. well, at least this is my experience in more than 33 years.
trains are easy to use on jawa.
from lombok there are flights directly to labuan bajo. (for komodo np).

you might think the usgovt doesn’t have the authority the stop people leaving the country but that doesn’t mean people weren’t/are/will be prevented from leaving the country.
my son has his own company in munich. he has over 20 employees from all over the world. a number from usa, vietnam, brazil, uk as well as some eu citizens. he got a new cto last year. an american whose wife is an eu citizen. although he had all the correct german and us documentation with confirmation that he was starting a new job in munich, already rental contract in place and shipped furniture and his car he and his wife and kids were refused boarding in chicago. this was the airline/airport service (not the govt) interpreting german regulations. my son had to ring the foreign ministry in germany who contacted the airline in chicago to put them right and to allow him and his family to board. this is not the first time it has happened where the airlines self-interpret a countries regulations. another one of my sons employees, a brit, was home visiting his parents in the uk just before xmas. when he tried to fly back before xmas he, along with many others, was refused boarding. simply lufthansa were interpreting the german rules as german passport holders rather than german residents. again my son had to contact the foreign ministry.
so it isn’t just what your own govt says even if they allow travel it is the regulations of the country you are heading to and the airline and airport staffs interpretation of that country’s rules.

recently, there have been many suggestions for open jaw tickets - fly into one japan city and fly out from another. i agree that logistically, it is a great idea as it eliminates back tracking.
however, i have never done it because every time i checked, open jaw tickets carry a big premium. it is at least 50% additional, sometimes higher. i am beginning to wonder whether i am missing something.

so my question to other u.s. travelers is, do you see that same open jaw premium vs roundtrip fare? have you been able to do open jaw trips to japan without paying a premium?",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g294232-i525-k13544848-Open_jaw_fares_from_the_U_S-Japan.html,Open jaw fares from the U.S.,edofva,US,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/edofva?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,100,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,100,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,20000,"[""['question',"", ""'travelers',"", ""'recently',"", ""'many',"", ""'suggestions',"", ""'open',"", ""'jaw',"", ""'ticket',"", ""'fly',"", ""'one',"", ""'japan',"", ""'city',"", ""'fly',"", ""'logistically',"", ""'idea',"", ""'eliminate',"", ""'track',"", ""'time',"", ""'open',"", ""'jaw',"", ""'ticket',"", ""'carry',"", ""'big',"", ""'premium',"", ""'least',"", ""'50',"", ""'additional',"", ""'higher',"", ""'begin',"", ""'wonder',"", ""'whether',"", ""'miss',"", ""'something',"", ""'open',"", ""'jaw',"", ""'point',"", ""'premium',"", ""'cash',"", ""'fare',"", ""'question',"", ""'travelers',"", ""'see',"", ""'open',"", ""'jaw',"", ""'premium',"", ""'vs',"", ""'roundtrip',"", ""'fare',"", ""'able',"", ""'open',"", ""'jaw',"", ""'trip',"", ""'japan',"", ""'pay',"", ""'premium']""]",False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

agree with @bargainhunter above that airports used could influence prices. flying between major hubs *usually* give you cheaper flights. also, when you do the math, you can compare the additional flight cost vs an additional train journey dollar and time cost back to tokyo to fly out. for example, if both cost about the same, i would definitely choose the flight open even if it means a connection via a tokyo airport.

yes, booked directly airlines. segments operated codeshare airlines, sold airlines itinerary. comparison try (1) simple roundtrip u.s. airport japan airport, (2) flying u.s. airport japan airport a, fly japan airport b u.s. airport open jaw airlines (3) simply book two way tickets. u.s. airport japan airport a, japan airport b u.s. airport. comparable, let's travel dates.
so found consistently (1) cheaper (2), (2) cheaper (3). (2) often 50% (1). roundtrip fare $1,300 example, open jaw closer $2,000.
so let's want fly nrt hnd, fly kix. open jaw cost 50% simple roundtrip hnd nrt. instead open jaw, fly kix hnd $120, shinkansen. waste half day that.
what want is, able find open jaw close price simple roundtrip japan. airports mentioned. seen comparable open jaw fly nrt fly japan airport, count.","thanks for all the responses. they made me realize i should have been more clear and provide more information in my questions.
yes, it will be booked directly with the same airlines. some segments may or may not be operated by codeshare airlines, but it will be sold by the same airlines and on one itinerary. the comparison i am try to make is between (1) simple roundtrip from one u.s. airport to one japan airport, (2) flying from one u.s. airport to japan airport a, and fly back from japan airport b to the same u.s. airport as an open jaw with the same airlines and (3) simply book two one way tickets. one from u.s. airport to japan airport a, and one from japan airport b back to the same u.s. airport. to make things comparable, let's use same travel dates.
so what i have found consistently is that (1) is cheaper than (2), and (2) is cheaper than (3). (2) is often 50% more than (1). so if a roundtrip fare is $1,300 as an example, an open jaw would be closer to $2,000.
so let's say i want to fly into either nrt or hnd, but fly back from kix. that open jaw will cost 50% more than a simple roundtrip in and out of hnd or nrt. instead of an open jaw, i can always fly from kix to hnd for around $120, or take the shinkansen. but i will waste half a day doing that.
what i want to know is, has anyone been able to find an open jaw that is close in price to a simple roundtrip between us and japan. it does not have to be between the airports i mentioned. so if anyone have seen a comparable open jaw that fly into nrt but fly out of another japan airport, that would count.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g294232-i525-k13544848-Open_jaw_fares_from_the_U_S-Japan.html,Open jaw fares from the U.S.,edofva,US,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/edofva?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,300,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,134,0,0,300,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,68978,"[""['responses',"", ""'realize',"", ""'clear',"", ""'provide',"", ""'information',"", ""'question',"", ""'book',"", ""'directly',"", ""'airlines',"", ""'segment',"", ""'may',"", ""'may',"", ""'operate',"", ""'codeshare',"", ""'airlines',"", ""'sell',"", ""'airlines',"", ""'one',"", ""'itinerary',"", ""'comparison',"", ""'try',"", ""'1',"", ""'simple',"", ""'roundtrip',"", ""'one',"", ""'airport',"", ""'one',"", ""'japan',"", ""'airport',"", ""'2',"", ""'fly',"", ""'one',"", ""'airport',"", ""'japan',"", ""'airport',"", ""'fly',"", ""'japan',"", ""'airport',"", ""'b',"", ""'airport',"", ""'open',"", ""'jaw',"", ""'airlines',"", ""'3',"", ""'simply',"", ""'book',"", ""'two',"", ""'one',"", ""'way',"", ""'ticket',"", ""'one',"", ""'airport',"", ""'japan',"", ""'airport',"", ""'one',"", ""'japan',"", ""'airport',"", ""'b',"", ""'airport',"", ""'comparable',"", ""'travel',"", ""'date',"", ""'consistently',"", ""'1',"", ""'cheaper',"", ""'2',"", ""'2',"", ""'cheaper',"", ""'3',"", ""'2',"", ""'50',"", ""'1',"", ""'roundtrip',"", ""'fare',"", ""'1300',"", ""'example',"", ""'open',"", ""'jaw',"", ""'closer',"", ""'2000',"", ""'fly',"", ""'nrt',"", ""'hnd',"", ""'fly',"", ""'kix',"", ""'open',"", ""'jaw',"", ""'cost',"", ""'50',"", ""'simple',"", ""'roundtrip',"", ""'hnd',"", ""'nrt',"", ""'instead',"", ""'open',"", ""'jaw',"", ""'fly',"", ""'kix',"", ""'hnd',"", ""'120',"", ""'shinkansen',"", ""'waste',"", ""'half',"", ""'day',"", ""'able',"", ""'open',"", ""'jaw',"", ""'close',"", ""'price',"", ""'simple',"", ""'roundtrip',"", ""'japan',"", ""'airports',"", ""'see',"", ""'comparable',"", ""'open',"", ""'jaw',"", ""'fly',"", ""'nrt',"", ""'fly',"", ""'japan',"", ""'airport',"", ""'count']""]",False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

1. flight kix washington dc iad (i assumed, closest international airport fairfax) full, expensive tickets available. dramatically increase open jaw ticket well, fare open jaw ticket usually calculated average round trip fare iad-tyo-iad iad-kix-iad case
2. promotion available iad tyo, open jaw routing allowed ticket. means original fare iad tyo iad kix round trip usd 1000 normal, airlines offer promotion iad - tyo - iad usd 500 rt, open jaw allowed. look open jaw ticket expensive.
maybe researching route + airlines + date dummy check? easier tell actual reason open jaw ticket expensive.","here are some reason that i can think of
1. the flight from kix to washington dc iad (i assumed, as that is the closest international airport from fairfax) are full, and only expensive tickets are available. that will dramatically increase the open jaw ticket as well, as the fare of open jaw ticket is usually calculated as average of round trip fare of iad-tyo-iad and iad-kix-iad in this case
2. promotion is available for iad to tyo, but open jaw routing is not allowed for such ticket. that means original the fare for iad to tyo or iad to kix round trip would be around usd 1000 in normal, but the airlines offer promotion for iad - tyo - iad of usd 500 rt, with no open jaw allowed. so that it will look like the open jaw ticket expensive.
maybe you can give us your researching route + airlines + date for us to have a dummy check? it will be easier for us to tell you the actual reason why the open jaw ticket is that expensive.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g294232-i525-k13544848-Open_jaw_fares_from_the_U_S-Japan.html,Open jaw fares from the U.S.,HiroSKMT,CN,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HiroSKMT?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,200,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,50,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,50,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,25000,"[""['reason',"", ""'1',"", ""'flight',"", ""'kix',"", ""'washington',"", ""'dc',"", ""'iad',"", ""'assume',"", ""'closest',"", ""'international',"", ""'airport',"", ""'fairfax',"", ""'full',"", ""'expensive',"", ""'ticket',"", ""'dramatically',"", ""'increase',"", ""'open',"", ""'jaw',"", ""'ticket',"", ""'fare',"", ""'open',"", ""'jaw',"", ""'ticket',"", ""'calculate',"", ""'average',"", ""'round',"", ""'trip',"", ""'fare',"", ""'iad',"", ""'tyo',"", ""'iad',"", ""'iad',"", ""'kix',"", ""'iad',"", ""'case',"", ""'2',"", ""'promotion',"", ""'iad',"", ""'tyo',"", ""'open',"", ""'jaw',"", ""'rout',"", ""'allow',"", ""'ticket',"", ""'original',"", ""'fare',"", ""'iad',"", ""'tyo',"", ""'iad',"", ""'kix',"", ""'round',"", ""'trip',"", ""'usd',"", ""'1000',"", ""'normal',"", ""'airlines',"", ""'promotion',"", ""'iad',"", ""'tyo',"", ""'iad',"", ""'usd',"", ""'500',"", ""'rt',"", ""'open',"", ""'jaw',"", ""'allow',"", ""'open',"", ""'jaw',"", ""'ticket',"", ""'expensive',"", ""'research',"", ""'route',"", ""'airlines',"", ""'date',"", ""'dummy',"", ""'easier',"", ""'tell',"", ""'actual',"", ""'reason',"", ""'open',"", ""'jaw',"", ""'ticket',"", ""'expensive']""]",False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

especially when there is lack of flights from kix to the us, i think transiting at 3rd country is the way to go if you want an itinerary with 1 transit stop only.

2. location-wise - right next japan, traveling time seoul tyo kix similar traveling domestic flight japan. long haul legs
3. flights to/from seoul seldom delay
4. icn offers free shower transit pax + various selection food, refresh after/before long haul flight

one of transit ports that can be considered is seoul, and i think you should put it in your consideration as well. apart from the reasons i have mentioned in former posts, here are some great points for transiting at icn
1. lots of flights to tokyo and osaka and the transit time is not that bad.
2. location-wise - it is right next to japan, so traveling time to seoul from tyo or kix is similar as traveling on domestic flight in japan. same for the long haul legs
3. flights to/from seoul seldom delay
4. icn offers free shower for transit pax + various selection of food, and it is a great refresh after/before the long haul flight
5. no visa issue as you don't need any transit visa at seoul, and us passport holders can enter south korea visa-free
>>the shortest distance between u.s. and japan is from our west coast to japan.
i think that should be going via north pole for west-bound flight should be the shortest way, while via west coast for east-bound flight to make use of the westerlies. lol",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g294232-i525-k13544848-Open_jaw_fares_from_the_U_S-Japan.html,Open jaw fares from the U.S.,HiroSKMT,CN,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HiroSKMT?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,300,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,134,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,38978,"[""['transit',"", ""'country',"", ""'outside',"", ""'add',"", ""'time',"", ""'add',"", ""'potential',"", ""'headache',"", ""'flight',"", ""'delay',"", ""'one',"", ""'transit',"", ""'port',"", ""'seoul',"", ""'consideration',"", ""'apart',"", ""'reason',"", ""'former',"", ""'post',"", ""'point',"", ""'transit',"", ""'icn',"", ""'1',"", ""'lot',"", ""'flight',"", ""'tokyo',"", ""'osaka',"", ""'transit',"", ""'time',"", ""'bad',"", ""'2',"", ""'location',"", ""'wise',"", ""'right',"", ""'japan',"", ""'travel',"", ""'time',"", ""'seoul',"", ""'tyo',"", ""'kix',"", ""'similar',"", ""'travel',"", ""'domestic',"", ""'flight',"", ""'japan',"", ""'long',"", ""'haul',"", ""'legs',"", ""'3',"", ""'flight',"", ""'seoul',"", ""'seldom',"", ""'delay',"", ""'4',"", ""'icn',"", ""'free',"", ""'shower',"", ""'transit',"", ""'pax',"", ""'various',"", ""'selection',"", ""'food',"", ""'refresh',"", ""'long',"", ""'haul',"", ""'flight',"", ""'5',"", ""'visa',"", ""'transit',"", ""'visa',"", ""'seoul',"", ""'passport',"", ""'holders',"", ""'enter',"", ""'south',"", ""'korea',"", ""'visa',"", ""'free',"", ""'shortest',"", ""'distance',"", ""'japan',"", ""'west',"", ""'coast',"", ""'japan',"", ""'via',"", ""'north',"", ""'pole',"", ""'west',"", ""'bind',"", ""'flight',"", ""'shortest',"", ""'way',"", ""'via',"", ""'west',"", ""'coast',"", ""'east',"", ""'bind',"", ""'flight',"", ""'westerlies']""]",False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

takayama: try to invest at least 2-3 days in the area. when you add transport time from tokyo to takayama, then takayama to kyoto, it takes almost a whole day. therefore, you want to spend a bit more time to make the transport investment pay off. at a minimum, take a 1/2 day trip to shirakawago. if you can add another day to 1.5 days, head to kyoto via kanazawa.
kyoto/osaka: with a 4/2 night split, you can go either way as to whether it's worth moving around. alternatively, just stay in kyoto for all those nights and then take a day trip to osaka. if you move to osaka, maybe make it a 3 night stay and visit nara from there.
flying out from hiroshima: make sure you check outbound flight availability. during normal times, hiroshima serves a few international destinations to other parts of asia. to go back to the uk, you will need to transit somewhere. you will likely have the most flight choices flying within japan domestically and then connecting at tokyo. note that both tokyo and osaka have two airports. if you intend to make a same day connection, make sure both flights use the same airport. you should also book both flights on the same ticket to protect your connection and guarantee through-checking of bags.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g294232-i525-k13548943-Should_I_get_a_JR_pass_for_this_itinerary-Japan.html,Should I get a JR pass for this itinerary?,Jennifer,0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jenwenchen?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,134,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,300,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,134,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,47956,"[""['tourist',"", ""'worry',"", ""'one',"", ""'strange',"", ""'incident',"", ""'wheen',"", ""'man',"", ""'suit',"", ""'less',"", ""'line',"", ""'behind',"", ""'ticket',"", ""'machine',"", ""'start',"", ""'impatient',"", ""'curse',"", ""'sort',"", ""'name',"", ""'briefly',"", ""'concern',"", ""'countries',"", ""'history',"", ""'difficult',"", ""'takayama',"", ""'try',"", ""'invest',"", ""'least',"", ""'2',"", ""'3',"", ""'days',"", ""'area',"", ""'add',"", ""'transport',"", ""'time',"", ""'tokyo',"", ""'takayama',"", ""'takayama',"", ""'kyoto',"", ""'whole',"", ""'day',"", ""'therefore',"", ""'spend',"", ""'time',"", ""'transport',"", ""'investment',"", ""'pay',"", ""'minimum',"", ""'1',"", ""'2',"", ""'day',"", ""'trip',"", ""'shirakawago',"", ""'add',"", ""'day',"", ""'15',"", ""'days',"", ""'head',"", ""'kyoto',"", ""'via',"", ""'kanazawa',"", ""'kyoto',"", ""'osaka',"", ""'4',"", ""'2',"", ""'night',"", ""'split',"", ""'way',"", ""'whether',"", ""'worth',"", ""'move',"", ""'alternatively',"", ""'stay',"", ""'kyoto',"", ""'nights',"", ""'day',"", ""'trip',"", ""'osaka',"", ""'move',"", ""'osaka',"", ""'3',"", ""'night',"", ""'stay',"", ""'visit',"", ""'nara',"", ""'fly',"", ""'hiroshima',"", ""'outbound',"", ""'flight',"", ""'availability',"", ""'normal',"", ""'time',"", ""'hiroshima',"", ""'serve',"", ""'international',"", ""'destinations',"", ""'part',"", ""'asia',"", ""'uk',"", ""'transit',"", ""'flight',"", ""'choices',"", ""'fly',"", ""'japan',"", ""'domestically',"", ""'connect',"", ""'tokyo',"", ""'note',"", ""'tokyo',"", ""'osaka',"", ""'two',"", ""'airports',"", ""'intend',"", ""'day',"", ""'connection',"", ""'flight',"", ""'airport',"", ""'book',"", ""'flight',"", ""'ticket',"", ""'protect',"", ""'connection',"", ""'guarantee',"", ""'bag']""]",False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

tracy","for me,the price of a plane ticket is not the difference between me being financially secure or not.
so when ethiad offered a full refund or the choice to rebook in the future with no increase in fare and some ethiad credit,that’s what i chose because i knew i would return as soon as the option became available to me.
if it helped to keep airlines afloat by taking that option and not pulling my money out,then i also considered that and was happy with my individual choice.
i haven’t tied any money up in hotels because they are all payable upon arrival.
you always run the risk of having difficulties dealing with agents when you haven’t booked directly with the airline,but again that’s our individual choice of how we book.
we could go round and round defending our individual choices,as i say no right or wrong answer,as long as we are all happy, with the way we have all decided on the best way forward for us personally is,then that’s all that matters.

but in saying that, depending on when you booked your flights, even the lowest priced tickets have the option of a free change in flight date (but fare difference is applicable) so that option should be available to you if like i said you booked your flights whilst this offer was happening (which it has been for at least the last 4 months or longer).",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g293915-i3686-k13507759-Flights_for_August_2021_Singapore_airlines_won_t_refund-Thailand.html,"Flights for August 2021, Singapore airlines won’t refund",Psyvolt,0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Psyvolt?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,200,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,50,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,200,0,0,200,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,62500,"[""['thoughts',"", ""'see',"", ""'refund',"", ""'flight',"", ""'book',"", ""'expensive',"", ""'fully',"", ""'refundable',"", ""'ticket',"", ""'singapore',"", ""'airlines',"", ""'fly',"", ""'bangkok',"", ""'everyday',"", ""'choice',"", ""'right',"", ""'refund',"", ""'book',"", ""'flight',"", ""'lowest',"", ""'price',"", ""'ticket',"", ""'free',"", ""'flight',"", ""'date',"", ""'fare',"", ""'difference',"", ""'applicable',"", ""'book',"", ""'flight',"", ""'whilst',"", ""'happen',"", ""'least',"", ""'4',"", ""'months',"", ""'longer']""]",False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

thanks!",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g186338-i17-k13542697-Overnight_Layover_at_LHR_Tests_Package_Required-London_England.html,Overnight Layover at LHR - Tests Package Required?,Re2st,US,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Re2st?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,100,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,100,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,100,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,30000,"[""['hello',"", ""'i’m',"", ""'plan',"", ""'trip',"", ""'late',"", ""'november',"", ""'complete',"", ""'may',"", ""'stand',"", ""'today',"", ""'i’m',"", ""'arrive',"", ""'day',"", ""'connection',"", ""'european',"", ""'cities',"", ""'eg',"", ""'copenhagen',"", ""'book',"", ""'2',"", ""'8',"", ""'covid',"", ""'test',"", ""'package',"", ""'hotel',"", ""'directly',"", ""'airport',"", ""'flight',"", ""'morning']""]",False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

i purchased a covid test on the website (  ) to fulfill the requirement of my flight with etihad airline on 12th of january. the website as you can see advertises itself as a partner of etihad and shows compatibility with all flights of etihad.
the website is designed in a way that you pay for the test and only then you are allowed to apply for an appointment. i trusted that they are official partners of etihad airline so went ahead and paid for the test with them but when i reached appointment booking page, i couldn't find an appropriate timing during their working hours that worked for my flight. hence, i decided to reach out to them before booking the appointment and ask for advice. much to my surprise they responded that the test would not be compatible with my flight and i should change my flight to another day to be able to avail the service from their company.
disappointed by the response i asked for a refund where the company completely refused to return my money stating it is a non-refundable service. i had not even booked for an appointment yet and still they would not agree to refund, they only offered to waive off the 25 gbp required to change the test date but that is useless for me as i have not booked a test date yet.

if i understand you correctly, you recommend either bali, central java, and then gili meno (time permitting) in that order or bali, west/central flores, and then gili (time permitting) in that order? so, internationally, flying into bali and out of lombok? it's the international flights that i expect we'll want to book well in advance, so knowing where we're starting and ending the trip is more critical.
it sounds like java would be interesting for a different perspective and culture. what, in your own opinion, would be the interests/reasons for visiting western and central flores (beyond seeing the komodos, of course!)?

i know it is over a year away but i am so excited and once i get the planning part done i can put it on the shelf until closer to the time. all the accommodations booked will be free cancellation, but as soon as i can i want to secure something.
i think next year will be a very busy travel year for everyone.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g294226-i7220-k13565579-Does_this_sound_too_rushed-Bali.html,Does this sound too rushed?,travelling55,AU,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelling55?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,100,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,100,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,20000,"[""['wow',"", ""'much',"", ""'suggestions',"", ""'information',"", ""'husband',"", ""'tube',"", ""'videos',"", ""'photos',"", ""'entire',"", ""'trip',"", ""'two',"", ""'weeks',"", ""'leg',"", ""'wonder',"", ""'slower',"", ""'sanur',"", ""'five',"", ""'nights',"", ""'friend',"", ""'arrival',"", ""'vancouver',"", ""'overnight',"", ""'bangkok',"", ""'may',"", ""'quite',"", ""'tire',"", ""'travel',"", ""'far',"", ""'day',"", ""'idea',"", ""'candidasa',"", ""'four',"", ""'nights',"", ""'ubud',"", ""'13',"", ""'nights',"", ""'volunteer',"", ""'teach',"", ""'2',"", ""'3',"", ""'hours',"", ""'day',"", ""'plenty',"", ""'time',"", ""'sightsee',"", ""'area',"", ""'full',"", ""'weekend',"", ""'free',"", ""'husband',"", ""'join',"", ""'second',"", ""'week',"", ""'ubud',"", ""'amed',"", ""'5',"", ""'nights',"", ""'gili',"", ""'3',"", ""'nights',"", ""'sanur',"", ""'2',"", ""'nights',"", ""'closer',"", ""'airport',"", ""'fly',"", ""'cambodia',"", ""'sanur',"", ""'worth',"", ""'visit',"", ""'twice',"", ""'place',"", ""'close',"", ""'airport',"", ""'sound',"", ""'reasonable',"", ""'away',"", ""'excite',"", ""'plan',"", ""'part',"", ""'shelf',"", ""'closer',"", ""'time',"", ""'accommodations',"", ""'book',"", ""'free',"", ""'cancellation',"", ""'soon',"", ""'secure',"", ""'something',"", ""'busy',"", ""'travel']""]",False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

it's been clarified since that it was not the flights that were banned, but (most) foreigners :)",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g294226-i7220-k13454941-Bali_is_closed_for_al_foreign_travel_until_14_Jan-Bali.html,Bali is closed for al foreign travel until 14 Jan,Pietromar,West Lafayette...,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pietromar?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,100,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,10000,"[""['pig',"", ""'aware',"", ""'indeed',"", ""'witness',"", ""'summer',"", ""'long',"", ""'flight',"", ""'sale',"", ""'trip',"", ""'3',"", ""'weeks',"", ""'line',"", ""'progressively',"", ""'cancel',"", ""'case',"", ""'flight',"", ""'bookable',"", ""'day',"", ""'doubt',"", ""'much',"", ""'cancel',"", ""'minute',"", ""'literally',"", ""'contrary',"", ""'sun',"", ""'article',"", ""'state',"", ""'international',"", ""'flight',"", ""'ban',"", ""'turn',"", ""'completely',"", ""'inaccurate',"", ""'clarify',"", ""'flight',"", ""'ban',"", ""'foreigners']""]",False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

so bali opening means little unless dot i’s cross t’s regulations countries airlines.","and following on from annemieke you also do not know how the airline will treat you. in the various panics that germany has had in shutting down countries lufthansa has misinterpreted their own countries rules. when uk was put on the red list last xmas lufthansa misinterpreted german rules and were only letting german passport holders on their uk - germany flights regardless of whether they were german residents or not. same for usa citizens. my son has an eclectic mix of employees. all munich residents. he had a uk employee who was refused boarding in manchester because he wasn’t german. he had a us employee who was refused barding in chicago because he wasn’t german. my son had to ring the foreign office to get them to contact lufthansa to get them on their flights.
and then, again we don’t know where you are from or live, for most of us not resident in asia/australia we require at least one flight change. the country where you change flights might have restrictions for you even in transit. singapore imposed this last year for all “europeans”.
and if you make the mistake of booking separate tickets (to save money) you might not be able to make your connection flight. this is because there is no guarantee your chosen airline has a transfer desk airside. this means you have to “arrive”, go through passport control , collect your bags, go through customs and re-checkin. so although you may be permitted to transfer but not enter the country (because of covid rules) then you can not make your next flight“.
singapore again is a prime example. we often use singapore airlines muc to dps. ordinarily (pre-covid) we could “arrive” in singapore (we require no visas) if we wished. we often went “down town” if we had a long layover (8hrs or so). currently not permitted to arrive.
even pre-covid a number of indian nationals have made the mistake of booking separate tickets over singapore which would require them to arrive to get the next flight. indian nationals require a visa to enter singapore.
so bali opening means little unless you can dot the i’s and cross the t’s of all the regulations from all the countries and all the airlines.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g294226-i7220-k13568860-Is_Bali_open_now_June_2021-Bali.html,Is Bali open now?...June 2021,NotaPigsty,Asia,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NotaPigsty?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,300,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,300,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,300,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,300,0,0.0,0.0,134,0,0,134,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,137956,"[""['annemieke',"", ""'airline',"", ""'treat',"", ""'various',"", ""'panic',"", ""'germany',"", ""'shut',"", ""'countries',"", ""'lufthansa',"", ""'misinterpret',"", ""'countries',"", ""'rule',"", ""'uk',"", ""'red',"", ""'xmas',"", ""'lufthansa',"", ""'misinterpret',"", ""'german',"", ""'rule',"", ""'german',"", ""'passport',"", ""'holders',"", ""'uk',"", ""'germany',"", ""'flight',"", ""'regardless',"", ""'whether',"", ""'german',"", ""'residents',"", ""'usa',"", ""'citizens',"", ""'son',"", ""'eclectic',"", ""'mix',"", ""'employees',"", ""'munich',"", ""'residents',"", ""'uk',"", ""'employee',"", ""'refuse',"", ""'board',"", ""'manchester',"", ""'wasn’t',"", ""'german',"", ""'employee',"", ""'refuse',"", ""'bard',"", ""'chicago',"", ""'wasn’t',"", ""'german',"", ""'son',"", ""'ring',"", ""'foreign',"", ""'office',"", ""'contact',"", ""'lufthansa',"", ""'flight',"", ""'don’t',"", ""'live',"", ""'resident',"", ""'asia',"", ""'australia',"", ""'require',"", ""'least',"", ""'one',"", ""'flight',"", ""'country',"", ""'flight',"", ""'restrictions',"", ""'transit',"", ""'singapore',"", ""'impose',"", ""'“europeans”',"", ""'mistake',"", ""'book',"", ""'separate',"", ""'ticket',"", ""'save',"", ""'money',"", ""'able',"", ""'connection',"", ""'flight',"", ""'guarantee',"", ""'airline',"", ""'transfer',"", ""'desk',"", ""'airside',"", ""'“arrive”',"", ""'passport',"", ""'control',"", ""'collect',"", ""'bag',"", ""'customs',"", ""'checkin',"", ""'may',"", ""'permit',"", ""'transfer',"", ""'enter',"", ""'country',"", ""'covid',"", ""'rule',"", ""'flight“',"", ""'singapore',"", ""'prime',"", ""'example',"", ""'singapore',"", ""'airlines',"", ""'muc',"", ""'dps',"", ""'ordinarily',"", ""'pre',"", ""'covid',"", ""'“arrive”',"", ""'singapore',"", ""'require',"", ""'visa',"", ""'wish',"", ""'“down',"", ""'town”',"", ""'long',"", ""'layover',"", ""'8hrs',"", ""'permit',"", ""'arrive',"", ""'pre',"", ""'covid',"", ""'number',"", ""'indian',"", ""'nationals',"", ""'mistake',"", ""'book',"", ""'separate',"", ""'ticket',"", ""'singapore',"", ""'require',"", ""'arrive',"", ""'flight',"", ""'indian',"", ""'nationals',"", ""'require',"", ""'visa',"", ""'enter',"", ""'singapore',"", ""'bali',"", ""'open',"", ""'little',"", ""'dot',"", ""'i’s',"", ""'cross',"", ""'t’s',"", ""'regulations',"", ""'countries',"", ""'airlines']""]",False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

outside of that planning a return to london / europe but no dates in mind and as that will be a big trip could be some time off.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g293915-i3686-k13547328-Proposed_2022_trips-Thailand.html,Proposed 2022 trips,Iamsuperk,AU,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Iamsuperk?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,100.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,100,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,100,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,100,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,40000,"[""['sound',"", ""'jayne',"", ""'new',"", ""'zealand',"", ""'bubble',"", ""'arrangement',"", ""'weekend',"", ""'work',"", ""'remote',"", ""'3',"", ""'weeks',"", ""'2022',"", ""'restrictions',"", ""'partner',"", ""'bali',"", ""'favourite',"", ""'place',"", ""'beach',"", ""'hop',"", ""'stay',"", ""'series',"", ""'pool',"", ""'villas',"", ""'see',"", ""'different',"", ""'areas',"", ""'indonesia',"", ""'shut',"", ""'thailand',"", ""'vietnam',"", ""'none',"", ""'pacific',"", ""'fiji',"", ""'samoa',"", ""'cook',"", ""'island',"", ""'outside',"", ""'plan',"", ""'london',"", ""'europe',"", ""'date',"", ""'mind',"", ""'big',"", ""'trip',"", ""'time']""]",False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

566,6132,TH,"often air travel people tend flight hours, international trips generally least hours altogether factor movements - checking hotel, getting airport (at least hours flight time), flight, getting next hotel, early able check yet... lose best part day. europe often switch cities train sleep way.
even domestic flights, lose fair chunk time. want places thailand malaysia, plus international locations week trip... lot time wasted transit. rule thumb experience se asia city days maximum.
also personally, wanting relax beach location, opinion need nights minimum, relaxation benefit.
just opinion .. i'd penang malaysia days, bangkok days, chiang mai days rest beach location.","often with air travel people tend to think of the flight itself which might be 1 or 2 hours, but with international trips it will generally take at least 6 hours altogether when you factor in all the movements - checking out of hotel, getting to airport (at least 2 hours before flight time), then the flight, then getting to the next hotel, and if too early you might not be able to check in yet... so really you lose the best part of a day. it's not like europe where you can often switch cities by train and sleep on the way.
even domestic flights, you lose a fair chunk of time. so if you want to go to 3 places in thailand and 2 in malaysia, plus 2 international locations in a 3 week trip... it's a lot of time wasted in transit. my own rule of thumb from my experience in se asia is 1 city each 5 days maximum.
also personally, if wanting to relax at a beach location, in my opinion you need 6 or 7 nights minimum, to really get the relaxation benefit.
just my own opinion .. i'd go to penang in malaysia for about 4 days, then bangkok 3 days, chiang mai 5 days then the rest at a beach location.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g293915-i3686-k13496214-Laos_Malaysia_Thailand_for_3_weeks_in_Jan_Feb_2022-Thailand.html,"Laos, Malaysia & Thailand for 3 weeks in Jan/Feb 2022",DragonLass-Aus,AU,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DragonLass-Aus?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,100,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,100,100,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,100,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,40000,"[""['air',"", ""'travel',"", ""'people',"", ""'tend',"", ""'flight',"", ""'1',"", ""'2',"", ""'hours',"", ""'international',"", ""'trip',"", ""'generally',"", ""'least',"", ""'6',"", ""'hours',"", ""'altogether',"", ""'factor',"", ""'movements',"", ""'hotel',"", ""'airport',"", ""'least',"", ""'2',"", ""'hours',"", ""'flight',"", ""'time',"", ""'flight',"", ""'hotel',"", ""'early',"", ""'able',"", ""'lose',"", ""'part',"", ""'day',"", ""'europe',"", ""'switch',"", ""'cities',"", ""'train',"", ""'sleep',"", ""'way',"", ""'domestic',"", ""'flight',"", ""'lose',"", ""'fair',"", ""'chunk',"", ""'time',"", ""'3',"", ""'place',"", ""'thailand',"", ""'2',"", ""'malaysia',"", ""'plus',"", ""'2',"", ""'international',"", ""'locations',"", ""'3',"", ""'week',"", ""'trip',"", ""'lot',"", ""'time',"", ""'waste',"", ""'transit',"", ""'rule',"", ""'thumb',"", ""'experience',"", ""'se',"", ""'asia',"", ""'1',"", ""'city',"", ""'5',"", ""'days',"", ""'maximum',"", ""'personally',"", ""'relax',"", ""'beach',"", ""'location',"", ""'opinion',"", ""'6',"", ""'7',"", ""'nights',"", ""'minimum',"", ""'relaxation',"", ""'benefit',"", ""'opinion',"", ""'penang',"", ""'malaysia',"", ""'4',"", ""'days',"", ""'bangkok',"", ""'3',"", ""'days',"", ""'chiang',"", ""'mai',"", ""'5',"", ""'days',"", ""'rest',"", ""'beach',"", ""'location']""]",False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

i am due to fly in 2 days and i guess my worry is that although i have a negative result and will be isolating until my flight, there is a risk of picking something up at the airport or on the plane and then testing positive on arrival and needing to quarantine in a government facility. this is making me very anxious and am now considering cancelling the trip i have so been looking forward to.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g2630221-i27069-k13457108-Second_test_on_arrival_in_DXB-Emirate_of_Dubai.html,Second test on arrival in DXB?,Julie Neill,0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JulieNeil28?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,200,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,50,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,22500,"[""['message',"", ""'facebook',"", ""'thread',"", ""'read',"", ""'today',"", ""'airport',"", ""'staff',"", ""'rule',"", ""'1',"", ""'jan',"", ""'second',"", ""'pcr',"", ""'test',"", ""'arrival',"", ""'require',"", ""'quite',"", ""'people',"", ""'everybody',"", ""'flight',"", ""'require',"", ""'retest',"", ""'arrival',"", ""'longer',"", ""'random',"", ""'sample',"", ""'tell',"", ""'staff',"", ""'airport',"", ""'negative',"", ""'pcr',"", ""'test',"", ""'uk',"", ""'longer',"", ""'accept',"", ""'differ',"", ""'view',"", ""'accept',"", ""'morning',"", ""'due',"", ""'fly',"", ""'2',"", ""'days',"", ""'guess',"", ""'worry',"", ""'negative',"", ""'isolate',"", ""'flight',"", ""'risk',"", ""'pick',"", ""'something',"", ""'airport',"", ""'plane',"", ""'test',"", ""'positive',"", ""'arrival',"", ""'quarantine',"", ""'government',"", ""'facility',"", ""'anxious',"", ""'cancel',"", ""'trip']""]",False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
