34,1215,y_0236,JP,Answer date: 2021/04/17,"Good morning, Mr. HIT-O.

I am a resident of Yokohama.
It's possible enough.
It depends on how crowded it is, but if you don't eat at the restaurant, there is a condition.

It is possible if you decide the destination in advance and go around efficiently.

As far as I read the question, I know this area in normal times (?), But what does it look like when it comes to takeout and delivery? As

you said, first of all, I think room service, You don't ask for this ""paid subscription service"".
https://www.imperialhotel.co.jp/j/tokyo/special/serviced_apartments/pdf/sva_roomservice.pdf

Even if you take out, the first thing is in and around the building.

Since you are pulling with ""Takeout"", you should be able to take out all the shops listed.

I personally think that the Imperial Hotel is a convenient and bad place (unless you move by car), but when it's near, the restaurant area of Tokyo Midtown Hibiya is relatively imaged. Of course, there are many dishes that go well with wine.

I departed from Terminal 2 once in February, and although I did sell even ""soraben"" in the departure lobby, it didn't feel like eating in the waiting room in the lobby. (At the card lounge, all drinks were poured by the staff, and there was no food, newspaper or magazine service.) Also, I took three ANA flights, but I ate other than the drinks served. The person who drinks has only seen once that a woman sitting alone in three seats was reluctant to eat rice balls.

The point is that even if you eat it, it is not delicious to eat while paying attention to the surroundings (!) (I think that it is difficult to eat at restaurants etc. considering the transit time.)

We will respond by recognizing that it is the departure lounge in Terminal 2.
I don't think it's very helpful, but there are restaurants and shops where you can buy light meals.
It's an ANA departure lobby, so if you don't have time, there are many ANA shops, so I don't think you'll have any trouble purchasing.
Mansei cutlet sandwich is a Tokyo specialty and I think it is delicious. However, I don't know what you think because I think people in Kansai are very proficient, but it

It's been almost 15 years since it opened, but it's been well maintained and has the same high-class feel as when it first opened, and I personally think it's beautiful.

I don't know if the park is open at this time of year, but the Hakone Botanical Garden is right next door. When I went in June, the flowers were in bloom and it was beautiful.

[1] Educational Forest Park → Senshunen
A park near Myogadani , where neighbors come to play with their children.
In particular, Senshunen in the back is a little careless, but it is a park full of nature, and it is a forest where Japanese pygmy woodpeckers and long-tailed tit rest their feathers.
The cherry blossoms are gathered from the university dormitory to the open space below, and bloom beautifully.
There are many famous spots in the neighborhood, Harimazaka Sakura-lined trees, but since it is located uphill and famous Japanese sweets shops are also located below,
people who come to see the cherry blossoms from other places I don't think you can come here very often.
I think it is a fairly minor spot for cherry blossom viewing.

[2] Shin-Otsuka side Minami-Otsuka 3-chome Sakura-lined street
This is Minami-Otsuka, and the station side seems to have a decent name, but the cherry blossom trees continue for a long time from the front of Otsuka station.
Avoid the Otsuka station side where there are events, etc., and access from Shin-Otsuka station.

The downhill from Nishisugamo Junior High School to Platanus Street (Famima's corner) is completely in a residential area, so almost no people flow.
The rows of trees lined up on both sides are quite good, but there aren't many restaurants in the neighborhood, and there aren't many restaurants in the neighborhood, so even if you try to eat and drink outside, you can't go through the streets, but you can only see the flowers, so the risk is low.

[3] Waseda Toyohashi
There is a row of Kanda River cherry blossom trees from Edogawabashi Station to Edogawa Park to Higo Hosokawa Garden, which is a famous place for cherry blossoms, and it is a continuation of it.
There are many people there, so if you want to avoid the crowds, don't stop by even if you make a mistake. If possible, you should avoid Edogawabashi Station and Takadanobaba Station, which is used by many people.
The row of cherry blossom trees on the Kanda River continues all the way to Takadanobaba, and is just a short walk from Waseda Station on the Toden-Arakawa Line and Toei Bus Ii 64 Grand Sakashita.
When you come to the vicinity of Toyohashi, which is just right, you can see the scenery of cherry blossoms lined up on both sides of the river, even though the number of people who bother to stop by is greatly reduced.
Some people secretly set up their cameras to take pictures of the cherry blossoms.
The cherry blossoms on both sides of the bridge are always splendid, so I can assure you that the cherry blossoms from Toyohashi will shine. In addition, there is a small park called Yamabuki no Sato Park, which is a little far from the river. It's a deep place, so only neighbors come first.
There is Daiei in the neighborhood, benches and toilets in the park, and a bakery called Kandagawa Bakery opposite, so you can take a break outdoors without getting too crowded.

What do you think.

First of all, at Akita Airport, there are three restaurants, and the important (?) Mugendo is in the departure lobby after the security inspection, and in the restaurant before the security inspection, it seems that Inaniwa udon is in ""Restaurant Sora"".

https://www.akita-airport.com/pages/shop#shop2
https://www.akita-airport.com/pages/institution-floor-2f
https://tabelog.com/akita/A0501/A050101/ 5005054 / dtlmenu /
(The structure of this airport seems to be a mechanism in which departure and arrival passengers, which are common in regional airports, walk in the same place in front of the gate. It seems impossible to ask me to enter the airport.)

Next, I have eaten ""Delicious Inaba Udon"" only at Kanbun Goden-do and Mugen-do, but both of them.
Http://Www.Kanbun5.Jp/
Http://Www.Mugendo.Jp/restaurant/index.Html
(as an aside 1665 years hall I'd have been considerably withdrawal...)
and to say, It seems that there are only shops in Akita City, which is in the opposite direction to Kakukan. In addition, Yosuke Sato, who is listed, has a shop in Kakunodate, but
https://www.sato-yoske.co.jp/shop/kakunodate/
Kakunodate is for sale only, and it seems that you cannot eat. (It seems to be in Akita City.)

I think there are other delicious Inaniwa udon restaurants, but
1. Eat at an airport restaurant.
2. Ask Google Sensei at ""Kakunodate Inaniwa Udon"" and eat at a suitable udon restaurant in Kakunodate.
3. In order to go to any of the above three places, even if it takes 30 minutes one way, from the airport, go to Akita city in the opposite direction to Kakunodate. (As expected, the authentic Yuzawa and Inaniwa are too far away ...)
Isn't it an option like that? After that, is there any good point on the roadside to Kakunodate? But I will leave this and 2 ""Kakunodate Inaniwa Udon Famous Store"" to those who are familiar with it. (I don't know if it's true or not?), But a friend from Akita said, ""There are people who say that Inaniwa udon is a specialty everywhere in Akita prefecture, but that's a mistake, because it's Yuzawa's local food (like the above three companies). (N) It's not delicious unless it's a restaurant that originated in Yuzawa. "")

I have stayed at Akayu Onsen twice.

There is Karasuhatayama Hachimangu around Akayu.
It is a shrine on a hill.

Since we were a car, we went to Akutsu Hachiman Shrine in Takahata (next station).
It's a three-storied pagoda that looks great in the picture, and there is a roadside station nearby, and
Takahata seems to be cultivating
fruits, and they sold jams and sauces using fruits.

Akutsu Hachiman Shrine

On the route of Loople Sendai, I think that Zuihoden, the statue of Masamune Date at the site of Sendai Castle, and Mediatheque will be typical spots.
Aer Observation Terrace is good around Sendai Station, but I personally recommend SS30 (Sumitomo Life Sendai Central Building) if you want to see the night view.
The stained glass inside Sendai Station is famous as a meeting spot, but if you take a closer look, it will be very beautiful.
In Sendai station gourmet, in addition to Ushitan-dori, Zunda-dori and Zunda-charo, which is famous for Zunda Shake, are famous.
Sendai station square-Ichibancho-Kokubuncho is in the center of Sendai, but it is connected by an arcade and it is fun just to walk slowly.
The gourd fried at Abe Gamo store is also famous as a friend of eating.
I personally recommend it at the restaurant, but there is a meat restaurant called ""Bisutorohei"" near Sendai Station where you can enjoy Sendai beef, which is very delicious.
Also, ""Ando"" in Ichibancho is a creative restaurant, and I think you can relax by yourself, and this is also delicious.
It's been a long time since I left Sendai, but due to the redevelopment after the earthquake, the area around Sendai Station has been reborn as a very fashionable spot, and many delicious shops have been opened.
As I was writing, I also wanted to go.

Hello Goro - chan. My name is chiaki-k and I live in Saku City.

Saku City is famous for carp farming, but there are surprisingly few shops that serve carp dishes, and
some shops have closed due to the influence of the corona, so
I think that many people have a hard time finding it . As far as I know, I recommend only two stores that are certain.
(I don't know the shops outside Saku City) The

first shop is
""Saku Hotel"" in Iwamurada City, which is the closest to Saku IC . Founded in 1428! It's a very long-established restaurant, and
I also stay overnight, but if anything, it's a restaurant that mainly serves food. This is

a venerable restaurant where celebrities such as Toson Shimazaki, Hakushu Kitahara, and Bokusui Wakayama stayed, and the
specialty is Koi Koku. I'm also good at eel dishes, so
it's okay if you tell me when you make a reservation by TEL .

The other store is a little far from the Saku IC, but this is also
""Kagetsu"" , which is mentioned by ↓ . It is a famous restaurant in Saku City, and I was
often invited to banquets and wedding receptions here .

That's all, but we recommend that you make a phone reservation in advance for both shops.

In the first place, it's a matter of argument, but I happen to go to Kofu, so if I have edible wild plants, I wonder if I should eat them. From a traveler's point of view (?), I have never heard that Kofu is particularly famous for edible wild plants (as a result of Yamanashi's obsession (?), Tuna and other sashimi are delicious ... ), If you want to eat edible wild plants, I think it's better to look around Shinjuku for delicious edible wild plants. ・ ・ ・

Below, I will list the places where there are likely to be wild plants (where I also do local cuisine during the day), but it is better to check by phone. First of all, there are the classic soba restaurants in front of the station, the classic hoto shops, ""Okuto"" and ""tenant"".
https://okutouhonten-kouhuekimae.gorp.jp/
http://www.kosaku.co.jp/tenpo-kofuekimae.html
Both of them also serve single dishes, so it may be this season. However, if it's something like ""hoto with edible wild plants,"" you may not know what the edible wild plants are. In the

station building Celeo, there is a local restaurant ""Shingen"" directly managed by Kikyoya, which is famous for ""Shingen Mochi"". It's convenient because you can drink alcohol from daytime (!), But there may be edible wild plants as the menu is abundant.
https://tabelog.com/yamanashi/A1901/A190101/19009919/

Also, I haven't been there in the daytime, but
Ichikusaan Tsumugi (a little ) may be a single item at a sake-only soba restaurant. Walk.)
Https://tabelog.com/yamanashi/A1901/A190101/19008973/
Raw soba kiri
https://kisoba-kiri-kitaguchi.gorp.jp/

There is a decent greengrocer on the first floor of the station building Celeo, but other than that, there are some greengrocers within walking distance. I don't ask. Ogino and Ichiyamamart, two major local supermarkets in Yamanashi, are also not within walking distance. In front of the station, Ogino in front of Nirasaki station, Aeon in front of Isawa Onsen station.

In the case of a car, I feel that the Fudoki no Oka Agricultural Products Direct Sales Office near the Kofu Minami Interchange is a major vegetable direct sales office.

There are few people who say that it is near Fukuromachi (I think there is no hotel, but ...) Is it ANA or Mitsui Garden Hotel on the 100-meter road (Peace Boulevard)? I might write something a little misguided. ...

Fukuromachi has two birthplaces of a famous company, one is UNIQLO's first store, the company is Yamaguchi's company, but the first store was in Fukuromachi. Unfortunately, I don't know because there is no stone monument on the site now, but ... In the old days, the logo was similar to Henkel, and it was a casual clothing store like a select shop like Right-on and Jeans Mate. The other is Andersen (Takaki Bakery), a bakery.
https://www.andersen.co.jp/hiroshima/
There is a restaurant that serves light meals here, so it's a good idea to go for lunch. The company's headquarters is located elsewhere, but it will be the first place to sell bread.

Okonomiyaki is especially popular in the center, so it's difficult to say here, so it doesn't take much to walk, so I think it's safe to go to Hatchobori's Okonomimura.

386,12911,Donbei Vagabon (Do),JP,Answer date: 2021/10/04,"Hello.

When it comes to the deliciousness of Shimane, first of all, soba. In addition, the white squid (sashimi) fried at Sakaiminato in the western part of Tottori, which has almost the same living area, is delicious, but that is only for summer, so it's a shame.
There are 50,000 shops for the soba. Among them, I will list the places that I was really happy to eat.
Matsue: Funatsu (raw flour), Kamiyo.
Yakumo-an is famous, but it falls a little (but it's enough). But the atmosphere is outstanding.
Izumo: Kanaya, Arakiya.
Okuizumo: Asahitei, Hachikawa soba (with delicious rice balls from Nita rice), demon soba.
(Tottori) Yonago: Kamidai, Shoan.
Lake Shinji is also famous for its freshwater clams, but no matter when you go to the Shijimikan, you won't find any large raw clams.
Rather, the clear white fish in the dining room called Fukukichi on the northern lakeside was delicious. It seems that there are some natural eels from Lake Shinji.
In addition, my wife says that Minami Matsue's sea bream chazuke (sea bream?) Is exquisite.
Sushi went to some decent sushi restaurants, and although it wasn't bad, there weren't many kinds of sushi, and he was frustrated. According to him, most of the good fish go to Tokyo.
For dessert, why not try Kiyomizu-dera, which is located in front of the gate of Kiyomizu-dera, which is famous for its triple tower near the mountains of Yasugi. Very normal, but not bad.

That's my poor experience. There can be a lot of differences in taste, so it's just a light reference.

Then, please make a good trip in late autumn.",Shimane gourmet.,forum,https://4travel.jp/traveler/ho-ro-sha,4trip,travel,tourism,stb,JP,https://4travel.jp/dm_shisetsu/10002696/qa/76730,52500,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,50,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,50,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,50,200,0,0,0,0,0,200,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,50,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,50,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"['hello', 'deliciousness', 'shimane', 'soba', 'addition', 'white', 'squid', 'sashimi', 'fry', 'sakaiminato', 'western', 'part', 'tottori', 'live', 'area', 'delicious', 'summer', 'shame', '50000', 'shop', 'soba', 'among', 'place', 'happy', 'eat', 'matsue', 'funatsu', 'raw', 'flour', 'kamiyo', 'yakumo', 'famous', 'fall', 'little', 'atmosphere', 'outstanding', 'izumo', 'kanaya', 'arakiya', 'okuizumo', 'asahitei', 'hachikawa', 'soba', 'delicious', 'rice', 'ball', 'nita', 'rice', 'demon', 'soba', 'tottori', 'yonago', 'kamidai', 'shoan', 'lake', 'shinji', 'famous', 'freshwater', 'clam', 'matter', 'shijimikan', 'large', 'raw', 'clam', 'clear', 'white', 'fish', 'din', 'room', 'call', 'fukukichi', 'northern', 'lakeside', 'delicious', 'natural', 'eels', 'lake', 'shinji', 'addition', 'wife', 'minami', 'matsues', 'sea', 'bream', 'chazuke', 'sea', 'bream', 'exquisite', 'sushi', 'decent', 'sushi', 'restaurants', 'wasnt', 'bad', 'werent', 'many', 'kinds', 'sushi', 'frustrate', 'accord', 'good', 'fish', 'tokyo', 'dessert', 'try', 'kiyomizu', 'dera', 'locate', 'front', 'gate', 'kiyomizu', 'dera', 'famous', 'triple', 'tower', 'near', 'mountains', 'yasugi', 'normal', 'bad', 'poor', 'experience', 'lot', 'differences', 'taste', 'light', 'reference', 'good', 'trip', 'late', 'autumn']",False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,True,False
407,13028,Tobukun,JP,Answer date: 2021/02/24,"Hello Nyanta-san. Including places I wanted to go when I traveled before but didn't.
Experience the ""Singing Dragon"" at Tatara Bridge on Ikuchi Island and Omishima. It was a pity that I couldn't experience it because I passed by car last time.
I also recommend Kosanji Temple, which Mr. Mallows says. There is a fairly high admission fee, so please enjoy yourself slowly. Lemon squash at the cafe on the Hill of Hope, which you can't miss.
Ikuchijima has almost flat coastline roads, so it's easy to ride a bicycle. Omishima has some ups and downs on the coastline road, so the uphill may be a little difficult (I will borrow an electric assist if I go next time), but the scenery is better on Omishima.
For Omishima, we also recommend Oyamazumi Shrine. The armor of the treasure hall is spectacular, and even I, who is insensitive to spiritual things, felt a mysterious feeling around Kusunoki, like a barrier. I stopped by Omishima Cycling, and the museum is a superb view. The museum of Ken Iwata and his child is also photogenic, but there is no restaurant near here, so it is better to have a meal and tea shop star in advance when cycling.

In the case of indoors, coronavirus infection prevention measures are taken, because subjectivity (?) Is also included, so I will simply write from the perspective of open air = open terrace, where there are outdoor seats. (However, there are cases where clusters have occurred outdoors, and we will leave that judgment to you.)

First of all, the Orizuru Tower cafe at the entrance of Peace Park,
https://www.orizurutower.jp/
""Handshake Cafe"" (The name is not good at this time, but ...) That's right.
http://akushucafe.com/
It seems that it is open, but please check the latest status. After all it is a cafe, and when it comes to meals, there may be pros and cons ... Go

south along the Motoyasu River and ""Cafe Ponte""
https://www.caffeponte.com/
You can have a decent meal here. I think it's a good restaurant with a cospa that locals also go to.

Also, cross the train street and it will be on the main street side, but ""dali""
https://www.dd-holdings.jp/brands/dali/
I have never entered here, so I can not say anything , I think that there are few (?) Shops in this area as open terrace shops.

If you go to Hatchobori, near the station, or Peace Boulevard, you will have more choices, so it might be a good idea to think about that. Also, the okonomiyaki restaurant was originally a dense (?) Food restaurant, and I couldn't think of a place where I had a seat outside.

There is an Italian restaurant called ""Cafe Ponte"" along the river near the Atomic Bomb Dome, and you can eat it outside. Is delicious. You should make a reservation.

I don't know about okonomiyaki in the open air, but I've always taken out from nearby stores lately. You can usually take it out anywhere, so it's hot and delicious to eat outside right after you buy it.
""Nagataya"", which is very close to Cafe Ponte, is where tourists go, but it is usually delicious even if it is eaten by locals. The eggs are intentionally made raw and I like them, but if you don't like them, have them baked hard.
I also like Goemon on the 7th floor of Bus Center Aqua.

I went to Nara in November.
I had breakfast at a kaiseki restaurant called ""YEN-"" in the Shimomikado shopping district near Kintetsu Nara Station.
It's like a restaurant that serves kaiseki cuisine at lunch and night, but breakfast is reasonably priced at 700 yen, and it feels like breakfast at an inn with plenty of vegetables. You can choose white rice or tea porridge.
However, it seems that breakfast is currently open only on Saturdays and Sundays.
http://yen-kaiseki.com/menu/morning.html

Another candidate was breakfast in the main dining room of the Nara Hotel. I gave up because the trip was during the hotel renovation, but this tea porridge seems to be famous.
However, it is quite a price for breakfast (sweat)

The neighboring citizens think that the famous sightseeing spots in Wakayama are Koyasan, Shirahama, and Nachikatsuura (Kumano Shrine).

If you take the Kishigawa Line, you will find Kishi Station, which became famous for the cat stationmaster Tama-chan. I'm back in the sky, so maybe Nitama-chan now. I don't walk that much here, so my sister might be comfortable too.
I run with Tama-chan train, strawberry train, and toy train.

In Kada, there is Awashima Shrine, which is famous for doll memorial services (they are placed by type), but since it is a fishing port, there are only shops that are famous for Shirasudon called Manko Shoten, and there is only a drop-in hot water at the hotel. By the way, a happy train is running here.

I haven't been there, but in tourist books such as a day trip drive course, Yuasa is mentioned as a town of soy sauce.
https://www.yuasa-kankokyokai.com/

Since it means ""nearby"", it is not Wakayama but Osaka, but since I went to Wakayama Castle, I went to Kishiwada in Osaka and found Kishiwada Castle. It's close to Takojizo Station on the Nankai Main Line, so it's easy to go sightseeing without a car. Although I had the opportunity to go nearby several times, I haven't had time to take a leisurely look, but the garden is beautiful. There is a restaurant called Gofuso nearby. I went to eat when I was stubborn, but the building is also a mansion and the Japanese garden is a wonderful place.
The Kishiwada Nature Museum is a short walk away. I personally rejected it, but when I looked it up later, it seemed to be quite impressive, so I said, ""I'm sorry."" I would like to go if I have the opportunity. The Danjiri Kaikan is also nearby.

If Shirahama is your destination, why not take the Panda Kuroshio, where your eyes are sitting. The schedule will come out after 18:00 the day before.
https://www.jr-odekake.net/railroad/kuroshio/pandakuroshio/ My
eyes are sitting, but every time I see it, it seems cute.

Previously, I tried to go around Tsushima in one day and couldn't go around at all (it ended only south of Watatsumi Shrine / Karasuhatake), so I went to revenge in 2 days and 1 night.

Tsushima has many ups and downs, and it takes longer to move than you can imagine by looking at a flat map.
As you mentioned, the Korean observatory located on the north side and the hill observatory where you can see foreign countries are quite far, so I think it is difficult to go around in one day.
You said that you have 2 nights and 3 days. What are you going to do on the 1st and 3rd days?
I think it's better to rent a car in full, or have a car for at least two days.

For lunch, there aren't many restaurants other than Izuhara, and I remember going to Izuhara for a meal.

Is it a ferry or an airplane? Which is your stay?
I think that the route will change a little depending on that, but since Izuhara Port and the airport are on the south side, I think that you should go around in order so as to connect the places you want to go with a line.

Tsushima has a long history and nature, so it is a very interesting place.
Banshoin Temple, Mongol Invasion Beach, Miuda Beach, and Shiine's stone roof warehouse are also beautiful and interesting.

623,21801,Mahina 's,JP,Answer date: 2021-01-04,"Hello

I don't know what the reeds in Amakusa are, but as you can imagine from the way it is written as 25 minutes from the airport, it means that you don't rent a car, right?

I didn't feel like coming because it was this time of the year, but my friend told me to come, so I'm staying in Amakusa.

It's been a long time since I went to Amakusa, and I've become like a resident, so if I don't have anything to do in Amakusa, I'll go to the airport immediately, so I just saw Mizoka (Amakusa Airlines). (Laughs) I saw it yesterday (laughs) Tomorrow I will board for the first time in a while and go home.

As far as I know, it will be Alegria or Amakusa Prince Hotel.

I stopped staying at my friend's house and stayed in Hondo, and now I'm waiting for my friend's business, so when I went to ask the tourist association in the exchange center Porto, there are only two facilities in Hondo. When.
Alegria can also take a day trip bath, so I've been there several times. It's bigger than the Prince Hotel. There are many day-trip bathers (I don't know about the visitors of this time),

but in the private bath, the Kazumijuku Affino Kaishin is located from the Hondo Bus Center to Hondo Port.
I'm curious, but I haven't stayed there yet.

This is also far away, but Matsushima is easier to access than Shimoda. It takes less than an hour from the Hondo Bus Center on the Rapid Amakusa train (there is one Amakusa train every hour, and I sometimes return to Kumamoto Station). Hot springs are also sold here. Therefore, the value is still high.
About 30 minutes from the Hondo Bus Center on the rapid train Amakusa (please check the time), there is also an inn near Shirogahama Beach in Ariake.
I don't think there is a large communal bath, but there is a hot spring facility, Sazanami no Yu, at Michi-no-Eki Lipland.
Ariakeso at the bottom of the shelf seems to have a small bath.

It depends on what you do in Amakusa and where you go, but if you don't rent a car because public transportation isn't convenient, why not stay in Hondo? The Prince Hotel has restaurants within walking distance. The sushi restaurant next door is a famous restaurant that is also covered on TV, but reservations are required. I went there once, but since it's creative sushi, I think it's okay to go elsewhere.
Alegria is located in the hotel because it is far away.
If it's just one night away, I wonder if Shirogahama Beach, Matsushima Onsen, which can be reached by the rapid Amakusa, which I wrote earlier, is good.",I'm looking for an inn with a large communal bath near Amakusa Airport,forum,https://4travel.jp/traveler/taino-okashira,4trip,travel,tourism,stb,JP,https://4travel.jp/dm_qa_each-76418.html,241600,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,80,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,500,500,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,80,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,500,0,0,0,0,0,80,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,320,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,80,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,80,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,500,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"['hello', 'reeds', 'amakusa', 'imagine', 'way', 'write', '25', 'minutes', 'airport', 'rent', 'car', 'right', 'feel', 'time', 'friend', 'tell', 'stay', 'amakusa', 'long', 'time', 'amakusa', 'become', 'resident', 'amakusa', 'ill', 'airport', 'immediately', 'saw', 'mizoka', 'amakusa', 'airlines', 'laugh', 'saw', 'yesterday', 'laugh', 'tomorrow', 'board', 'time', 'home', 'far', 'alegria', 'amakusa', 'prince', 'hotel', 'stop', 'stay', 'friends', 'house', 'stay', 'hondo', 'wait', 'friends', 'business', 'tourist', 'association', 'exchange', 'center', 'porto', 'two', 'facilities', 'hondo', 'alegria', 'day', 'trip', 'bath', 'time', 'bigger', 'prince', 'hotel', 'many', 'day', 'trip', 'bathers', 'visitors', 'time', 'private', 'bath', 'kazumijuku', 'affino', 'kaishin', 'locate', 'hondo', 'bus', 'center', 'hondo', 'port', 'curious', 'stay', 'far', 'away', 'matsushima', 'easier', 'access', 'shimoda', 'less', 'hour', 'hondo', 'bus', 'center', 'rapid', 'amakusa', 'train', 'one', 'amakusa', 'train', 'hour', 'kumamoto', 'station', 'hot', 'spring', 'sell', 'therefore', 'value', 'high', '30', 'minutes', 'hondo', 'bus', 'center', 'rapid', 'train', 'amakusa', 'time', 'inn', 'near', 'shirogahama', 'beach', 'ariake', 'large', 'communal', 'bath', 'hot', 'spring', 'facility', 'sazanami', 'yu', 'michi', 'eki', 'lipland', 'ariakeso', 'bottom', 'shelf', 'small', 'bath', 'amakusa', 'rent', 'car', 'public', 'transportation', 'isnt', 'convenient', 'stay', 'hondo', 'prince', 'hotel', 'restaurants', 'walk', 'distance', 'sushi', 'restaurant', 'door', 'famous', 'restaurant', 'cover', 'tv', 'reservations', 'require', 'creative', 'sushi', 'elsewhere', 'alegria', 'locate', 'hotel', 'far', 'away', 'one', 'night', 'away', 'wonder', 'shirogahama', 'beach', 'matsushima', 'onsen', 'reach', 'rapid', 'amakusa', 'write', 'earlier', 'good']",False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,True
637,22013,Kumakichi 's,JP,Answer date: 2021-05-12,"nice to meet you. I made a trip to Miyazaki in early April this year. I went from Haneda to and from Miyazaki Airport. I traveled from the north of Miyazaki prefecture to the south of Miyazaki prefecture in 2 days and 1 night, but the first flight was the first flight and the last flight was the return flight, so the trip was on a fairly tight schedule.

It depends on where you are going to visit, but I will introduce the routes I visited in April for reference.

Head north from Miyazaki Airport to the sea station, and tour the horseback, the sea of Cruz, and Kunimigaoka. However, it was raining heavily on the day I went, so I was almost in a glimpse of everything. If it was sunny, I was planning to stay until the evening and see the sunset in the sea of Cruz, but I realized that I couldn't do that, so in the afternoon I just drove to Miyazaki city again, and a shop slightly outside Miyazaki city. I ate dinner at. I stayed in the center of Miyazaki city.

The next day, I left the hotel after 8 am, and this time I went south to Cape Toi, Udo Shrine, Nichinan Sunmesse, and Sekinoo Waterfall for lunch near Sunmesse. I was planning to go to Horikiri Pass and Aoshima Shrine, but I didn't have time to cut it. On the second day, it rained heavily in the morning and I had to go to Cape Toi in the fog, so I couldn't see a good view, but I think it would be a great place if it was sunny. There are wild horses that cross the road normally. You need to be careful when driving, but there are promenades and lighthouses. Udo Shrine was also on a precipitous cliff, and it was quite spectacular. Sekinoo Waterfall is located near Kagoshima. There were few tourists in a slightly minor place, but you can see a fairly powerful waterfall from the suspension bridge.
By the way, at Sunmesse Nichinan, I didn't have much time to see the Moai statue, and the staying time was about 10 minutes.

If you have the energy to drive for a long time, you can go all the way from north to south, but if you only have one, I think the south is recommended in terms of sightseeing spots.
You can drive while looking at the sea in both the north and the south, but I feel that you can see the sea from a higher place in the north.

I also wrote reviews of the restaurant where I ate, so please see the page if you like.",Drive along the coast of Miyazaki prefecture (north or south of Miyazaki prefecture),forum,https://4travel.jp/traveler/yuki05,4trip,travel,tourism,stb,JP,https://4travel.jp/dm_qa_each-76548.html,55000,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,50,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,50,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,200,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,200,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,50,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,50,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,50,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,50,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"['meet', 'trip', 'miyazaki', 'early', 'april', 'haneda', 'miyazaki', 'airport', 'travel', 'north', 'miyazaki', 'prefecture', 'south', 'miyazaki', 'prefecture', '2', 'days', '1', 'night', 'flight', 'flight', 'flight', 'flight', 'trip', 'fairly', 'tight', 'schedule', 'visit', 'introduce', 'rout', 'visit', 'april', 'reference', 'head', 'north', 'miyazaki', 'airport', 'sea', 'station', 'tour', 'horseback', 'sea', 'cruz', 'kunimigaoka', 'rain', 'heavily', 'day', 'glimpse', 'sunny', 'plan', 'stay', 'see', 'sunset', 'sea', 'cruz', 'realize', 'afternoon', 'drive', 'miyazaki', 'city', 'shop', 'slightly', 'outside', 'miyazaki', 'city', 'eat', 'dinner', 'stay', 'center', 'miyazaki', 'city', 'day', 'hotel', '8', 'time', 'south', 'cape', 'toi', 'udo', 'shrine', 'nichinan', 'sunmesse', 'sekinoo', 'waterfall', 'lunch', 'near', 'sunmesse', 'plan', 'horikiri', 'pass', 'aoshima', 'shrine', 'time', 'cut', 'second', 'day', 'rain', 'heavily', 'morning', 'cape', 'toi', 'fog', 'see', 'good', 'view', 'place', 'sunny', 'wild', 'horse', 'cross', 'road', 'normally', 'careful', 'drive', 'promenade', 'lighthouses', 'udo', 'shrine', 'precipitous', 'cliff', 'quite', 'spectacular', 'sekinoo', 'waterfall', 'locate', 'near', 'kagoshima', 'tourists', 'slightly', 'minor', 'place', 'see', 'fairly', 'powerful', 'waterfall', 'suspension', 'bridge', 'way', 'sunmesse', 'nichinan', 'much', 'time', 'see', 'moai', 'statue', 'stay', 'time', '10', 'minutes', 'energy', 'drive', 'long', 'time', 'way', 'north', 'south', 'one', 'south', 'recommend', 'term', 'sightsee', 'spot', 'drive', 'sea', 'north', 'south', 'feel', 'see', 'sea', 'higher', 'place', 'north', 'write', 'restaurant', 'eat', 'see', 'page']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True

Speaking of Kumamoto ramen, is Ajisen ramen the safest? East Bypass store along Route 57.

There are several stores along Route 57 heading to Aso, so why not search for ""ramen"" on Google Maps and refer to the reviews there.

Workers will come to eat at noon on weekdays, so it may be smoother to stagger the time.

In a slightly different direction, there is Katsura Ramen in Kurokamicho, which is north of Kumamoto Castle. There is also a parking lot at the store.
https://keika-raumen.co.jp/shop_kmkt.html#kurokami
I often go to Amakusa, but on the way back, I go to Kumamoto Station's Katsura Ramen and eat it when I feel like it.

A long time ago, Kumamoto ramen from a Chinese restaurant called Ranran, which was in the Ekimachi 1-chome era, which was the predecessor of the Higo Yokamon market at Kumamoto station, was delicious. The kogashi garlic is exquisite (Kurotei was too dark ...). I'd like to eat again, but it seems that it was closed when Ekimachi 1-chome was closed.

When I was looking into it at that time, I found
that there was a room with a full windowpane where you could see the sea and a half windowpane where you couldn't see the sea while sitting on the sofa. Depending on the room peeling, I saw a comment from the roof of the restaurant that I could see the room and closed the curtain all the time.
There is a spiral staircase.

I am grateful that I was on the first floor because there was a vacancy on the day. The spiral staircase to the second floor was a big bottleneck. The sea was only a few minutes so I could go to the sea many times.
If it was on the 2nd floor, it would be troublesome and I didn't go much.

686,24390,Mahina 's,JP,Answer date: 2021-02-10,"Hello again.

I'm staying in Amakusa, but I often hang around in front of Kumamoto station.
You can use the round-trip Shinkansen from your house, but during the busy seasons such as New Year's holidays, Golden Week, and Bon Festival, the Shinkansen and the aisles are full of people, so you may return by using an airplane with a limited number of passengers. I left my acquaintance's house in Amakusa in the morning and went to Kumamoto station in the afternoon. I take the airport limousine bus from Kumamoto station around 15:00, but the road is not crowded during the busy season mentioned above. With that in mind, when I flew home on weekdays, the road was congested and I was impatient. .. .. I ran on the bus lane in the city, so I went to the airport safely without much delay.

The airport limousine bus has copied the timetable before, but the bus that stops at Kumamoto Station goes to Sakuramachi Bus Terminal.
It used to be called the Transportation Center, but since the Otoshi Sakuramachi Kumamoto opened and the bus terminal went there, the name changed to Sakuramachi Bus Terminal.
https://4travel.jp/travelogue/11546023

As I wrote earlier, there are many choices in the downtown area of the arcade area, but at Kumamoto Station, there is Higo Yokamon Market in the station building, Once Amu Plaza is built, there will be stores there as well. The number of choices is not comparable, but if you are the type of person who hesitates to enter the restaurant alone, it may be easier to enter the restaurant area in Higo Yokamon Market. Hey.
https://higo-yokamon.jp/

Amu Plaza
https://www.jrkumamotocity.com/amuventure/

You can already make a reservation for Blossom Kumamoto, which I wrote earlier. Personally, it's hard to stay because the price is higher than the JR Kyushu Hotel Kumamoto, which I used to stay at that time. .. ..

The Hakata-Kumamoto highway bus Hinokuni takes about 2 hours.
Mizuho on the Kyushu Shinkansen is Kumamoto next to Hakata, so it takes about 30 minutes.
Some Sakura stop at Shin-Tosu and Kurume.
Swallows will be at each stop, so it will take about an hour.
If you become a member of JR Kyushu and make an online reservation, you can buy it cheaply.

You may get an answer with another person.

Awao chicken in Tokushima prefecture is a brand name of chicken, and unlike general tender chicken that is shipped in about 50 days, this Awao chicken is a local chicken that is shipped in about 80 days. increase.
Since local chickens have been bred for a long time, they have elastic and satisfying meat quality.
By the way, I don't like this rubber-like texture, so I don't eat much even if the local chicken is a specialty at my travel destination.

Kagawa Prefecture's bone-in chicken is not a chicken brand, but a dish name, so you should check whether or not you will wear it because you do not know which chicken the restaurant uses.


If you go to Shikoku and eat chicken, Awao chicken is also famous, but we recommend Shimanto chicken, a brand chicken from Kochi prefecture.
Since this Shimanto chicken is a young chicken, the meat is tender and has a very fluffy texture.
At my hometown, I pay my hometown tax, and I receive this Shimanto chicken as a thank-you item for 4 kg every month on a regular flight.

Of course, bonito is famous in Kochi prefecture, but the bonito season is spring and autumn.
Besides bonito, tuna and Thai are also very delicious.
Tuna is sometimes given as a hometown tax refund, but it is no different from the famous places in other prefectures.


The answer was a little off, but I hope it helps.

I used to live in Tokushima City.

There are many yakitori
restaurants in Tokushima City, and there are many popular restaurants, so Awao
chicken is probably yakitori.
I think there are other cooking methods, but Awao
chicken is the image of yakitori. In Tokushima.
It's a yakitori skewered, not with bones.

Kagawa's bone-in chicken originated in Marugame's Ikkaku Marugame, and has a chick and a parent bird, so
it feels like roast chicken.

The cooking method is completely different, so
I don't think they are wearing the same chicken at all.

In Tokushima, Donari Udon noodles are also famous.
It's like having udon in a tub boiled.

Iya's soba rice porridge and Iya soba are also specialties.

In Ehime, Jakoten.
Kochi has Susaki's nabeyaki ramen, Muroto's whale dishes, and

said to have originated from ""Local gourmet in Marugame City, Kagawa Prefecture, where chicken bone-in thigh meat is roasted "" in the reference URL, and is limited to bone-in thigh meat.
Other than the origin store and other than Marugame, there may be various differences in seasoning.

Although you may have considered it, the sea bream also has a season, and if it is a natural Thai, the taste seems to drop from spring to summer after spawning.","About ""chicken"" in Kagawa and Tokushima",forum,https://4travel.jp/traveler/kt1000,4trip,travel,tourism,stb,JP,https://4travel.jp/dm_qa_each-76668.html,27500,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,50,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,50,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,200,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,50,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"['chicken', 'much', 'specialist', 'tokushimas', 'awao', 'chicken', 'name', 'locally', 'improve', 'local', 'chicken', 'breed', 'cook', 'restaurant', 'matter', 'cook', 'part', 'bone', 'thigh', 'meat', 'ingredient', 'awao', 'chicken', 'dish', 'awao', 'chicken', 'hand', 'kagawas', 'bone', 'bone', 'bird', 'originate', 'local', 'gourmet', 'marugame', 'city', 'kagawa', 'prefecture', 'chicken', 'bone', 'thigh', 'meat', 'roast', 'reference', 'url', 'limit', 'bone', 'thigh', 'meat', 'origin', 'store', 'marugame', 'may', 'various', 'differences', 'season', 'may', 'sea', 'bream', 'season', 'natural', 'thai', 'taste', 'drop', 'spring', 'summer', 'spawn']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False

The mountains surrounding the city of Kamakura are also commonly referred to as the ""Kamakura Alps"", but is the highest altitude of this course around 160m?

The signposts are solid, and there are many roads that go down to the city on the way.

However, it is not a rainy day, a day after rain, or a day of frost columns, but the road is dry, non-slippery, and you are wearing solid shoes.
A few years ago, heavy rains destroyed the road and closed it for a long time.

It is out of the question to carry luggage in your hand, so carry it on your back with a backpack and leave both hands free.

Also, if you are traveling with an infant, consider the distance and speed based on the weakest person.

like your trip to Ogasawara.
If I have the time and money, I also want to live.

You should definitely go to the South Island. There are many tour agencies, so please check the websites and pamphlets of the tourist association in advance.
The tourist association site is
https://www.ogasawaramura.com/play/
Some vendors are also posted. For

land people, I also recommend Mr. Itacho.
Parents and children are doing small things, so I think it's one group a day.
I think my son is the main one at the moment, but he is knowledgeable anyway. And very kind.
I liked the daytime battlefield tour so much that I asked for a night tour of the day.
It is the state at that time.

also report on the South Island (+ Dolphin Swim) tour, but since this was a trader who was not very impressed, the name is hidden (laugh) In a

I'm not a local, but ... I'm sure, I'm staying at a hotel near Mito Station and going to Kairakuen (I think Gokoku Shrine is like Kairakuen in a broad sense). Is that all right? I think

that 400 yen for a bus refers to this ""Mito Manyu 1-day free ticket"", but with the intention of wandering around the city, when you arrive at Kairakuen, It looks like you should walk inside without permission.
http://www.ibako.co.jp/regular/ticket/mito-free.html

Probably HIT-O's schedule is to wander around Kairakuen (including going to Gokoku Shrine). ) I think it's better to focus on it, so I think it's better to rent a bicycle (assuming the weather is nice).
https://tabi-rin.com/archives/bicycle_info/4142
https://tabi-rin.com/archives/bicycle_info/31427

If you rent it at the south exit, you can return it at the Senba Lake West parking lot. If you are exhausted in paradise (!), You may return it at the Senba Lake West Parking Lot and return by train. As you said, it seems that the distance from the station to Kairakuen is about 2 km, but if you run along the Sakura River (I've only seen it from the train window ...), the road is simple and it's not that difficult. I do not think.

65,2544,masapi,JP,Answer date: 2021/04/11,"Hello.

I'm not a local, but when I lived in the metropolitan area before, I often went on business trips to Mito city, so I will answer as much as I can understand.

＞ Bus 1-day pass 400 yen
＞ Not all route maps are shown on the bus company's web ...

Mito Manyu 1-day free ticket
http://www.ibako.co.jp/regular/ticket/mito-free.html

Mito Manyu 1-day free ticket application route map
http://www.ibako.co.jp/Images/manyu-2019_map.png

By the way, the fare between Mito Station and Korakuen on the bus is 240 yen, so Mito Manyu 1-day free ticket The use is certainly profitable.

＞ Bus 400 yen and rental bicycle 500 yen If the

weather is not bad, the rental cycle is more flexible, but as the previous respondent said, there are some undulations in the city (the central area of the downtown area is slightly higher).

Kairakuen is the most convenient place to use the Kairakuen bus stop when using the bus, but since there is no nearest bus stop at Ibarakiagatama Shrine (Sakurayama bus stop if you use it forcibly), go after sightseeing in Kairakuen. Or vice versa, but it is convenient to have a rental cycle because there is a reasonable distance between them and the Kairakuen area is vast.

> 2km or more ... It

means going from Mito station at the distance of Kairakuen from Mito station, right? ??
If so, it depends on the route, but the shortest is certainly 2km.

By bus, it takes about 15 minutes from Mito Station North Exit Bus Stop to Kairakuen Bus Stop.

My personal conclusion is that if the weather is good and the temperature is good for the questioner, it is better to rent a bicycle, and if the weather is not good and the temperature is low, it is better to use the bus.

However, Kairakuen is a vast garden, so depending on the area you are watching, I think you can walk quite a bit here alone.","I'd like to go to Kairakuen or Gokoku Shrine, which is a one-day bus pass or a rental bicycle?",forum,https://4travel.jp/traveler/masapi,4trip,travel,tourism,stb,JP,https://4travel.jp/dm_shisetsu/11290720/qa/76520,47956,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,134,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,300,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,134,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"['hello', 'local', 'live', 'metropolitan', 'area', 'business', 'trip', 'mito', 'city', 'much', '＞', 'bus', '1', 'day', 'pass', '400', 'yen', '＞', 'route', 'map', 'show', 'bus', 'company', 'web', 'mito', 'manyu', '1', 'day', 'free', 'ticket', 'http', 'wwwibakocojp', 'regular', 'ticket', 'mito', 'freehtml', 'mito', 'manyu', '1', 'day', 'free', 'ticket', 'application', 'route', 'map', 'http', 'wwwibakocojp', 'image', 'manyu', '2019mappng', 'way', 'fare', 'mito', 'station', 'korakuen', 'bus', '240', 'yen', 'mito', 'manyu', '1', 'day', 'free', 'ticket', 'profitable', '＞', 'bus', '400', 'yen', 'rental', 'bicycle', '500', 'yen', 'weather', 'bad', 'rental', 'cycle', 'flexible', 'previous', 'respondent', 'undulations', 'city', 'central', 'area', 'downtown', 'area', 'slightly', 'higher', 'kairakuen', 'convenient', 'place', 'kairakuen', 'bus', 'stop', 'bus', 'nearest', 'bus', 'stop', 'ibarakiagatama', 'shrine', 'sakurayama', 'bus', 'stop', 'forcibly', 'sightsee', 'kairakuen', 'vice', 'versa', 'convenient', 'rental', 'cycle', 'reasonable', 'distance', 'kairakuen', 'area', 'vast', '2km', 'mito', 'station', 'distance', 'kairakuen', 'mito', 'station', 'right', 'route', 'shortest', '2km', 'bus', '15', 'minutes', 'mito', 'station', 'north', 'exit', 'bus', 'stop', 'kairakuen', 'bus', 'stop', 'personal', 'conclusion', 'weather', 'good', 'temperature', 'good', 'questioner', 'rent', 'bicycle', 'weather', 'good', 'temperature', 'low', 'bus', 'kairakuen', 'vast', 'garden', 'area', 'watch', 'walk', 'quite', 'alone']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True

Tenzan Onsen is a shuttle bus (100 yen one way) from Hakone Yumoto Station.

There are two hot springs, Tianshan and Ikyu, and there are also restaurants.

On weekdays, you can pay 1,300 yen at Tianshan and pay an additional 100 yen to

get a rest with a ladder bath ticket.

It's close to Hakone Yumoto Station, so you can easily go there.

There are many inns in Hakone where you can take a day trip hot spring bath, so you certainly get lost.

I don't know if OE-343 is particular about the quality of the spring, but I am particular about the quality of the spring (I like hot springs that are like hot springs, such as white nigori-yu such as sulfur springs). Yes, I stay at an inn with such a hot spring, or take a day trip hot spring bath.

Meanwhile, it is recommended to take a day trip hot spring bath at an inn in Sengokuhara, where there are many hot springs of such spring quality in Hakone (in my opinion).

I don't know if it's not crowded or if it's flowing, but the following site will be helpful.

I don't know if it's recommended to travel alone for girls, but ""WeBase Kamakura Resort"" is located on the coast between Yuigahama Station and Yuigahama Beach on the Enoshima Electric Railway, and a 3-minute walk from Yuigahama Station. ""Hotel & Hostel"" seems to be convenient.

Depending on your budget, there are private rooms (twin, single with toilet) and female-only dormitory.

99,4419,Passion K 's,JP,Answer date: 2021-03-02,"Hello Hide.

In January 2020, I went to Chichijima using the Ogasawara Maru.
To be honest, it depends on the wave.
The trip was calm from beginning to end. The departure was delayed by 30 minutes due to the loading of luggage, but I arrived at Chichijima on time.

The weather was nice on the way back, but the open sea was rough due to the low pressure. Therefore, it arrived 3 hours late.

https://4travel.jp/travelogue/11594177

↑ This is my return trip, but I have attached a link to the youtube video of the person who took a picture of the Ogasawara Maru I boarded from Chichijima. I think you can imagine how much the wave was, so please refer to it.

According to the people on the island, this time it was called a dog ship, and after this voyage, Ogasawara Maru set sail for a month because it was time to enter the dog for hull maintenance, but it would be strange if it was canceled normally. I said no.

Conversely, if it is only waves, I think that the delay of about 3 hours is the maximum. However, if this rain is involved, the delay may be even greater.

Again, it depends on the waves.",About arrival time at Ogasawara Maru,forum,https://4travel.jp/traveler/dansan,4trip,travel,tourism,stb,JP,https://4travel.jp/dm_qa_each-76482.html,40000,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,100,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,100,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,100,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,100,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"['hello', 'hide', 'january', '2020', 'chichijima', 'ogasawara', 'maru', 'honest', 'wave', 'trip', 'calm', 'begin', 'end', 'departure', 'delay', '30', 'minutes', 'due', 'load', 'luggage', 'arrive', 'chichijima', 'time', 'weather', 'way', 'open', 'sea', 'rough', 'due', 'low', 'pressure', 'therefore', 'arrive', '3', 'hours', 'late', 'https', '4traveljp', 'travelogue', '11594177', '↑', 'trip', 'attach', 'link', 'youtube', 'video', 'person', 'picture', 'ogasawara', 'maru', 'board', 'chichijima', 'imagine', 'much', 'wave', 'refer', 'accord', 'people', 'island', 'time', 'call', 'dog', 'ship', 'voyage', 'ogasawara', 'maru', 'set', 'sail', 'month', 'time', 'enter', 'dog', 'hull', 'maintenance', 'strange', 'cancel', 'normally', 'conversely', 'wave', 'delay', '3', 'hours', 'maximum', 'rain', 'involve', 'delay', 'may', 'greater', 'wave']",True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True

However, weather issues must be considered.
It is expected that the same conditions as the weather from today to tomorrow will be from 3/6 to 3/7.
Departing from Chichijima and arriving in Tokyo, today's wave forecast predicts 4m near Chichijima. It will operate, but considerable shaking is expected. It seems that it is operating today, so there will be no cancellation.

From Osaka, you can access the Chuo Expressway from Osaka and Kusatsu from around Lake Suwa.

It's true that the highways in Nagano turn white, so I think it's difficult in the fall and winter in that area, but from Kansai, Gunma is next to Nagano, so I don't think I'll bother to go through Yamanashi.

I think I took the train to the hot spring exit station and went by bus.

However, from the perspective of the enjoyment of driving on a sunny day, it is hard to throw away via the Chuo Expressway.
Especially on sunny days such as November when fresh snow accumulates on the mountains and April and May when there is remaining snow, we recommend the scenery via the Chuo Expressway. Fresh green and autumn leaves.

① Usually, it will be a highway via Koshoku JCT. The view of the Asama mountain range and the Northern Alps in the morning sun has the effect of relieving fatigue.

② Chubu Odan Expressway From Sakuminami IC to National Highway 254/142 via New Wada Tunnel Okaya IC is an easy-to-run road with many large trucks.

③ If you have time from early summer to autumn, it is good to cross the mountain from the Chubu Odan Expressway Yachiho Kogen IC to the Suwa IC on National Route 299 Mugiso Pass.

I live in Ehime prefecture, but I often go from northern Kanto to Tohoku by taking a flight to Fukushima via Itami. Originally I used to go mountain climbing, but recently I've been traveling a lot on a drive.

Fukushima Airport is vacant, and I always plan to enjoy it mainly in the southern part of Tohoku if I use it well. Itami-Fukushima is also quite good with a small jet.

Fukushima Airport is very convenient because I use a rental car, but if you don't drive a car, take a limousine bus from Fukushima Airport to Koriyama, then take the Shinkansen to Utsunomiya and take the JR to Nikko. I think it's about an hour and a half from Koriyama.

From the answer to the answer first, since the Tadami Line is only a regular train, basically no reservation is required. I think that the information in the travel guide is probably a special train that runs at some times.

Also, did you know that the Tadami Line is currently out of service between Aizu-Kawaguchi and Tadami due to heavy rain damage, and is acting as a bus agent? Do you go from the Koide side or the Aizuwakamatsu side?

Zao Onsen is a wonderful place.
It's okay because it won't snow yet in early November.
It's not that hard.
It's okay if you can drive normally. The

autumn leaves are around the end of the pot, but I think the lower one is in full bloom.
You can go by car, park at the parking lot and take the ropeway to the Okama.

The road is narrower at Ginzan Onsen.

Keep it on.

fog often appears.

When the fog comes out, I can't really see the front and I can hardly see the road, so
I feel like I'm going to rely on the lights of the car in front of me, which is scary.
I'm scared and want to park the car, but when I park it, I'm hit from behind, so I have
to move slowly.

I have lived in Aomori and Niigata, and I have been to the mountains of Tohoku quite a bit, but when the
weather is bad, fog often appears.
If you're not very confident in driving, I think the bus is safe.

I think it's best to leave your luggage and go out by bus for consecutive nights around Yamagata Station.

If it is a holiday on November 3, you can take a bus from Yamagata Station to the summit of Katta (Okama) via Zao Onsen.
On weekdays, there seems to be no bus that goes to the summit of Mt. Karita.

Bus timetable
http://www.yamakobus.co.jp/rosenbus/jikoku/frame/zao-onsen.html From

""Jizo Sancho Station"" on the Zao Ropeway,
you can go to the pot on the summit of Karita by trekking for 4 hours. can.
However, there is a risk of bears as you walk the mountain for 4 hours round trip.

There are about 3 ropeway companies around Zao Onsen, and the
destinations are different, so be careful.

I went to Jizo Sancho Station by ropeway 6 years ago, but at
that time, I
couldn't go to Katta Sancho because of the volcanic gas .
The travel report at that time is left as a draft.
I went to Kama before that when I stayed at Miyagi Zao Royal Hotel
.
The weather was nice, so it looked beautiful.
But when the fog comes out, I can't see the pot at all.

178,6546,Rei125,JP,Q & A Posted: 2021/10/19,"I'm planning to go sightseeing in Fukushima alone on weekends (or departure on Friday) for 2 days and 1 night (first week of November).

There are two main destinations:
・ Ouchi-juku
/ Tono-Hetsuri I

live in the west of Saitama and arrive at Yunokami Onsen Station, the nearest station to Ouchi-juku, at about 13:00 at the earliest.
If you take a bus from there to Ouchi-juku,
do you have time to go sightseeing in Ouchi-juku and then go to Tono-Hetsuri?
I like photography, and as a sightseeing pattern, I have the image of going around while taking pictures and videos.
Especially in November, the sun sets early, so is it realistic to allocate time like 1330-1530
: Ouchi-juku
1530-1700: Tono-Hetsuri
?
Actually, I would like to take a leisurely stroll in Ouchi-juku, but ...

and I haven't decided where to stay that night yet.
Because I'm wondering where to go sightseeing the next day.
Goshikinuma? Or maybe I'd like to go to Aizuwakamatsu, but I think the
most accessible place is the best, so I'd appreciate any advice.

Also, I think that the plans for the first day and the second day may be reversed at all.
I wonder if Ouchi-juku is better on the second day after going somewhere first. .. When.
Even if it's one night, you will need a place to store your luggage as you will be traveling with your luggage. ..
Is there a place to store my luggage at Ouchi-juku?

----------------------------------
■ Plan A: Ouchi-juku on the first day (Luggage deposit at Ouchi-juku?)
----------------------------------
Morning ~ 1300: Home → Station Yunokami Onsen Station
Bus departure time ~ 1530: Ouchi-juku
1530 ~ 1700: Tono-Hetsuri
1700 ~: To the accommodation

----------------------------------
■ Plan B: Sightseeing in another place on the first day
---------------------------------- The
next day on the first day Choose a place with easy access to Ouchi-juku as a sightseeing spot
. Leave your luggage at your accommodation and go sightseeing.
After checking out on the second day, leave your luggage and head to Ouchi-juku.
On the way back, I will pick up my luggage and return to Tokyo.
Therefore, the point is to choose a route that makes it easy to return to Tokyo.

Another candidate is not decided, so if you have any suggestions, it would be helpful.

You don't have to be a hot spring inn because you are alone.
There is no problem with an ordinary business hotel.

Day 2 ... Take the bus bound for Ouchi-juku at 9:00 or 10:15 from Yunokami Onsen Station. (It is assumed that the accommodation on the eve will be from the Aizu Tajima side in time for this bus.) Return to Yunokami Onsen Station, wander around the tower as appropriate, and then return on the Tobu Line.

182,6551,Nukumi Raku,JP,Answer date: 2021/10/19,"Hello.

You can use public transportation instead of a car. In that case, I think that it is definitely more relaxing to go sightseeing on the second day than to go to Ouchi-juku on the first day.

The other tourist destination is a place with good access, so I think it is safe to go sightseeing in the Aizuwakamatsu area, just like the answer from the other party.

On the first day, take the Shinkansen from Omiya to Koriyama, then take the Ban-Etsusai Line to Aizuwakamatsu in just over two hours, so you'll be in time for lunch.

If you arrive at that time and stay at Vijiho in the city, you can relax and enjoy yourself even if you hang around Mt. Iimori and Tsuruga Castle.

On the second day, board the Aizu Wakamatsu train before 8 o'clock and transfer to the bus bound for Ouchijuku at Yunokami Onsen. You can arrive at Ouchi-juku after 9 o'clock. After that, how much will you enjoy as long as time permits? It will be like that.
(Personal ride in 14:26 shot hot spring Yunokami in (the tower to fishing 14:32 shots) → recommended route that the transfer to express Liberty from Aizutajima)

previously Ouchi inn in one night and two days from Tokyo for reference I will post a travel report when I went sightseeing.

(Unfortunately, the direct bus to Aizuwakamatsu → Ouchi-juku / Ouchi-juku → Shirakawa used in the travel report has disappeared, so please be careful.)",Please give us some advice on sightseeing in Fukushima on a solo trip.,forum,https://4travel.jp/traveler/m115-1040,4trip,travel,tourism,stb,JP,https://4travel.jp/dm_shisetsu/10006456/qa/76756,35000,50,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,50,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,50,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,50,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,50,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,50,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,200,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"['hello', 'public', 'transportation', 'instead', 'car', 'case', 'relax', 'sightsee', 'second', 'day', 'ouchi', 'juku', 'day', 'tourist', 'destination', 'place', 'good', 'access', 'safe', 'sightsee', 'aizuwakamatsu', 'area', 'party', 'day', 'shinkansen', 'omiya', 'koriyama', 'ban', 'etsusai', 'line', 'aizuwakamatsu', 'two', 'hours', 'time', 'lunch', 'arrive', 'time', 'stay', 'vijiho', 'city', 'relax', 'hang', 'mt', 'iimori', 'tsuruga', 'castle', 'second', 'day', 'board', 'aizu', 'wakamatsu', 'train', '8', 'oclock', 'transfer', 'bus', 'bind', 'ouchijuku', 'yunokami', 'onsen', 'arrive', 'ouchi', 'juku', '9', 'oclock', 'much', 'long', 'time', 'permit', 'personal', 'ride', '1426', 'shoot', 'hot', 'spring', 'yunokami', 'tower', 'fish', '1432', 'shots', '→', 'recommend', 'route', 'transfer', 'express', 'liberty', 'aizutajima', 'previously', 'ouchi', 'inn', 'one', 'night', 'two', 'days', 'tokyo', 'reference', 'post', 'travel', 'report', 'sightsee', 'unfortunately', 'direct', 'bus', 'aizuwakamatsu', '→', 'ouchi', 'juku', 'ouchi', 'juku', '→', 'shirakawa', 'travel', 'report', 'disappear', 'careful']",False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True
196,7225,Ara- san,JP,Answer date: 2021-09-24,"It seems unlikely that there will be snow for five days from November 1st.
But just in case, you should request studless tires for your rental car.

In November, it's possible that ""I don't usually accumulate, but I do.""
I myself went to Fukushima for cherry blossom viewing in mid-April and had snow on the flat ground.
As expected, the tires were normal at that time, and the inn said,
""All the locals are
normal tires at this time.""
The other cars also had normal tires, and everyone was driving with a lot of space between them.

Even if there is no snow in Zao Onsen, it is better to stop it.
According to the snow country, ""The scariest thing at the beginning of the rain is the
freezing called Black Ice Burn.
If I thought it was because there was no snow, it was frozen and slipped.""
That seems to be the scariest thing. is.
Zao has a high altitude, and the return trip is downhill.

What is the ruins? I thought, but is it the site of Sendai Castle?
The site of Sendai Castle is on a hill, so if you ride a bicycle, you will have to climb a slope.

The site of Sendai Castle has only a statue of Date Masamune, and there is nothing really.
It's better to take a picture of the statue.

When it comes to the Date clan, the Zuihoden, a mausoleum of the Date clan, is worth seeing.

If you can get on a boat in Goshikinuma, November 3rd will be a holiday,
It's also the time of autumn leaves, so it's crowded waiting for the boat.
If you take a one-way bus to get back to the parking lot by walking around Goshikinuma, you should
take 2 hours for walking and 1 hour for waiting for a boat and boarding a boat for
3 hours.

If so, go to Goshikinuma from Sendai Airport on the first day and stay at Aizuwakamatsu.
Wappameshi is a specialty of Aizuwakamatsu, and there is a shop called Takino.

Kitakata ramen has an early morning business called morning ramen, so
why not go there the next morning?

If you are staying around Yamagata Station, we recommend Kajo Park.
There is a remains of an old hospital called Yamagata City Folk Museum in the park, and
it looks like an Instagram with a retro atmosphere.
The walls of the moat are not old, but they are beautiful.

If you go to Kitakata and like sake, Yamatogawa Sake Brewery has
Kasmochi Hara Sake, a super sweet
fruity sake with a sake degree of -20, so you should buy it.
Whenever I go to Kitakata, I will definitely buy it.
I used to sell it at the roadside station, but I'm sure you can buy it at the store.

197,7226,Akemi 's,JP,Answer date: 2021-09-24,"There are some things I don't understand about the schedule.
I am a little familiar with Sendai, so I only mention Sendai.
・ Where is the site of Sendai?
I heard that you are thinking about Loople Sendai, so I think it is the site of Sendai Castle.
If you are thinking of renting a bicycle to the site of Sendai Castle, it will take time to ride a bicycle, and eventually it will be a steep uphill.
It looks close on the map, but if you are not very confident in your leg strength, I think it is safer to stop.
I think it would be equipped with electric assist, but the roads around the Sendai Castle Ruins are narrow, so I think it's a little dangerous.
It's a little far from Sendai, but how about the route because there is a subway station called International Center?
・ What is Aoyama Park?
It is true that there is a park called Aoyama Park in Sendai City, but I think it's just a park, though it's not strange, and it's a place to visit for sightseeing. ..
Is it Aobayama Park? If so, I think that the access is almost the same as the Sendai Castle Ruins.
・ I'm Tanya Zenjiro, but I don't think it's necessary to make a reservation from a personal point of view, but I'm not sure how popular it is at the moment, so I'll refrain from answering.
I'm sorry.
However, I don't know how long it will take at other tourist spots, and I think it's a land I'm not used to, so I was worried about whether I could go exactly at the reserved time.
I made a reservation for that point, and if I was late, I wondered if it would be okay.
・ At 11/2, he said he was worried about driving in the snow, but I think it's okay at this time of year.
Probably, I think it's okay to recognize that the snow may flicker a little.

It's badly written, but there are many unclear points in the schedule, and I'm sorry that I can only answer like this.

I went to Tsuru no Maihashi in October of the year before last.

Since I am also traveling by public transportation, I stayed at Tsugaru Fujimisou, where I can pick up and drop off.
We picked you up at the nearest station, Mutsu-Tsuruda Station.

There was an alumni association, and I could only get a Western-style room, but I don't think it's a room on the Tsuru no Maihashi side unless it's a Japanese-style room.
I hope it will be confirmed at the time of booking.

It's a national lodging, but it was nice to be at home.
There is also a hot spring. .. ^^ When

I booked Tsugaru Fujimisou, the Gono Line Resort Shirakami wasn't on sale yet, and when I calculated the arrival time back, I could only move by taxi from Kawabe Station. .. I was giving up.
When I contacted the hotel, I received a reply saying that I wouldn't pay @ 5,000 yen from Kawabe Station.

On the day of the event, I got the Resort Shirakami and even though I called the hotel, they were happy to pick me up.

When you leave Hirosaki on the Gono Line, apple fields spread out on both sides, but I think it was around Hayashizaki Station, but it's an apple field right next to the railroad track, so if you have time, why don't you get off? !!

I also want to go to Aomori again during the apple blossom season! ^^

Please enjoy your trip.

The nearest to Lake Towada is Towada IC.

Why don't you take the plunge and change a part of the high-speed route to Hachimantai Aspite Line Drive?

It takes about 40 minutes directly from Matsuo Hachimantai IC to Towada IC on the way.

From Matsuo Hachimantai IC, get off the road and take the Hachimantai Aspite Line (reference URL) via the Hachimantai mountaintop parking lot, exit to Kazuno Hachimantai IC on the Akita prefecture side and return to high speed, and it takes 105 minutes to reach Towada IC in nab time. It's vacant, so I think I'll be able to wear it a little sooner.

If it is sunny, the forest limit is low, so the scenery is continuous on the way.

I think bears are in the mountains, so I
have no choice but to buy a bear bell at an outdoor specialty store.

I think the plan for the second day is a little time-consuming. I think
that bears are worried about flying when
departing from western Japan, but in
Tohoku, sunset is 30 minutes to an hour earlier in November than in western Japan.

I am from Osaka and have lived in Tohoku, but I
feel that the sunset in winter is early .
Came Kochi friends in early November, the airplane is late,
become the airport arrival at around 17,
at the rent-a-car use, but it was a hotel meeting
with the ""17 o'clock of darkness to"" phone in half crying state I have done it.

If I had Yonezawa beef lunch and went to Zao Onsen, it would be
just before sunset by the time I arrived at Goshikinuma.

Goshikinuma is also large, so it takes about 2 hours to walk.
So if you go to Goshikinuma, it will be the third day.

Also, there is a concern about snow at Zao Onsen in November.
Perhaps it is a rental car that can go around this area, but do you have
experience driving on snowy roads?
It seems that the Zao Echo Line may also be closed in early November.

If you have no experience driving on snowy roads, it is safe to stop renting a car in November.

If you are in Sendai, Matsushima, or Akiho Onsen, you can also go by public transportation.
If you use the Shinkansen, you can also go sightseeing in Yamagata and Fukushima.

It may be better to reconsider the sightseeing plan a little.

231,7584,Wanderer 's,JP,Answer date: 2021-07-15,"The distance is probably by plane, but I live in the
Tokyo metropolitan area, but my specialty of day trips is to get on the highway before 4 o'clock and return home in the bright light.

By this time, it will be bright enough at 4 o'clock and bright until about 19:00, so it is safe to drive. Another advantage is that there is no traffic jam on the outbound route.

In addition, you can use a 30% discount at midnight on the expressway (including around Tokyo).
The highway fee will not be stupid when it gets far away. (In the old days, it was a 50% discount.)

Then there are 15 hours, and if you are in the field for 4 hours, you will have 5 and a half hours one way.

For example, if you go to Hakone, if you leave the Sendai Minami IC at 4 o'clock in Navitime, it will take just over 5 hours to reach Hakone Sengokuhara. I think it's quite possible if you can minimize your breaks or return home after 19:00.
Hakone is best if the tourist facilities are compact and sunny.

(By the way, the record of a day trip by car of I was a long time ago, when the expressway was a special discount of up to 1,000 yen, I went from Nerima IC on the Kan-etsu Expressway to Tateyama Station in Toyama Prefecture in just over 5 hours, and by
cable car Bijodaira, I remember taking a day trip to Murodo by bus, enjoying a bath at Raichosawa Onsen, and enjoying the scenery of Mt. Tateyama and the grouse playing in the snowy valley. As
expected, the return trip was dark from around Saku.)

I will respond with my own feeling.

We are planning November-December, but
November may be the last chance as there are still some autumn leaves.
December-March is a concern for snow, so if you are not confident in driving on winter roads, we
cannot recommend it. Kesennuma is worried about the road to Sendai even if it doesn't rain.
After March, the cherry blossoms on Oshima (there
is also a rare species of Gyoikou ) will bloom from late April to early May, and it may be in time for the end of the cherry blossoms in the United States (mid-April).
Sakura looks great on a samurai residence in Tome.
To be honest, without greenery and cherry blossoms, all the scenery feels a little lonely.

In any case, the end of the corona is an issue.
Please make a judgment while carefully watching the situation .
The sea and greenery are the most beautiful in the fresh green season (after GW), and there
may be few people .",About sightseeing time,forum,https://4travel.jp/traveler/q-tarou,4trip,travel,tourism,stb,JP,https://4travel.jp/dm_qa_each-76699.html,10000,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,100,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"['hello', 'buono', 'q', 'taro', 'live', 'sendai', 'respond', 'feel', 'plan', 'november', 'december', 'november', 'may', 'autumn', 'december', 'march', 'concern', 'snow', 'confident', 'drive', 'winter', 'roads', 'cannot', 'recommend', 'kesennuma', 'worry', 'road', 'sendai', 'rain', 'march', 'cherry', 'blossom', 'oshima', 'rare', 'species', 'gyoikou', 'bloom', 'late', 'april', 'early', 'may', 'may', 'time', 'end', 'cherry', 'blossom', 'unite', 'state', 'mid', 'april', 'sakura', 'samurai', 'residence', 'tome', 'honest', 'greenery', 'cherry', 'blossom', 'scenery', 'feel', 'little', 'lonely', 'case', 'end', 'corona', 'judgment', 'carefully', 'watch', 'situation', 'sea', 'greenery', 'beautiful', 'fresh', 'green', 'season', 'gw', 'may', 'people']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True

I live in the Tokyo metropolitan area and sometimes drive in the Tohoku region, but if you are visiting the sea for sightseeing in Oshima, I think you should avoid it in winter.
There will be little snow in the plains.

If it's sunny, the monsoon is strong, and if it's cloudy, it's a landscape different from the bright image of the sea. It would be the worst if it rained even in the miso.

In winter, there is an advantage that inns and sightseeing spots are vacant, but when it comes to

268,8547,Ara- san,JP,Answer date: 2021-09-30,"Some things I noticed.

The best time to see the roses in Higashizawa Rose Garden is the end of September, so the
roses aren't blooming when you go.
For the time being, there is a lake and it is also called Higashizawa Park, so
you can go sightseeing as a park without roses.

The bus to Zao is late at 13:30.
The bus is probably the one used by the guests.
The ropeway is about once every 20 minutes, and it ends at 16:30 in November, and
it is dim and cold by that time.
The peak was around 17 degrees Celsius even in summer, so it
may be below 10 degrees Celsius in early November, and it gets quite cold when it gets dark at sunset.
If possible, it is desirable to depart by 12:00 at Yamagata Station.

Is this a round-trip ticket with a Zao ropeway ticket?
http://www.yamakobus.co.jp/new/20210619zaoset.html
There is a departure from Yamagata Station without going to Yamagata Airport.

If Zao also goes by bus around Yamagata, you
may not need a rental car?
You can walk to Higashizawa Park in Murayama with
JR, and you can also go to Yamadera, Tendo, and Kaminoyama Onsen by JR.

After all, it is convenient to have a rental car only in the Matsushima / Akiho area, so
it
may be enough to use the rental car for one day only on the third day (even one day is possible) .

Matsushima and Akiu also take time, but you can go by JR or bus.
I have never used Sendai Airport (JR only)
, but it seems that the high-speed train is faster than the car at Sendai Station.

Between Sendai over Yamagata, so go with the high-speed bus or Senzan Line,
1 day, out of the Airport to Sendai Station, up to Yamagata at JR or high-speed bus
to go,
that day in the tourist Yamagata, the second day a day full
Isn't it good for sightseeing in Zao ? I think.
Zao also depends on the weather, and if the weather is bad, I
wonder if I should stop the ropeway and use only hot springs in half a day.

Afternoon tea at The Westin Hotel was
good around Sendai Station .
I went there in 2010 when the hotel was built, but the
afternoon tea was on the 26th floor and the view was good.

The name of the afternoon tea shop has changed, and the
content is different from 2010, but now
it feels like Shine Muscat and the content have been upgraded.
Afternoon tea is 3880 yen (tax and service charge included) on weekdays.
If you make a WEB reservation from the website below, you will get 10% off at 3492 yen (tax and service charge included).
https://www.the-westin-sendai.com/rest/sym/sweet_sansation/ If you make a
reservation from the website, you can make a reservation with champagne or by the window (no 10% off).
There are options such as with parfait. In
addition, we recommend Zunda Mochi and Zunda Shake at Zunda Saryo in Sendai.
Sightseeing in Sendai city is rude, but there are few things to see, and half a day is enough.
Sendai Castle Ruins Park, Zuihoden, Osaki Hachimangu Shrine (shrine).

If I can take half a day on the last day, is that enough?
On the 4th day,
why not take the Shinkansen to Ichinoseki and go to Geibikei, Genbikei, and Hiraizumi ?
Rent-a-car is more convenient, but you can also go by bus.
I used the bus.

I don't know the means of transportation, but if you choose the lead hot springs and Osawa hot springs in Minami Hanamaki, which have the atmosphere of a hot spring resort, it will take a long time to get to Hanamaki station. There should be a free bus to the station.

Hanamaki Onsen is good as it is, but it is hard to throw away Dai Onsen, which is mainly a small inn in the back.

By the way, Hiraizumi, as many people have written it, I will avoid duplication, but I recommend Tatsuya Cave and Honederamura Ruins. Genbikei Gorge on the way is known for its valley beauty.


Ichinoseki is recommended for accommodation. It's worth staying just to visit the world-famous jazz cafe Basie, but the brewery restaurant Sekinoichi no Mochi cuisine is very famous, and the brewery is also a small museum.

The castle town of the Tamura clan was lost due to the flood, but when you look for it, some samurai residences remain and are open to the public.

The next morning, you can go to Geibikei on the Ofunato Line. Also, if you get off at Matsukawa, which is just before you, you will find a museum related to Kenji. This is because Kenji has worked as an engineer at the old crushed stone factory here.

272,8551,Brighton 's,JP,Answer date: 2021-03-28,"Hello, Mr.

Hammer Clavier, in December of last year, at the four temples of Michinoku's old temple pilgrimage ""Shiji Corridor"", Zuiganji Temple in Matsushima, which was opened by Jikaku Daishi Ennin, Risshakuji Temple in Yamadera, Chusonji Temple in Hiraizumi and Motsuji Temple. Then, I went to Miyagi, Yamagata, and Iwate for a four-night, five-day trip with the theme of following the back alley that Basho Matsuo visited.
In Iwate, I stayed at Hiraizumi and Ichinoseki, so I will write down various thoughts at that time for your reference.

First of all, Hiraizumi is a tour of historic sites and temples related to World Heritage Sites.
I think it is common to go around Motsuji Temple (Kanjizaiōin Ruins) -Hiraizumi Cultural Heritage Center-Chusonji Temple-Takadachi Gikeido-Mugenkouin Ruins.
Starting from JR Hiraizumi Station, it is about 7 to 8 kilometers, so you can walk around for a day.
According to the research at that time, I found that I could rent a car, rent a bicycle, or take a bus, but I decided to rent a car because I wanted to go to Geibikei, Genbikei, Takkoku Saikoji, and Ichinoseki's prestigious jazz cafe Basie.
If you can't drive, you can walk or rent a bicycle if you have enough physical strength, or if it's tight, you can go around the Hiraizumi patrol bus.
There is certainly a bicycle rental shop with electric assist in front of Hiraizumi station.
Runrun goes around all the above major spots, but please be careful about the operating days.
* For reference, http://iwatekenkotsu.co.jp/runrun_0419.html

Regarding accommodation, there are few inns and shops in Hiraizumi.
I used to stay at a hot spring inn in Hiraizumi for one night, but if you want to enjoy hot springs in Hanamaki, it might be better to go to Sendai or Ichinoseki.

Since the signs of the 4th wave of corona are seen in Miyagi prefecture, it is difficult to choose the time, but I think that you can have a fun trip with world heritage sites, hot springs, gourmet food!",When staying at Hanamaki and Hiraizumi for one night each.,forum,https://4travel.jp/traveler/u12751,4trip,travel,tourism,stb,JP,https://4travel.jp/dm_qa_each-76504.html,104890,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,300,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,134,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,134,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,134,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,134,0,0,0,0,134,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,300,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"['hello', 'mr', 'hammer', 'clavier', 'december', 'four', 'temples', 'michinokus', 'old', 'temple', 'pilgrimage', 'shiji', 'corridor', 'zuiganji', 'temple', 'matsushima', 'open', 'jikaku', 'daishi', 'ennin', 'risshakuji', 'temple', 'yamadera', 'chusonji', 'temple', 'hiraizumi', 'motsuji', 'temple', 'miyagi', 'yamagata', 'iwate', 'four', 'night', 'five', 'day', 'trip', 'theme', 'alley', 'basho', 'matsuo', 'visit', 'iwate', 'stay', 'hiraizumi', 'ichinoseki', 'write', 'various', 'thoughts', 'time', 'reference', 'hiraizumi', 'tour', 'historic', 'sit', 'temples', 'relate', 'world', 'heritage', 'sit', 'common', 'motsuji', 'temple', 'kanjizaiōin', 'ruin', 'hiraizumi', 'cultural', 'heritage', 'center', 'chusonji', 'temple', 'takadachi', 'gikeido', 'mugenkouin', 'ruin', 'start', 'jr', 'hiraizumi', 'station', '7', '8', 'kilometers', 'walk', 'day', 'accord', 'research', 'time', 'rent', 'car', 'rent', 'bicycle', 'bus', 'rent', 'car', 'geibikei', 'genbikei', 'takkoku', 'saikoji', 'ichinosekis', 'prestigious', 'jazz', 'cafe', 'basie', 'drive', 'walk', 'rent', 'bicycle', 'physical', 'strength', 'tight', 'hiraizumi', 'patrol', 'bus', 'bicycle', 'rental', 'shop', 'electric', 'assist', 'front', 'hiraizumi', 'station', 'runrun', 'major', 'spot', 'careful', 'operate', 'days', 'reference', 'http', 'iwatekenkotsucojp', 'runrun0419html', 'accommodation', 'inns', 'shop', 'hiraizumi', 'stay', 'hot', 'spring', 'inn', 'hiraizumi', 'one', 'night', 'hot', 'spring', 'hanamaki', 'sendai', 'ichinoseki', 'sign', '4th', 'wave', 'corona', 'see', 'miyagi', 'prefecture', 'difficult', 'time', 'fun', 'trip', 'world', 'heritage', 'sit', 'hot', 'spring', 'gourmet', 'food']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True

Whether to stay overnight in
Hiraizumi 1. Where to visit in Hiraizumi?
2. Whether or not to make a schedule after arriving in Sendai 3. The question is
what time to leave Hanamaki Onsen in connection with No. 1
.

In particular, Hiraizumi is famous for Chusonji Temple, but there are so many other attractions that it is important to choose whether to see it or not.

When I visited Hiraizumi in 2018, my primary purpose was to see all the remains of Iwate Prefecture, which is a World Heritage Site and is currently aiming to be added to the World Heritage Site, so it is contrary to Hammer Clavier's plan. I made Hanamaki a passing point, but the course is similar, so for reference below. (I will attach the URL of my travelogue. Please refer to it.) The

schedule is

Day 1 Tokyo Station → Tono Station → (Rentaka) → World Heritage Hashino blast furnace ruins → (Rentaka) → Tono Station → Ichinoseki Station → (Rentaka) → World Heritage Mogoshiji Temple → World Heritage Site of the Royal Palace Hiraizumi Tomari

Day 2 (All-day rental car) Hiraizumi Cultural Heritage Center → World Heritage Chusonji Temple → Shiratori Tate Ruins → Chojagahara Abandoned Temple Ruins → Honedera Village Shoen Ruins → Tatsuya Cave Bishamondo → Yanagi no Gosho Ruins → World Heritage Mugen Koin Ruins Hiraizumi Tomari

Day 3 World Heritage Kinkeizan Climbing → (Rentaka) → Takadachi Gikeido → (Rentaka) → Ichinoseki Station → Tokyo
https://4travel.jp/travelogue/11415549

I stayed at Hiraizumi for 2 nights. I rented a car because the assets I am aiming to register as a World Heritage Site are in the suburbs where buses are rarely running.
However, Chusonji Temple and Motsuji Temple are in the city and can be reached by bus, and I don't think it costs much by taxi.

If you plan to visit only Chusonji Temple in Hiraizumi, it takes just over 2 hours to visit Chusonji Temple, and it takes 30-40 minutes by bus or taxi from the station, so you don't have to stay in Hiraizumi. It's okay if you look at Motsuji Temple for an hour.

Hiraizumi is a tourist destination with many attractions, so the time required for Hiraizumi will change depending on what you see and what you don't see, and you will naturally decide whether or not to stay.
Hiraizumi also has Hiraizumi hot springs, and you can put them in the hot springs, so it might be good to squeeze the hot springs from Hanamaki hot springs!",When staying at Hanamaki and Hiraizumi for one night each.,forum,https://4travel.jp/traveler/dansan,4trip,travel,tourism,stb,JP,https://4travel.jp/dm_qa_each-76504.html,47500,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,200,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,200,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,50,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,50,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,50,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"['hello', 'hammer', 'clavier', 'name', 'passion', 'k', 'whether', 'stay', 'overnight', 'hiraizumi', '1', 'visit', 'hiraizumi', '2', 'whether', 'schedule', 'arrive', 'sendai', '3', 'question', 'time', 'hanamaki', 'onsen', 'connection', '1', 'particular', 'hiraizumi', 'famous', 'chusonji', 'temple', 'many', 'attractions', 'important', 'whether', 'see', 'visit', 'hiraizumi', '2018', 'primary', 'purpose', 'see', 'remain', 'iwate', 'prefecture', 'world', 'heritage', 'site', 'aim', 'add', 'world', 'heritage', 'site', 'contrary', 'hammer', 'claviers', 'plan', 'hanamaki', 'pass', 'point', 'course', 'similar', 'reference', 'attach', 'url', 'travelogue', 'refer', 'schedule', 'day', '1', 'tokyo', 'station', '→', 'tono', 'station', '→', 'rentaka', '→', 'world', 'heritage', 'hashino', 'blast', 'furnace', 'ruin', '→', 'rentaka', '→', 'tono', 'station', '→', 'ichinoseki', 'station', '→', 'rentaka', '→', 'world', 'heritage', 'mogoshiji', 'temple', '→', 'world', 'heritage', 'site', 'royal', 'palace', 'hiraizumi', 'tomari', 'https', '4traveljp', 'travelogue', '11415516', 'https', '4traveljp', 'travelogue', '11415529', 'day', '2', 'day', 'rental', 'car', 'hiraizumi', 'cultural', 'heritage', 'center', '→', 'world', 'heritage', 'chusonji', 'temple', '→', 'shiratori', 'tate', 'ruin', '→', 'chojagahara', 'abandon', 'temple', 'ruin', '→', 'honedera', 'village', 'shoen', 'ruin', '→', 'tatsuya', 'cave', 'bishamondo', '→', 'yanagi', 'gosho', 'ruin', '→', 'world', 'heritage', 'mugen', 'koin', 'ruin', 'hiraizumi', 'tomari', 'https', '4traveljp', 'travelogue', '11415533', 'https', '4traveljp', 'travelogue', '11415533', 'https', '4traveljp', 'travelogue', '11415546', 'day', '3', 'world', 'heritage', 'kinkeizan', 'climb', '→', 'rentaka', '→', 'takadachi', 'gikeido', '→', 'rentaka', '→', 'ichinoseki', 'station', '→', 'tokyo', 'https', '4traveljp', 'travelogue', '11415549', 'stay', 'hiraizumi', '2', 'nights', 'rent', 'car', 'assets', 'aim', 'register', 'world', 'heritage', 'site', 'suburbs', 'bus', 'rarely', 'run', 'chusonji', 'temple', 'motsuji', 'temple', 'city', 'reach', 'bus', 'cost', 'much', 'taxi', 'plan', 'visit', 'chusonji', 'temple', 'hiraizumi', '2', 'hours', 'visit', 'chusonji', 'temple', '30', '40', 'minutes', 'bus', 'taxi', 'station', 'stay', 'hiraizumi', 'motsuji', 'temple', 'hour', 'hiraizumi', 'tourist', 'destination', 'many', 'attractions', 'time', 'require', 'hiraizumi', 'see', 'see', 'naturally', 'whether', 'stay', 'hiraizumi', 'hiraizumi', 'hot', 'spring', 'hot', 'spring', 'good', 'squeeze', 'hot', 'spring', 'hanamaki', 'hot', 'spring']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True

there was a part that was a little confusing in my answer recently, so I will supplement it.

I wrote ""snow spikes"" only for ""human feet"" (laughs)
There are various names, but in winter you can see them at shoe stores and mountaineering equipment stores, most of which are made of rubber and can be worn on shoes. It's about 3000 yen.

The promenade of Yokotani Gorge is along the river, and there are places where it is frozen instead of snow, so I think it is dangerous to go normally.

The above is a supplement like a snake leg.

As you say, it's still cold ~
Nagano is in the ski season until the end of March, so there is a lot of snow at the ski resorts ...
At this time, it's a hot spring except for winter sports ~
(I'm sorry I'm not familiar with hot springs)

When I think of Tateshina, it's not just the ""Tateshinakogen Barakura English Garden""
roses. Christmas roses and bulbs are in bloom around March. The entrance fee is set cheaper than in the high season, and some days are free. For more information ↓

Tateshina Kogen Barakura English Garden ⇒ https://barakura.co.jp/about

Then there is a strange

""Tateshina Amusement Aquarium"" in the mountains with only freshwater fish ⇒ https://www.tateshina-aquarium. jp /

Also,

""Mishakaike"" drawn by Kaii Higashiyama ⇒ https://navi.chinotabi.jp/spot/3076/

I think that Mishakaike is beautiful in early summer and autumn leaves, but on a cold day There seems to be a day when you can see a beautiful white landscape. (Spots that are only recommended for private cars because of poor access)

If you come to Tateshina on the highway, you will probably get off at the ""Suwa Interchange"", but there is Suwa Taisha Shrine nearby. The lower shrine is on the opposite side of Lake Suwa, and there are four ""Suwa Taisha"" companies, so it may be good to go around all of them. (It's a power spot)

March in Shinshu is still cold, but when the weather is nice, the contrast between the clear blue sky and the pure white snowy mountains is the best (I personally think that the blue sky in early spring is the most beautiful). But I think you can enjoy it.

Mr. Mita does not say, ""A surveillance camera is attached to all ICs in Nagano prefecture to monitor other prefecture numbers""! Do you monitor and turn back?
Most ICs nationwide are equipped with surveillance cameras (to see traffic conditions, etc.)!

Certainly, when I went to ""Barakura"" on Prefectural Day last fall, there were many foreign cars (Kanto) in Tateshinakogen, probably because there are many villas, even though I was warned about moving across prefectures. It was. (Same for Karuizawa)
Sometimes infected people come out from this villa family (counted in Nagano and hospitalization is also Nagano), and even though children in Nagano such as university students who are going to the metropolitan area can not go home, from outside the prefecture Some harsh opinions are heard when there are people who can come.
However, since it is a tourist prefecture, there are many places waiting for tourists to take measures against infection. Please go out when the state of emergency is lifted.

I don't think the trip will be the same as before even if vaccination starts, but let's enjoy it as it is!

283,8826,Mita Meguro Let 's,JP,Answer date: 2021-02-25,"Hello Mii-san.

I'm curious about the expression ""Tateshina"", but in the so-called Tateshina, an area with an orthodox meaning (?) Between Routes 192 and 299, ""One night and two days in mid-March, ski snowboarding. If the condition is ""I won't do it"", I don't think there are many places to go sightseeing, so I think it's better to stay in a hot spring or a hotel with delicious food.

When it comes to Suwa, it's better to aim for Suwa from the beginning, and if it's about Lake Suwa, it won't take much via Route 152, but what about March? I don't know how many shops (especially where to eat) will be back in the middle of March, but a hotel with hot springs and meals (a nice place where everything is completed in the hall) may be better now. I don't know.

In addition, I have been to and from Nagano several times in the past year due to various circumstances, but although it may be different from the place where there are many tourists originally, the ordinary places of Nanshin and Hokushin ( In that case, both of them are very concerned about people from other prefectures, and I saw three times the poster saying ""Please refrain from customers from outside the prefecture."" (I've heard that there was a talk about attaching surveillance cameras to all ICs in Nagano prefecture to monitor other prefecture numbers. I don't know if it's a lie ...) The state of emergency has been lifted. Even if you go from the area where it was done, you should move a little carefully (?). (My personal impression ...)

mid-March, it's still winter in the area.
Be sure to protect yourself from the cold.
Is ... to be considered in the sights of this period

and North Yatsugatake ropeway

is good car window of the landscape. You can see the Yatsugatake mountain range and Mt. Ontake from a distance.
It might be a good idea to walk ""Tsuboba"" from the mountaintop station. It's just a perfect snowy road, so it's safer to have something like snow spikes. A short walk will bring you to a mountain lodge (Shimagare Sansou) with a blue triangular roof, where you can take a break with a hot drink. The scenery from this area is also very beautiful.

・ Megami

Lake It is a small lake that freezes completely in the middle of winter, but the scenery with the mountains in the background is beautiful. On weekdays, the shop may be closed. If that happens, I will die (laughs)

・ Lake Tateshina

Like Megami Lake, it is a very small lake (pond). There is no such thing as this in winter, but it seems that the roadside station opened last summer. It might be a good idea to stop by after a break.

・ Yokotani Gorge The

road surface may still be frozen in March, so snow spikes are essential.
There are few people on the promenade along the river, and you can see stunning icicles on the opposite bank (although the timing is terrible). At the entrance of Yokotanikyo, ""Maiden Falls"" has frozen droplets, and you can see the scenery unique to winter. If you can walk to Yokotani Kannon, the view from there is quite spectacular.

・ Sekiseki Ruins Jomon Archaeological Museum The

area is close to Chino City, but it doesn't seem to be very popular (laughs).

・ Tateshina Free Farm

This is also a direct sales office like a roadside station in an area near Chino city. There are a wide variety of products and processed products, so it is a facility that can be used for home use and as souvenirs.

As mentioned above, I'm sorry for the old information, but I hope it helps.
In addition, my actual experience was before the Corona disaster, so the situation may have changed now. note that.

Perhaps it is better to go to sightseeing spots around Suwa than Tateshina.

・ Kirigamine (Kurumayama Plateau) hiking

<Shirakaba Lake>
・ Shadow picture of the world ・ Kirie ・ Glass ・Music Box Museum

There is no place like a tourist spot on the forest road in the back from Hotaka Onsen, and I remember that I was just concerned about driving on bad roads.
I think it's a trip by car, so please be careful as it may be after heavy rain.

I don't really understand the part that says, ""On the way back from Azumino, Matsumoto, Suwa, Kiso, and Kaida Kogen.""
Nakabusa Onsen is at the back of a clogged road, and if you don't come back near Hotaka Station, there is no way back.

This summer has a lot of bad weather, so don't decide to go sightseeing the next day. We recommend that you plan flexibly, such as ""Azumino Sightseeing Daio Wasabi Farm (reference URL)"".

Only when the weather is nice, instead of ""Kaida Kogen passing through Kiso"", avoid going through Matsumoto and Shiojiri, which are likely to be crowded on holidays. It seems that there is no way to cross the Nomugi Pass, which is famous for Watari, Prefectural Roads 26 and 39, and enter Kaida Kogen on National Road 361. (It is also good to go from Nagano Pass in the north of Kaida Kogen to Gero via Nigorigo Onsen.) It

It's difficult to predict because it seems to be blooming today,
but if the weather isn't bad, the best time to see it is around the 6th.
However, probably because of the high temperature this year, it is difficult because there are many places in the northeastern part of Kanto and around Fukushima where it is early to bloom after flowering.

area around Tateyama Murodo after mid - September is crowded every year during the autumn foliage season.
It's a general view because I don't know the itinerary.
Next year, there may be some hope for infectious diseases.
On weekends and holidays, both parking lots and vehicles are very crowded every year, so choosing a weekday is the correct answer. → It is a real experience.
Even so, we recommend staying around Murodo or near Kurobe Dam, but it is important to make a reservation quite early because there are few facilities.
In September, typhoons are also a concern, and sudden changes in the weather, especially around Tateyama, will immediately affect ropeways and plateau buses.
Make a plan with plenty of time.
It is necessary to check the weather frequently in advance and be prepared to always make ""cancellation"" an option in some cases.
You can see the congestion status on the web, so it's a good idea to try it this season.
Looking back at my photos, I think that the weather is the life of going to the ""Kurobe Tateyama Alpine Route"".
Then please be careful next year!

I don't know the time to return, but using the first flight from Haneda and the last flight at Noto Airport, one night and two days was enough.

I couldn't go sightseeing due to the sea conditions, but there is a tourist spot called ""Power Hall"" near Lamp no Yado. Since we are going by a small boat, the flight will be canceled if the sea is a little rough. It was canceled even though it was sunny when I went. Even if it is OK in the morning, it may be NG in the afternoon, so if you want to see the power hole without fail, call immediately after arriving, check if the ship is moving, and if you can get on the ship, board on that day, If the flight is canceled, I think it is better to try again the next day.

As you can see, the Ichibata Electric Railway was closed due to typhoon No. 9 after the previous lesson, so it will be back by the 25th ... Shimane Prefecture is likely to get off from yesterday to the weekend. ... It's a little difficult.

If it has already been decided, I have nothing to say, but whether it is Matsue Shinjiko Onsen or Tamatsukuri Onsen, you have to go to JR Matsue Station (rental car is rented, right?) Because neither rental car nor JR will start. I don't think that ""convenience of transportation"" does not affect Yuki-san's schedule so much. Matsue Shinjiko Onsen is a hot spring that was dug up after the war like Ishiwa Onsen in the Kanto area, and compared to Tamatsukuri Onsen as a hot spring, but the scenery of Lake Shinji is probably the best. It should be, and sightseeing in Matsue city can be started on foot, so please enjoy it including meals. For reference, I will link a list of buses with Matsue Station.
https://www.ichibata.co.jp/railway/operate/transit.html

There is already a lesson, but there may be heavy traffic near Izumo Taisha. I have been involved when going from Izumo Taisha to Izumo City Station by bus. (I wrote in the previous lesson that I would take a bus from Izumo City Station to Izumo Taisha Shrine, but I forgot to mention that there is an Ichibata train. If you're traveling by car (I don't know about it these days), you should have plenty of time.

Also, it seems that there is not much merit of a car between Matsue and Izumo (even if the Ichibata train stops ... unless you go to Ichibata Yakushi or an aquarium on the way). If you're going to Cape Hino, I think there's room for consideration by taking a taxi from Izumo Taisha (it seems that there are some ordinary taxis, sightseeing taxis, etc.). (I think Inasa Beach can be walked from Izumo Taisha Shrine.) In any case, if the Ichibata train stops, there may be various effects, so it is better to consult with the local hotel and decide. It may be good.

Also, ""Atones Izumo"", which looks like the station building of Izumo City Station, has a fair amount of items including souvenirs, so I think you should buy it here and board the sunrise.

As an aside, if you like airplanes, rather than just Okayama Airport (?) In the mountains, you can pass over Lake Shishido (I'm sure it's always the case).

354,11860,Mita Meguro Let 's,JP,Answer date: 2021-08-09,"Hello Yuki-san.

Regarding the round trip, I don't recommend going to Okayama by plane just to see Okayama (city). (There is nothing to see (?). Except for castles, Japan and the world's three major 〇〇, etc.) Due to the ticket for the return, all lines are JR, going from Shinkansen to Okayama I think it is possible to go via the Hakubi line. Without it, it would be better to fly from Haneda to Izumo Airport on the first day and go straight to Tamatsukuri Onsen to relax.

Since I was asked about the time of Tamatsukuri Onsen → Izumo Taisha, I will write below on the assumption that I will use public transportation instead of renting a car. ・ ・ ・
Https://www.ichibata.co.jp/t-izumo/shuttle/docs/taisya_20210601-20210831_0524.pdf
Airport → Tamatsukuri Onsen has one direct bus per day, so it's not very realistic.

Izumo Airport is Lake Shinji in Matsue City Since it is just on the opposite bank across the road, I think it would be better to run the port for Matsue, but for the time being, it would be realistic to go out to Matsue and return to Tamatsukuri Onsen.

https://www.ichibata.co.jp/bus/rosen/pdf/time_tamayu_0.pdf
Tamatsukuri Onsen → Tamatsukuri Onsen Station → Matsue bus time is like this. You can go by bus to Matsue as it is, and transfer to JR at Tamatsukurionsen Station in the direction of Izumo (I'll dictate, but it may be better to go via Matsue), but I don't think there will be any inconvenience at this frequency. increase.

Also, regarding accommodation, if you divide it into two nights and one night, you may stay at Matsue Shinjiko Onsen for one night, but if you stay for three nights, Tamatsukuri Onsen is good. As a hot spring town, it is fairly solid, has an atmosphere, and as mentioned above, it is not a very inconvenient place.

For sightseeing, I think it's a good idea to plan separately for the Matsue side and the Izumo side. The Matsue side is already out of the castle and the city, but I think it would be better to go to the Adachi Museum of Art (shuttle bus from JR Yasugi Station).
https://www.adachi-museum.or.jp/

What kind of direction (?) Is Lake Shinji interested in? If it is a pleasure boat, I think it is better to match it with the ""Matsue side"".
http://hakuchougo.jp/
If it's the setting sun, I like it from the window of the Ichibata train, but there are spots in Matsue city, so please check it out.

About Izumo Taisha, there is a bus from JR Izumo City Station, but I think it is easier to understand if you go to Matsue Shinjiko Onsen and go by Ichibata train.
https://www.ichibata.co.jp/railway/docs/timetable20170401.pdf#zoom=100&view=Fit&pagemode=bookmarks
Is it about 2 hours one way together with the above bus? JR Tamatsukurionsen Station → JR Izumo City Station → Bus may be earlier if the time is right, but please study there. Also, although this has already been mentioned, it is recommended to go to Cape Hino on the Izumo side.

(It's about 20 minutes by bus from Izumo Taisha Shrine, but the bus service isn't very good, so I hope it fits well.) A

Matsue Shishidoko Onsen is a good hot spring for sightseeing in Matsue and Izumo. There are many hotels with a view of Lake Shinji, and you can easily go from Shishidoko Onsen Station to Izumo Taisha by Ichibata Electric Railway, or just change once.
Matsue Castle is also within walking distance.
The disadvantage is that you have to travel about 10 minutes by bus from Matsue Station, but there are many.
Also, Tamatsukurionsen Station is a local station, and it takes 5 to 6 minutes by taxi to reach the hot springs, which is suitable for cars and group trips, not for individuals using public transportation.

Even if you exclude Okayama City on the first day, you can enjoy Izumo if you stay for 3 nights.

Tamatsukuri Onsen is a quiet hot spring resort, but if you are a student, I think that it is easier to go out and enjoy eating out if you stay at Shinjiko Onsen for three consecutive nights in Matsue City.
(Even if the menu changes, the same inn's dinner lasts for 3 days)

I think the problem is the foot of sightseeing on the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th.

It is convenient to have a rental car, but other than Matsue city, it is an inconvenient tourist destination only by public transportation.

For example, on the second day, take a regular sightseeing bus (reference URL) and go around with a guide. It is also possible to stay at Tamatsukuri Onsen.


The third day, Adachi Museum of Art direction to go by public transport
(if Matsue Uchidomari, return, day bathing also one idea in Tamatsukuri Onsen)

3 day, rented a tourist taxi, luggage also gained, Day 2 Guided around places that could not be reached by regular sightseeing bus. (If you are greedy, you can

also go sightseeing in Iwami Ginzan.) If you want to visit Izumo Taisha slowly, you can stop by again or go to Cape Hino.
(If you are staying in Matsue city, you can take the Ichibata train to Izumo Taisha and take a sightseeing taxi.)

Finally, have them arrive at Izumo city station, eat the famous soba, and board the Sunrise Izumo.

Isn't it okay to take the Shinkansen to Okayama Station on the outbound route? Receive transfer discounts, round-trip discounts, etc.

It's a recommended sightseeing spot, but
where did you decide to travel to Hiroshima in the first place ?
Whether or not you have a
rental car depends on where you want to go, but if you plan to rent a car,
try renting it on the second day, when you have the most time.
The Shinkansen boarding is waiting for you on the third day
, so I think it's a good idea to go sightseeing in Hiroshima city.

The wind may still be a little cold, but when it's sunny,
drive or cycle on the Shimanami Kaido, and go sightseeing in Tomonoura.

Okunoshima, a rabbit island that doubles as somewhere.

On the other hand,
if you go to the Otorii of Itsukushima Shrine, which is rarely seen, it will be Yamaguchi, but you can
go there because there is Kintaikyo Bridge.

It's 2 nights and 3 days, so I don't think I can go here and there too much.",About sightseeing in Hiroshima,forum,https://4travel.jp/traveler/taino-okashira,4trip,travel,tourism,stb,JP,https://4travel.jp/dm_qa_each-76437.html,25000,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,50,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,50,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,200,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"['hello', 'recommend', 'sightsee', 'spot', 'travel', 'hiroshima', 'place', 'whether', 'rental', 'car', 'plan', 'rent', 'car', 'try', 'rent', 'second', 'day', 'time', 'shinkansen', 'board', 'wait', 'third', 'day', 'good', 'idea', 'sightsee', 'hiroshima', 'city', 'wind', 'may', 'little', 'cold', 'sunny', 'drive', 'cycle', 'shimanami', 'kaido', 'sightsee', 'tomonoura', 'okunoshima', 'rabbit', 'island', 'double', 'hand', 'otorii', 'itsukushima', 'shrine', 'rarely', 'see', 'yamaguchi', 'kintaikyo', 'bridge', '2', 'nights', '3', 'days', 'much']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True

, unless you enter from Hiroshima Airport by plane or travel by about 4 people on the Shinkansen, train (JR. Sanyo Main Line, I think Kure Line, Hiroshima Electric Railway (city line / Miyajima Line), buses, ships, etc. are easier to move and cheaper.

Unless you are an elderly person and are not good at walking, or if you do not always want to sit in the car, I think that you can enjoy a trip with changes such as traveling by boat without a car.

If you stay at the Hiroshima Washington Hotel, you can walk to the Peace Memorial Park / Atomic Bomb Dome, Hiroshima Castle, Shukkeien, and the Prefectural Museum of Art, as they are located in Hatchobori, the center of the city.
It is also close to the bus center where buses to the suburbs leave, making it easy to sit down and use from the starting point (even if it takes a little longer than a car).
If you are in a hurry, some may move by taxi.

In mid-March, I would recommend Shukkeien in the daimyo garden or the Seto Inland Sea.
I think Miyajima's Otorii is under renovation work, but if you haven't been to Miyajima, you should definitely visit it slowly in China and Japan.

427,13597,Wanderer 's,JP,Answer date: 2021-01-28,"There seems to be a lot of advice, but if you are a student, you will probably go on a long drive trip with one rental car.

The first reason is that traveling by car has the advantage of having a great deal of freedom in time and destination, but it is not possible to read the exact time required.
If only the inn is decided and dinner is not included, it doesn't matter whether you arrive at 20:00 or 22:00 (as long as you contact us).
Even if it is a car main, if there is a regular bus or surface mail in the middle of the process (if you miss it, the process will be hindered), you need to return the rental car with plenty of time, which is a big restriction. There are many transfer locations where traffic is congested.

The second reason is that the Shimanami Kaido is more enjoyable to cross by car than to pass by bus because you can get closer to the island on the way.

The third reason is that the same rental car has less driving risk and stress.
If you drive various cars on a regular basis, the stress may be small, but I am not good at changing lever operations and navigation operations.
(If you specify the vehicle type, you may be able to make the two vehicles the same, but it will be higher than the vehicle type designation pear.) Although it is a

weather, unless a typhoon comes, ferries and high-speed boats in the Seto Inland Sea can be canceled. I think the sex is small. However, if you encounter thick fog, there will be significant delays and associated inconveniences. (If you arrive in Matsuyama in the evening, the probability of encountering thick fog is low.)

If you cross the Seto Inland Sea to Matsuyama City by boat, you can go sightseeing in the city and Dogo Onsen without a rental car. If you don't have to look for a parking lot or get back there, you may be able to move faster, and some may take a taxi.
There are many limited express buses between Matsuyama and Kochi, so if you rent a bus near Kochi Station and return it at Kochi Airport, it will be cheaper than renting in Ehime Prefecture.",Transportation from Hiroshima to Ehime,forum,https://4travel.jp/traveler/kt1000,4trip,travel,tourism,stb,JP,https://4travel.jp/dm_qa_each-76431.html,60800,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,500,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,180,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"['lot', 'advice', 'student', 'long', 'drive', 'trip', 'one', 'rental', 'car', 'reason', 'travel', 'car', 'advantage', 'deal', 'freedom', 'time', 'destination', 'read', 'exact', 'time', 'require', 'inn', 'dinner', 'include', 'matter', 'whether', 'arrive', '2000', '2200', 'long', 'contact', 'car', 'main', 'regular', 'bus', 'surface', 'mail', 'middle', 'process', 'miss', 'process', 'hinder', 'rental', 'car', 'plenty', 'time', 'big', 'restriction', 'many', 'transfer', 'locations', 'traffic', 'congest', 'second', 'reason', 'shimanami', 'kaido', 'enjoyable', 'cross', 'car', 'pass', 'bus', 'closer', 'island', 'way', 'third', 'reason', 'rental', 'car', 'less', 'drive', 'risk', 'stress', 'drive', 'various', 'cars', 'regular', 'basis', 'stress', 'may', 'small', 'good', 'lever', 'operations', 'navigation', 'operations', 'specify', 'vehicle', 'type', 'may', 'able', 'two', 'vehicles', 'higher', 'vehicle', 'type', 'designation', 'pear', 'weather', 'typhoon', 'ferry', 'high', 'speed', 'boat', 'seto', 'inland', 'sea', 'cancel', 'sex', 'small', 'encounter', 'thick', 'fog', 'significant', 'delay', 'associate', 'inconvenience', 'arrive', 'matsuyama', 'probability', 'encounter', 'thick', 'fog', 'low', 'cross', 'seto', 'inland', 'sea', 'matsuyama', 'city', 'boat', 'sightsee', 'city', 'dogo', 'onsen', 'rental', 'car', 'park', 'lot', 'may', 'able', 'move', 'faster', 'may', 'taxi', 'many', 'limit', 'express', 'bus', 'matsuyama', 'kochi', 'rent', 'bus', 'near', 'kochi', 'station', 'kochi', 'airport', 'cheaper', 'rent', 'ehime', 'prefecture']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True
429,13599,Mahina 's,JP,Answer date: 2021-01-28,"Good evening again.

It seems that ferry movement is also being considered.

The defense ferry is a car ferry and the hull is still large, so I
wonder if it will shake that much.

My friend is in Amakusa, Kumamoto, and it's surrounded by the sea, so I have a lot more
chances to board any ferry.
To get to Nagasaki on the north side and Kagoshima on the south side, you have to go around by car, so it
takes time, so it operates as a national highway ferry.
When I go to Kagoshima on a petite trip from Amakusa, I
sometimes use a ferry that crosses the Satsuma Peninsula and the Osumi Peninsula.

In my case, I didn't put the car on the car ferry at first, so I was a
little excited, but
gradually the ferry became a break time for the driver (laughs)

That Setouchi. I don't know how the waves and tides flow
around, but I think it will run unless it's rough, but
it's best to ask the defense ferry about that.
(How bad the weather is, it often

cancels) I have canceled the flight because of the rough waves from Nagasaki to Amakusa once due to strong winds.
I had sailed up to one flight before, so
I was able to cross it if I was in time for that sailing in front of me . .. ..

There is a ferry other than bad weather, or there is a dock up
It will be suspended due to inspection. It is up to
the ferry company to suspend or make a temporary timetable . I don't know when you're traveling, so you can check the
website, but the defense ferry is a temporary timetable during that time
, so it's not suspended.

Looking at the map, it seems that each port is close to the station, but
Ehime's Mitsuhama port is a short walk to Mitsu station, isn't it? .. ..
Other than taxi or bus, Orix Rent-A-Car Matsuyama store seems to
have a free transfer to Mitsuihama Port, so if you want to use the car immediately after that, you can use that
.

However, when returning a rental car in Yamaguchi Prefecture, even if you return the rental car in
front of Iwakuni Station after sightseeing in Kintaikyo Bridge,
it will not be picked up because there is a distance to Yanai Port .
It takes about 30 minutes to travel from Iwakuni to Yanaiminato Station by train, but the number is small.
If so, it will take about an hour, but
I think it's better to go to Hiroshima Station, which has a few more lines.

I wrote this incoherently, but in my personal opinion
, if it is a move with a car, the ferry is convenient, so there is an option,
but if it is only human beings, it will eventually reach the port. There is a reed.
In the first place, you are
thinking about returning a rental car in Hiroshima and having few transfers, so I think the bus you originally thought was better.

I plan to write it in the answer, and if you do a quick search, it will take a little over 4 hours to drive.
There are also time for procedures, sightseeing time, meals, simple breaks, etc., so
the bus movement on the evening of arrival

I often drop off my rental car, so it will be expensive if you cross more than two prefectures.

If the ferry isn't an option, the shortest by land is the bus.

Sightseeing from Yamaguchi Airport and returning the rental car at Fukuyama Station in Hiroshima Prefecture Take the
Shimanami Liner to Imabari Station
Rent a car at
Imabari Station to Matsuyama Imabari Station will be in Ehime Prefecture, so you don't have to rent a car at Matsuyama mosquito?

I am in Osaka, but most of Shikoku and the Chugoku region travel by private car.

I think you will be traveling on the Shimanami Kaido by bus this time, but if you haven't traveled yet, we recommend stopping by an island on the way from Shikoku to Honshu and from Honshu to Shikoku.

Also, if the weather is nice when going from Ehime prefecture to Kochi prefecture, it may be good to drive Shikoku Karst and cross the prefecture.

The answer may have been a little late.
As for Tsunoshima, I stayed at Tawarayama Onsen. There was a taste in the hot springs. In Nagato City, I liked Motonosumi Shrine, Kaneko Misuzu Memorial Museum, and Qingdao.

It's near Akiyoshido, but I also like Yuda Onsen.

If location + Tsunoshima view is prioritized, ""Hotel Nishi-Nagato Resort"" will be your choice. If all rooms have ocean views and are on the right half of

The bath is a simple hot spring, but it is a hot spring, and you can see Tsunoshima from the open-air bath.

Although it is in category (3), one point is missing from your answers.

He said he was going out for the first week of June. It's about time for the rainy season. The seasons are fast this year, so it may be raining.

Koyasan in the rain is also nice, but please be prepared for your feet. I think it's a good idea to have shoes that are resistant to rain, slippery, and dirty.
You will have to walk a reasonable distance to Okunoin, and there are many bumps on the paving stones, making it slippery. Due to the terrain, Koyasan is prone to heavy rain, so if you have a good rain forecast, it is safe to change your socks and stockings.

On the contrary, be careful of the temperature rise when it is sunny. There are many shades of trees, but it is a place with high humidity, so it is necessary to prepare for heat stroke. We recommend that you carry a hat, parasol and drinks.

If you have a relaxed attitude, you will be able to get away from the world and feel the atmosphere of the sacred place more, without turning around like a normal tourist spot.

You go to Nara during the cherry blossom season!
Sounds good! !!

There are other famous places such as Koriyama Castle, Takadagawa, Matabei Sakura, etc., but I will answer about the places I have been to.

①
Along the Saho River ... Cherry blossoms are planted for many kilometers. I think it is convenient to access because it is close to the center of Nara.

Mt. Mimuro ... It's in Ikaruga, and it's about the size of a hill rather than a mountain, but it was wonderful because the entire mountain was covered with cherry blossoms. Cherry blossoms were also planted along the Tatsuta River until I got there, and it was fun to walk because the locals had a small banquet with their neighbors.
It's not flashy at all, but I liked the laid-back atmosphere of Nara.

②
Hasedera ... Needless to say, it is a flower temple.

Himuro Shrine ... The weeping cherry blossoms are amazing right next to Nara Park, but when I visited there a few years ago, I was lonely because the cherry blossoms got sick. I'm not sure about the situation this year, so I would appreciate it if you could check in advance.
It is a convenient place to see the cherry blossoms around Todaiji Temple, Nara Park, and Ukimido.

Oomiwa Shrine ... Weeping cherry blossoms are also beautiful here, so if you like weeping cherry blossoms, we recommend it.

Ishibutai Tumulus ... I like the laid-back scenery of the stone stage and Asuka and the cherry blossoms.

Chogosonshiji Temple ... You can see the cherry blossoms from a high place and it wasn't crowded when I went, so it might be good if you want to relax.

③ The best time to see the cherry blossoms in Yoshino is slightly different, such as upper thousand, middle thousand, and lower thousand, but I think it is still a little early at the end of March. It depends on changes in temperature, so you may see it if it blooms earlier than usual.

It would be nice if the weather was nice and you could see the beautiful cherry blossoms!",If you want to see cherry blossoms in Nara !?,forum,https://4travel.jp/traveler/kaka_chan,4trip,travel,tourism,stb,JP,https://4travel.jp/dm_qa_each-76464.html,10000,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,100,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"['hebio', 'san', 'nara', 'cherry', 'blossom', 'season', 'sound', 'good', 'famous', 'place', 'koriyama', 'castle', 'takadagawa', 'matabei', 'sakura', 'place', '①', 'saho', 'river', 'cherry', 'blossom', 'plant', 'many', 'kilometers', 'convenient', 'access', 'close', 'center', 'nara', 'mt', 'mimuro', 'ikaruga', 'size', 'hill', 'mountain', 'wonderful', 'entire', 'mountain', 'cover', 'cherry', 'blossom', 'cherry', 'blossom', 'plant', 'tatsuta', 'river', 'fun', 'walk', 'locals', 'small', 'banquet', 'neighbor', 'flashy', 'lay', 'atmosphere', 'nara', '②', 'hasedera', 'needle', 'flower', 'temple', 'himuro', 'shrine', 'weep', 'cherry', 'blossom', 'amaze', 'right', 'nara', 'park', 'visit', 'lonely', 'cherry', 'blossom', 'sick', 'situation', 'advance', 'convenient', 'place', 'see', 'cherry', 'blossom', 'todaiji', 'temple', 'nara', 'park', 'ukimido', 'oomiwa', 'shrine', 'weep', 'cherry', 'blossom', 'beautiful', 'weep', 'cherry', 'blossom', 'recommend', 'ishibutai', 'tumulus', 'lay', 'scenery', 'stone', 'stage', 'asuka', 'cherry', 'blossom', 'chogosonshiji', 'temple', 'see', 'cherry', 'blossom', 'high', 'place', 'wasnt', 'crowd', 'good', 'relax', '③', 'time', 'see', 'cherry', 'blossom', 'yoshino', 'slightly', 'different', 'upper', 'thousand', 'middle', 'thousand', 'lower', 'thousand', 'little', 'early', 'end', 'march', 'temperature', 'may', 'see', 'bloom', 'earlier', 'usual', 'weather', 'see', 'beautiful', 'cherry', 'blossom']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True

How about Shirahama?
It is a standard travel destination for Kansai people.
From Wakayama station, it takes 1 hour and 15 minutes by JR.

There are many attractions such as Sandanbeki Rock and Engetsu Island, and
when I was a kid, I used to ride a glass-bottom boat.
There are pandas and other animals in Adventure World.
There are also buses to move around the park.

There are hot springs in Shirahama, and there are also hot spring inns.

We recommend Toretore Market, a market with a restaurant centered on seafood.

I went there in winter, but here is a travel report.
I
haven't been to Engetsu Island or Sandanbeki because the weather was bad and I had already been there at another time .

Neither place is convenient for rail transportation, and bus service is essential, and since
it is a mountainous area, it is necessary to check the weather forecast immediately before, with snow in winter and heavy rain during typhoons.
However, I think you can enjoy a quiet time with less crowds.

My favorite hot spring is the cave hot spring of Katsuura Onsen. It was destroyed by a typhoon at one point and I don't know if it is still open.
The atmosphere was good at Dorogawa Onsen. It retains the atmosphere of an old-fashioned Yamabushi accommodation.

518,17325,Acorn Don,JP,Answer date: 2021/06/18,"Hello.
I'm always on a poor trip, so I don't know if it will be helpful, but I've been doing it many times, so I'll answer.
Wakayama is a good place, so please enjoy it! The

order is Shirahama → Kushimoto → Katsuura → Hongu (Yu no Mine).
● For Shirahama Onsen ① Saki-no-Yu (the sea and the hot spring are connected) ② Tsuna-no-Yu (It is a public bath, but the quality of the hot spring is excellent) For
sightseeing ① Sandanbeki ② Senjojiki ③ Engetsu Island?
If you are staying at a hotel, you should search the internet for an inn where you can eat que (fish) and stay there.
● There is Kushimoto Onsen, but we do not recommend it.
For sightseeing, (1) Hashiguiiwa (2) Shionomisaki Lighthouse (3) Muryoji (Maruyama Okyo, Nagasawa Rosetsu's bran picture is worth seeing.)
If you are staying at the former Kushimoto Royal Hotel, you should remove it for 3 nights and 4 days.
● Katsuura Onsen is a day trip, but there are many very good hot springs. All are flowing from the source. (1) Nassayama Onsen (excellent) (2) Kiyomonyu (3) Yuriyama Onsen and many recommendations.
For sightseeing, Nachi Taisha (the god is Nachi Falls) Nachi Taisha is said to be Kumano Sanzan, and there are three mountains at Shingu's Hayatama Taisha and Hongu's Hongu Taisha.
If you are staying at a hotel, my recommendation is ""Umi no Hotel Ichinotaki"", but it is an old hotel that has nothing but hot springs, but the hot springs are the best hot springs that flow directly from the source. Meals are not included. If you go to Katsuura, please eat tuna.
There are many delicious shops around Katsuura Station. My recommendation is to make a reservation for both ""Hiro 𠮷"" and ""One wheel"" for dinner. For lunch, we recommend ""Takehara"". If you would like to dine at the hotel, Manseiro is the place to go.
There are ""Hotel Urashima"" and ""Nakanoshima"" (the hot springs are circulating, but the scenery is nice), but if you stay in Katsuura, you can hang around in front of Katsuura station and have a footbath. We recommend that you have tuna at.
● I would like you to stay overnight at the main shrine (Yu no Mine) hot spring. Since it is in the mountains, there is no place to go outside to eat.
My regular inn is ""Minshuku Yamane"" (8,000 yen with half board), but the toilet is shared and old, but the hot spring is the same source as the hot spring. There is also an old-fashioned ""Ryokan Azumaya"", so if you are new to Azumaya, you should go for it.
Speaking of sightseeing, please come in at Tsuboyu. How about making hot spring eggs? If you want to visit, it's
Hongu Taisha. It is also a good idea to walk along the Kumano Kodo from Prince Shinshinmon to the main shrine.

1 night in Shirahama → 1 night in Katsuura → 1 night in Hongu (Yu no Mine) is recommended.
I have listed the recommendations without permission, but public transportation is very vulnerable. That is another good point. There is little traffic and we recommend renting a car for about 3 days from Shirahama Station. The traffic is light and the roads are wide except for Yunomine Onsen.

By train, it
takes about two and a half hours from Shin-Osaka to Shirahama by limited express Kuroshio.
If you want to take a reserved seat at this time, we recommend the seat on the left side when you return from the seat on the right side in the direction of travel.
The car body shakes quite a bit, but the view from the car window is the best.

Shin-Osaka Station → Shirahama Station (Shirahama sightseeing is by bus or taxi) Shirahama Station or Kise Line train movement → Katsuura Station (bus OR taxi such as Nachi) Katsuura Station to Shingu Station (train movement) From Shingu to Hongu is a bus movement. Please note that the number is small! It takes about an hour and a half.",About Shirahama / Katsuura / Enjoyment Plan,forum,https://4travel.jp/traveler/bihedan,4trip,travel,tourism,stb,JP,https://4travel.jp/dm_shisetsu/10031354/qa/76595,234300,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1000,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,490,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1000,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"['hello', 'poor', 'trip', 'helpful', 'many', 'time', 'ill', 'wakayama', 'good', 'place', 'order', 'shirahama', '→', 'kushimoto', '→', 'katsuura', '→', 'hongu', 'yu', '●', 'shirahama', 'onsen', '①', 'saki', 'yu', 'sea', 'hot', 'spring', 'connect', '②', 'tsuna', 'yu', 'public', 'bath', 'quality', 'hot', 'spring', 'excellent', 'sightsee', '①', 'sandanbeki', '②', 'senjojiki', '③', 'engetsu', 'island', 'stay', 'hotel', 'search', 'internet', 'inn', 'eat', 'que', 'fish', 'stay', '●', 'kushimoto', 'onsen', 'recommend', 'sightsee', '1', 'hashiguiiwa', '2', 'shionomisaki', 'lighthouse', '3', 'muryoji', 'maruyama', 'okyo', 'nagasawa', 'rosetsus', 'bran', 'picture', 'worth', 'see', 'stay', 'former', 'kushimoto', 'royal', 'hotel', 'remove', '3', 'nights', '4', 'days', '●', 'katsuura', 'onsen', 'day', 'trip', 'many', 'good', 'hot', 'spring', 'flow', 'source', '1', 'nassayama', 'onsen', 'excellent', '2', 'kiyomonyu', '3', 'yuriyama', 'onsen', 'many', 'recommendations', 'sightsee', 'nachi', 'taisha', 'god', 'nachi', 'fall', 'nachi', 'taisha', 'kumano', 'sanzan', 'three', 'mountains', 'shingus', 'hayatama', 'taisha', 'hongus', 'hongu', 'taisha', 'stay', 'hotel', 'recommendation', 'umi', 'hotel', 'ichinotaki', 'old', 'hotel', 'hot', 'spring', 'hot', 'spring', 'hot', 'spring', 'flow', 'directly', 'source', 'meals', 'include', 'katsuura', 'eat', 'tuna', 'many', 'delicious', 'shop', 'katsuura', 'station', 'recommendation', 'reservation', 'hiro', '𠮷', 'one', 'wheel', 'dinner', 'lunch', 'recommend', 'takehara', 'dine', 'hotel', 'manseiro', 'place', 'hotel', 'urashima', 'nakanoshima', 'hot', 'spring', 'circulate', 'scenery', 'stay', 'katsuura', 'hang', 'front', 'katsuura', 'station', 'footbath', 'recommend', 'tuna', '●', 'stay', 'overnight', 'main', 'shrine', 'yu', 'hot', 'spring', 'mountains', 'place', 'outside', 'eat', 'regular', 'inn', 'minshuku', 'yamane', '8000', 'yen', 'half', 'board', 'toilet', 'share', 'old', 'hot', 'spring', 'source', 'hot', 'spring', 'old', 'fashion', 'ryokan', 'azumaya', 'new', 'azumaya', 'speak', 'sightsee', 'tsuboyu', 'hot', 'spring', 'egg', 'visit', 'hongu', 'taisha', 'good', 'idea', 'walk', 'kumano', 'kodo', 'prince', 'shinshinmon', 'main', 'shrine', '1', 'night', 'shirahama', '→', '1', 'night', 'katsuura', '→', '1', 'night', 'hongu', 'yu', 'recommend', 'recommendations', 'permission', 'public', 'transportation', 'vulnerable', 'good', 'point', 'little', 'traffic', 'recommend', 'rent', 'car', '3', 'days', 'shirahama', 'station', 'traffic', 'light', 'roads', 'wide', 'except', 'yunomine', 'onsen', 'train', 'two', 'half', 'hours', 'shin', 'osaka', 'shirahama', 'limit', 'express', 'kuroshio', 'reserve', 'seat', 'time', 'recommend', 'seat', 'side', 'seat', 'right', 'side', 'direction', 'travel', 'car', 'body', 'shake', 'quite', 'view', 'car', 'window', 'shin', 'osaka', 'station', '→', 'shirahama', 'station', 'shirahama', 'sightsee', 'bus', 'taxi', 'shirahama', 'station', 'kise', 'line', 'train', 'movement', '→', 'katsuura', 'station', 'bus', 'taxi', 'nachi', 'katsuura', 'station', 'shingu', 'station', 'train', 'movement', 'shingu', 'hongu', 'bus', 'movement', 'note', 'number', 'small', 'hour', 'half']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True

It's next door, but Nanki in Wakayama is far away, so it's hard to find it (on the contrary, Kyushu is quite popular), but Taiji is a whale town, so I personally want to go there once.

The dispatched uncle who comes to work often goes to Kushimoto with a light can. My hobby is photography, so I'm taking pictures. .. .. Hashiguiiwa will be lit up in the fall (depending on the weather).

I don't remember because I went there when I was a kid, but if you go to Senjojiki, why not go to Sandanbeki Rock?

Can you enjoy eating tuna (by the way, was there a farm for Kindai tuna at Shionomisaki), bonito, spiny lobster, and que?

It's Kuroshio from Shin-Osaka to Wakayama, but if you have the time, you can take the Panda Kuroshio. Tomorrow's schedule will come out around 18:00 the day before.
At Shin-Osaka Station, take the Shinkansen to the JR ticket gate. Since last year, there have been footprints on the floor, so if you follow them, you will be able to go home smoothly (I have it for now, but I'm sorry if it was removed by the time I got rid of it).

If I am a student, I would like to go to Yunomine Onsen on the first day, stay at Shingu and Katsuura Onsen on the second day, stay at Shirahama Onsen via Kushimoto on the third day, and go sightseeing around Shirahama on the last day. (It is enough to take the Ryujin Bus, Kumano Hongu Line, and Road Station Oku-Kumano Line around 15:00 from Asso in front of Kii-Tanabe Station or Shirahama Station.) The

reason is that Shirahama Onsen is an open sea entertainment district. It is said that the overall impression will be greater if you visit the remote mountains of Yunomine Onsen, Kumano Kodo, and Totsugawa Kaido, and go around the gradually open areas.

I think that sightseeing spots and time allocation are quite different depending on whether the center of interest is a shrine or history, nature, hot springs, or gourmet food.

If such as shrines and history, Kumano Kodo and Kumano Hayatama Taisha, spend time to be good to Seiganto-ji,

523,17330,Arara-,JP,Answer date: 2021/06/17,"Good evening, Mr. Hammer Clavier.

I wasn't at Yunomine Onsen, but
I stayed at Watase Onsen nearby .

https://www.watarase-onsen.jp/index.php

This hot spring seems to have one of the largest open-air baths in western Japan,
and when I actually entered it , it was so spacious that I was impressed.
Also, there are 4 private open-air baths that can only be used by guests, and there
are no reservations, etc., and if they are available, they can be locked and used, which
was also very spacious and very satisfying for a private open-air bath.

I went by car, but Watarase Onsen is said to be a pick-up ant from Shirahama Station, and it seems that you can
also pick
up and drop off from Kumano Hongu Taisha Shrine and Kumano Kodo's Outgoing Gate Prince .
I was a car, but I was picked up from Prince Shinshinmon, and
my car was parked at Kumano Hongu Taisha Shrine and walked along the Kumano Kodo.
Access to the inn
https://www.watarase-onsen.jp/access.php Due to


the influence of Corona, Himeyuri is currently closed,
and it seems that Yamayuri and Sasayuri are open.
There are some differences in price plans for each.

For me, on the second day, I got a transfer from Shirahama to Watase Onsen, on the
second day I enjoyed plenty of hot springs, and on the
third day, I got a transfer to Kumano Hongu Taisha Shrine and went sightseeing in Nachi Falls.
After that, I will go out to Kii-Katsuura station, stay at Katsuura Onsen, and
plan to go sightseeing in Kushimoto on the third day .

not the latest, but he went to a special spring visit on June 13th.
I went to Rurikoin on Sunday after 11 o'clock, but in conclusion there was no line.
I could buy the admission ticket immediately, and the worshipers were in their own way, but it was not so crowded. It may be that the number of people was small due to the rainy weather of Corona. However, it seems that this summer's special visit is not well advertised (I wondered if I had a summer visit, I checked the official website), and not a few people know it. Is it?
As for the time zone, I've seen word-of-mouth communication that ""Asaichi is lined with people who want to take pictures, so it's better not to take pictures in the morning"" (although it's just information on the internet). So, my guess is that it's almost always vacant except in the morning (I'm sorry if I'm lost).

579,21245,Oyaji-,JP,Answer date: 2021/02/18,"① I think you should watch for 30 minutes while looking around from the Ohashi parking lot to Manai Falls. It also takes about the same to get back from there. When I went, it was hard to go up and down from the parking lot to the Gokase River. So, I think it's a good idea to give yourself plenty of time and think about two hours.

② I think you can reach Amanoiwato Shrine in about 20 minutes by car. However, there is a fixed time to visit Amano-Iwato, so it is recommended that you check in advance.

③ You can reach Amanoyasukawara by walking for 15 minutes from Amanoiwato Shrine. I hope the weather is nice. I couldn't cross after the typhoon when I went.

592,21323,Kumakichi 's,JP,Answer date: 2021-06-04,"I traveled to Miyazaki in April this year. I rented a car from the airport on my visit from Kanto. I haven't checked trains and buses at all, so I don't know the convenience, but I traveled all over from the north to the south, so I think the only option was to rent a car.

It seems that the sightseeing spots for the second day have been decided to some extent, so if you plan to rent a car, we recommend Cape Toi, the southernmost point of Miyazaki.
When I went there, I couldn't see a good view due to heavy rain and fog, but there are wild horses and I usually cross the road. As far as I can see in the picture, it looked like the scenery would be very nice if it was sunny.
If it's difficult to get there, we also recommend Sekinoo Waterfall. It is located near the prefectural border between Kagoshima and Miyazaki. Although it is a little minor tourist spot, it has been selected as one of the 100 best waterfalls in Japan, and the power of the waterfall is quite impressive.

601,21448,K2,JP,Answer date: 2021/03/07,"unako-san I'm really impressed with the wonderfulness of this site, as I received kind and worried comments from everyone and responded politely each time. I think that you have already obtained enough information, but there are some concerns, so I will add it as an answer. We would like you to experience the splendor of Yakushima and visit it many times in the future, so please read it as a frank reference opinion, although it includes content that makes the already commented person feel bad.

First of all, the history of mountaineering is not clear, but I am confident in my physical strength because I have experienced a full marathon, and the couple have some experience in mountaineering? I will start with the conclusion, assuming that you have. I will explain the details of the reason later.

1) Yakushima has a lot of rain and is characterized by sudden changes in the weather, so be sure to bring rain gear, warm clothing, mountain climbing shoes, and a flashlight. Sneakers are out of the question.
2) Please take action from the perspective of protecting the World Heritage Sites of Yakushima. Please bring a portable toilet as a minimum etiquette. If it remains unused, please use it as equipment when the car is congested.
3) It is recommended to accompany an island guide. Either way, knowing the natural knowledge of Yakushima on the preceding course will double your benefits, including the next climb.

First of all, I would like to briefly describe my experience of commenting on this. Twenty years ago, I happened to have land on Yakushima with my friends, and every year I visit and enjoy day trekking with my husband and wife and friends. I have visited Mt. Miyanoura, Jomon cedar, Shiratani Unsuikyo, Kuromidake, Tatechudake, Janoguchi waterfall, Motchomudake, Ryujin cedar, etc. many times, including guidance from acquaintances. However, tickets are cheap in the seasons to go, June, August, October and December, and unfortunately I have no experience in March.

Therefore, the above reason is as follows.
1) Yakushima is a raised granite island with roots on a thin surface and trees growing on it. This is the reason why Yakusugi was born, but when it rains heavily on the mountains, it does not penetrate the ground sufficiently and flows into the sea at once. Today's muddy stream will be a beautiful murmuring tomorrow. The mountain roads are flooded with water, and rivers that can be crossed cannot be crossed due to flooding. Even if it is sunny at Nagata Beach, the downpour is rough at Miyanoura. Since the schedule is tight, you should be prepared for rain climbing first and think that you are lucky if you do not use rain gear. If it's sunny, please insist that it's Haruo.
2) I am familiar with the various islands that are being developed to protect the World Heritage Sites. We ask climbers to cooperate in various places, so please agree. Cooperation fee (mountain entry, toilet), take-out of garbage, simple toilet (must bring a portable toilet), etc.
3) We hope that you will not only go through the Jomon cedar course, but also enjoy the wonderful nature of Yakushima. Yakushima is one of the world's leading treasure trove of moss and is said to have 600 types. If you can afford it, ask for a guide, who will explain the name of the moss and the natural wonders of Yakushima with a number of Yakusugi. Just by going back and forth to see Jomon cedar, you have abandoned its value. I think that a simple round-trip journey can be done in about 8 hours, but it is recommended that you spend more time observing the surroundings of the mountain trail while trekking.

Lastly, as I have experienced several times, it is better to have a cable tie on hand when using old hiking boots. Recently, the number of cases where the soles of shoes have come off and abandoned during mountain climbing is increasing.

It's been a long time, but it would be great if you could climb Yakushima and enjoy the mild weather and even encounter the snowy landscape. Finally, I pray that Mr. and Mrs. Unako will enjoy climbing Yakushima, which will be a memorial.

On my way home, I came back from the darkness because I was sick and late. Fortunately, I had a flashlight, so I managed to illuminate my feet. I hope this isn't the case, but it's a good idea to bring a small headlight or flashlight just in case.

And I think there was a place to climb the slope along the rope on the way. I think it's a good idea to bring work gloves or gloves.

I think there is still time to cool down in March. If it is heavy, it will be a burden, so I think it is good to bring something that can be light and warm. It's heavy, but I think it's a good idea to bring a little more drinking water.

608,21455,haine,JP,Answer date: 2021/03/03,"Hello.

I went to Yakushima twice, the first time to climb Jomon cedar, and the second time to Mt. Miyanoura and Shiratani Unsuikyo (drum rock). I usually climb mountains.

Jomon cedar mountain climbing is a mountain trail beyond the trolley road, and it is long.
I think trekking shoes (ankle-length shoes, light climbing shoes) are better than sneakers because they have a lot of water and are slippery.

Although I had stock, I forgot to use it at the inn (laugh)
I think that if you are not familiar with stock, your arm will get tired just by having it, but on the other hand, it will come in handy when you get tired on the descent. increase. I think it's safe to have one foldable wand. If you don't mind carrying it around (if it's attached to your backpack), you can even have two stocks.

When climbing Jomon cedar, it seems that you don't have much time to unload your luggage and take a break (the break is about 5 minutes while standing), so if you put candy and chocolate in a place where you can easily take them out, put them in your waist belt pocket, etc. Convenient!

I want to go to Yakushima again!

I think it's not necessary because there are many answers

already, but if you don't usually train your legs by climbing a mountain, you need to stock Jomon cedar trekking. I intended to train by exercising normally, but in the second half, my feet were jerky, and I might not have come back if I hadn't stocked ... I think trekking shoes are good because my feet slip. There are springs here and there, so I think it's best to bring it with you.

a! after! At the end, I really fell on my leg and couldn't stand up ... ^^; ・ ・ I got an amino acid from a person who is accustomed to mountain climbing and got up. amino acid! I hope you can bring it with you.

Shiratani is short in time and I don't think he needs stock, but he may slip on sneakers because he crosses the river along the stone.

By the way, we intended to climb for two days in a row, but the Jomon cedar on the first day was too tight, so we canceled the tour on the second day and slowly soaked in the hot springs to rest our muscles and body, and then on the third day ourselves. I climbed Shiratani. ←

I don't climb Taikoiwa ... I don't know if I dress seasonally because the season I went to is different.

617,21501,Wanderer 's,JP,Answer date: 2021-08-13,"Last year, I drove from Sasebo to Kokonoe IC-Yamanami Highway Milk Road-Kirishima at high speed ... from Takachiho to Takamori-Yamanami Highway-Yufuin. Aso in autumn is magnificent and I like it.

Kanpo no Yado in Kyushu is not useful because I have no experience, but I hope you will visit the course and refer to the points you were interested in.

This is the ""Get off at Kumamoto Airport, rent a car, fly to Hita and stay overnight"".
You can see the savings on rental car drop-off fees at Kumamoto Airport in / out, but does ""fly to Hita"" mean using the expressway?

The highway is open and the driving time will be short, but I don't think the scenery looks great. There is also a highway fee.

There are many sunny days in autumn, but Aso is ""Mt. Aso caldera only when you can see the magnificent mountain waves"", so it is possible to hit the fine weather on the first day as well as part of the Aso caldera. I think the sex will increase.

For example, from Kumamoto Airport to the observatory ""Daikanbo"" on the north side of Sotowayama via Milk Road. From there, take National Highway 212 via Oguni and Tsuetate Onsen to Kanponoyado Hita Tomari. On the

second day, take the highway to Kokonoe IC, then take Prefectural Highway 40 to Aso on the Yamanami Highway. (If you are greedy, you

can enjoy a magnificent view via Yufuin IC) Enjoy the summit of Mt. Aso and Senri Kusa on the third day, and head to Kumamoto Airport. (If the weather forecast on the 3rd day is bad, go to the mountaintop on the 2nd day.) In

addition, it seems that heavy rain has caused damage to the area around Hita.

I can't answer because I don't stay at Kanpo no Yado, but I often go to Kyushu because I have friends in Amakusa, and I'm wandering around in Kyushu, so there are places where I went from Aso to Hita.

From the north side of Aso, take Route 212 and pass Oguni Town to Hita. It's hard to get a sense of distance, but if you only use numbers, you can find the distance and time by searching for Hita from Kumamoto Airport using the Google Maps route guide (the route of the map app on your smartphone).
It's less than two hours, but it takes a little longer because you'll know the detours, such as Daikanbo, Oguni Town, Nabegataki, where you can go to the back of the waterfall, and a strange roadside station. I'm sorry.
By the way, Oguni Town has Kurokawa Onsen. Is it possible to stop by with a drop-in hot water?

The route from Kumamoto prefecture to Oita prefecture is over the mountains, but it is a wonderful landscape.

Another route is famous for the Yamanami Highway. On a sunny day around October, the green shines and is beautiful.

There is a Sapporo beer factory in Hita. The driver can only drink non-alcoholic drinks, but I personally felt that I didn't have to stop by.

In November, there is a place famous for autumn leaves called Yabakei, which is located east of Hita. Yufuin is located south of there, and you can also return to Aso via the Yamanami Highway.

There is a sweets shop called She Tani on the Yamanami Highway's Semoto Kogen, but if it's sunny, the view is nice, so why not stop by for a break?

Mt. Aso in autumn is covered with Japanese pampas grass, and in the evening it becomes a golden world.

In Kitakyushu, the construction of the station building where Moji Station is located has been completed, the historic station building has been revived, there is Mojiko Retro, and there is a humanitarian tunnel that you can walk across the Moji Strait.

It seems that there are many eel shops that think that Yanagawa is only Yanagawa descent, Yanagawa nabe, and loach.
I'm looking into it because I want to go, but I haven't had a chance to go, but ...

Nice to meet you! I went to Amakusa in December 2020, so I would like to answer.

On the Hondo side, I think Alegria is good like Michio-san.
I wonder if the hot springs overlooking the sea feel good.
The room rate is still off-season, so it may be a little cheaper.

I stayed at the Santacoming Hotel and went around the hot springs for a day trip,
but I
was happy that the hot springs directly managed by the agricultural cooperative called the Hondo Gowa Agricultural Cooperative Hondo Onsen Center had an ocean view. ..

I went to meet my friend in Kumamoto in Kumamoto, went by Trans-Kyushu Limited Express, and the inn was Kannawa, so in the evening after arrival, I walked from the inn and went around the hell hot springs in Miyukizaka, and next I thought that the day was Blood Pond Hell, but the next day it was raining, so I just went home without going anywhere, so I don't have any detailed advice. ..


To get to Tetsuwa, get off the airport bus at Beppu Tourist Port (Beppu Transportation Center) and take a taxi.
http://www.kannawaryokan.com/access.html#

I don't know how much luggage, but I think that luggage is a hindrance, so Umi Jigoku can walk around near the Kamenoi bus stop, so sightseeing Take a taxi from the port to the inn, leave your luggage first, and after lunch, walk around the five hells other than the blood pond hell Tatsumaki hell after Miyukizaka, or go to the blood pond hell.

I haven't done it at Tetsuwa, but I have had steamed dishes at Obama Onsen in Nagasaki and Wata Onsen in Kumamoto. I bought it in Shin-Osaka and brought it with me). It's solid, but why not try it at Jigoku Mushi Kobo?

There was no meal at Tetsuwa no Yado (bringing in and delivery is OK), so I recommended walking to the local chicken shop Hide-san to eat at night, but it will be on a hill, so the steam in the Beppu Bay area will be lit up. I was hoping for.
If weekends and holidays are involved, why not go for a walk and take a walk?

However, please be aware that Route 218 is not wide and there are traffic by car and bus.


It seems that Cafe Relas UMI in Umi Jigoku can also get hell steamed pudding.

There is no choice but to feed the crocodile of this time (lucky if there is one), geyser is a matter of timing, but hope is satisfied for the time being it might be.

It will be hot (I also wear a mask), so please take a break and enjoy yourself so as not to overdo it.","Routes when going around hell by route bus, etc.",forum,https://4travel.jp/traveler/taino-okashira,4trip,travel,tourism,stb,JP,https://4travel.jp/dm_qa_each-76642.html,55000,50,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,50,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,50,200,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,50,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,50,0,0,0,0,0,0,50,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,200,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"['hello', 'meet', 'friend', 'kumamoto', 'kumamoto', 'trans', 'kyushu', 'limit', 'express', 'inn', 'kannawa', 'arrival', 'walk', 'inn', 'hell', 'hot', 'spring', 'miyukizaka', 'day', 'blood', 'pond', 'hell', 'day', 'rain', 'home', 'detail', 'advice', 'tetsuwa', 'airport', 'bus', 'beppu', 'tourist', 'port', 'beppu', 'transportation', 'center', 'taxi', 'http', 'wwwkannawaryokancom', 'accesshtml', 'much', 'luggage', 'luggage', 'hindrance', 'umi', 'jigoku', 'walk', 'near', 'kamenoi', 'bus', 'stop', 'sightsee', 'taxi', 'port', 'inn', 'luggage', 'lunch', 'walk', 'five', 'hells', 'blood', 'pond', 'hell', 'tatsumaki', 'hell', 'miyukizaka', 'blood', 'pond', 'hell', 'tetsuwa', 'steam', 'dish', 'obama', 'onsen', 'nagasaki', 'wata', 'onsen', 'kumamoto', 'buy', 'shin', 'osaka', 'bring', 'solid', 'try', 'jigoku', 'mushi', 'kobo', 'meal', 'tetsuwa', 'yado', 'bring', 'delivery', 'recommend', 'walk', 'local', 'chicken', 'shop', 'hide', 'san', 'eat', 'night', 'hill', 'steam', 'beppu', 'bay', 'area', 'light', 'hop', 'weekend', 'holiday', 'involve', 'walk', 'walk', 'http', 'wwwgokuraku', 'jigoku', 'beppucom', 'entries', 'kannawalightup', 'sentomyo', 'taketsuki', 'aware', 'route', '218', 'wide', 'traffic', 'car', 'bus', 'cafe', 'relas', 'umi', 'umi', 'jigoku', 'hell', 'steam', 'pudding', 'http', 'wwwumijigokucojp', 'info', 'restaurant', 'indexhtml', 'choice', 'fee', 'crocodile', 'time', 'lucky', 'one', 'geyser', 'matter', 'time', 'satisfy', 'time', 'hot', 'wear', 'mask', 'break', 'overdo']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,True

I think that the city of Beppu is closer to the actual situation if you think of it as a ""mountain"" rather than a slope, so it is recommended that you choose a bus stop not only for the proximity on the map but also for the downhill journey.
In the Kannawa area where five hells gather, there are high altitude sea hell, Onishibozu hell, Kamado hell down the slope, Oniyama hell, Shiraike hell and so on.

I think the most difficult part is ""I want to see the crocodile meal of Oniyama Hell"".

From the answers of other people, I think that the next morning has already been selected, but I will
add a little information in the direction of approval, so please refer to it if you like.

As you know, Takachiho Gorge is surrounded by high rock walls that rise vertically, but the
sun shines into this deep and narrow valley for a short time in the morning.
If the weather is good and the amount of water in the waterfall is large, the contrast of the light that reflects off the splashes and the gradation of the water surface will be
very beautiful, and you will be able to encounter a more fantastic landscape.
If Takachiho Gorge is one of the main trips, you may want to aim for the time zone as well.

673,23102,masapi 's,JP,Answer date: 2021-03-28,"Hello.

A long time ago, I rented a car in Karashima-cho, which is close to Kumamoto Castle in Kumamoto City, and went to Takachiho at once without any traffic jams and without a break.

At that time, it took almost two hours to reach the ""Tunnel Station"", which is close to the center of Takachiho, so I think it will take two hours at the earliest to reach the boat stop in Takachiho Gorge.

However, I'm a little worried about Sunday, May, which is the holiday season.

If you want to go to Takachiho from Kumamoto city, you can go via the Aso area, which has a good view, or you can take the monotonous national highway No. 445-218 (there is a tourist attraction, Tsujun Bridge).

On a sunny Sunday, depending on the time of day, if you go via the Aso area, the roads from Kumamoto city to the entrance of the Aso area will be crowded, so the arrival time of Takachiho will differ depending on the congestion situation ( I think it will be late).

If you go via the Aso area, you can enjoy the magnificent scenery around Aso, and the Minamiaso area, which is a stopover, has a partly Swiss-like scenery, which is really good.

Maybe I'll go to the Aso area the day after Takachiho, but if I'm planning to go to the Aso area the next day, I think it's less time consuming to go on National Routes 445-218, which isn't too crowded. ..",From Kumamoto Castle to Takachiho Gorge,forum,https://4travel.jp/traveler/masapi,4trip,travel,tourism,stb,JP,https://4travel.jp/dm_qa_each-76508.html,30000,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,100,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,100,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,100,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"['hello', 'long', 'time', 'rent', 'car', 'karashima', 'cho', 'close', 'kumamoto', 'castle', 'kumamoto', 'city', 'takachiho', 'traffic', 'jam', 'break', 'time', 'two', 'hours', 'reach', 'tunnel', 'station', 'close', 'center', 'takachiho', 'two', 'hours', 'earliest', 'reach', 'boat', 'stop', 'takachiho', 'gorge', 'little', 'worry', 'sunday', 'may', 'holiday', 'season', 'takachiho', 'kumamoto', 'city', 'via', 'aso', 'area', 'good', 'view', 'monotonous', 'national', 'highway', '445', '218', 'tourist', 'attraction', 'tsujun', 'bridge', 'sunny', 'sunday', 'time', 'day', 'via', 'aso', 'area', 'roads', 'kumamoto', 'city', 'entrance', 'aso', 'area', 'crowd', 'arrival', 'time', 'takachiho', 'differ', 'congestion', 'situation', 'late', 'via', 'aso', 'area', 'magnificent', 'scenery', 'aso', 'minamiaso', 'area', 'stopover', 'partly', 'swiss', 'scenery', 'good', 'ill', 'aso', 'area', 'day', 'takachiho', 'plan', 'aso', 'area', 'day', 'less', 'time', 'consume', 'national', 'rout', '445', '218', 'isnt', 'crowd']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True

Thank you for paying attention to my question.

I would like to post this because I think that the people who often use the Oita Expressway and the Higashi Kyushu Road, or the local people, have given me some wisdom.

When I moved between Beppu Ajimu on my last trip, I ran on the Oita Expressway and Higashi Kyushu Road, which are famous for their thick fog, but I had a horror experience of the thick fog just before the road was closed.
The specific time is undecided, but I would like to go on a trip again in Oita, but I would like to avoid driving in thick fog like the last time as much as possible.

So
・ Is the thick fog around here all year round?
Or is there a time (season) when thick fog is unlikely to occur?
・ If the highway is foggy, is the general road also foggy?
・ Is there a recommended time for the road?
I hope you can tell me that.
As a place to go, I'm probably staying in Beppu, and I'm thinking of going from Beppu to Ajimu, Taketa City, etc.

I'm sorry at that time. Occasionally, I pass around here.

I've never been aware of the seasons, but it's rather thick fog on bad weather. It is certainly possible that the road will be closed.

If the high speed is not stopped, I have devised a way to make it easier to see the high speed lights even in thick fog, so I am running slowly while watching it. Even if Oita isn't there, it suddenly becomes thick fog, so I understand that I'm surprised.

Although it is a general road, I take the road that goes to the safari that passes through Myoban Onsen (I will go to Ajimu and Usa from this road). When the highway stopped, the highway bus passed through this road. The fog is thick from around Intercontinental. However, the image is that it turns toward Yufuin and becomes thinner as a matter of course at Tsukahara Onsen. (I'm sorry if it's different because it doesn't go to Yufuin so much) It

's an image that the fog becomes thin near the tip of the safari in the direction of Ajimu. That's why short is short, but if you don't know the land, you may feel scared. However, since it is a large area for tourists, many cars are driving slowly. Is it an image of following the car in front? I also run slowly with the lights on.

I personally recommend Oita for sightseeing in all seasons, such as scenery, but I think it would be nice to come when it doesn't seem to rain. In addition to driving, Oita is an image of going around sightseeing spots, so if you have a bad footing, it can be a burden. (But it's okay to relax in the hot springs on a rainy day ...)

The scariest fog I remember was the rainy May. I remember that the day was rather widespread and foggy. Also, although I don't really have a basis for it, I feel like I often drove in thick fog even in the overcast winter.",Fog Oita Expressway and Higashi Kyushu Road,forum,https://4travel.jp/traveler/mayucoro,4trip,travel,tourism,stb,JP,https://4travel.jp/dm_qa_each-76685.html,90000,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,800,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,200,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"['net', 'level', 'sorry', 'time', 'occasionally', 'pass', 'aware', 'season', 'thick', 'fog', 'bad', 'weather', 'road', 'close', 'high', 'speed', 'stop', 'devise', 'way', 'easier', 'see', 'high', 'speed', 'light', 'thick', 'fog', 'run', 'slowly', 'watch', 'oita', 'isnt', 'suddenly', 'become', 'thick', 'fog', 'surprise', 'general', 'road', 'road', 'safari', 'pass', 'myoban', 'onsen', 'ajimu', 'usa', 'road', 'highway', 'stop', 'highway', 'bus', 'pass', 'road', 'fog', 'thick', 'intercontinental', 'image', 'turn', 'toward', 'yufuin', 'become', 'thinner', 'matter', 'course', 'tsukahara', 'onsen', 'sorry', 'different', 'yufuin', 'much', 'image', 'fog', 'become', 'thin', 'near', 'tip', 'safari', 'direction', 'ajimu', 'short', 'short', 'land', 'may', 'feel', 'scar', 'large', 'area', 'tourists', 'many', 'cars', 'drive', 'slowly', 'image', 'car', 'front', 'run', 'slowly', 'light', 'personally', 'recommend', 'oita', 'sightsee', 'season', 'scenery', 'rain', 'addition', 'drive', 'oita', 'image', 'sightsee', 'spot', 'bad', 'foot', 'burden', 'relax', 'hot', 'spring', 'rainy', 'day', 'scariest', 'fog', 'rainy', 'may', 'day', 'widespread', 'foggy', 'basis', 'feel', 'drive', 'thick', 'fog', 'overcast', 'winter']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True

Shinonome-tei, you think you're reading a word of mouth. I often go to the Dogo Onsen Main Building during construction, but I didn't notice that Shinonome-tei was renewed. Therefore, the construction may not have been done as expected. I think it's roughly like word of mouth. The rest will be the relationship with COSPA.

It is said that this is the first time for Dogo Onsen, so we recommend the Yamatoya Main Building. I feel that the quality of the spring is close to that of the Dogo Onsen Main Building. Mr. masapi has also pointed out, but there are also such places. Dogo Onsen has 18 hot springs in 4 locations, so the quality of each spring is different, and I think that only the Dogo Onsen Main Building is exceptional. Only 7 / 5-14 cannot be entered due to construction work, but if you remove that period, you can take a bath in the main building, so please enjoy the favorite Dogoyuno hot water.

I have never stayed at this inn, but when I was on a business trip to Matsuyama for my previous job, I stayed at several inns with the business plan of the Dogo Onsen inn, so I was personally interested.

Certainly, Jalan says, ""We will partially renovate and renew from April 2021."" However, this inn does not seem to have an official website, so we cannot confirm it.

Mostly, will it be refurbished while the number of tourists is drastically decreasing due to this corona disaster? (I was planning to renovate it, but even though I stopped it, I didn't erase that wording).

If it had been refurbished, it would be strange to have those photos posted on each booking site for promotion and attracting customers.

If you look at the reviews of Mr. Tabito, it seems that you are staying at a fairly good hotel or inn, so it may be better to look for a better other inn, but if you want to accompany your pet, Sumimasen.

Also, is the quality of the hot springs in Dogo Onsen really hot springs? ?? If you like hot springs, it's a shame.

If you like hot springs and are not traveling with pets, we recommend ""Okudogo Ichiyu no Mori (former Hotel Okudogo)"", which is located a little further back in Dogo Onsen.

712,25760,Wanderer 's,JP,Answer date: 2021-06-07,"It's my first time in Shikoku, and if it's 4 nights and 5 days, I'd like to go around the coast without being too greedy. I think it feels good to go around sightseeing spots near your accommodation.
The reason is that it takes a long time to move and it is not possible to make it in time for dinner, and it is easy to get tired after lunch and fall asleep on a hot summer drive.
(The highway development is delayed in the southeastern half, and it is difficult to hurry even if the road is

open .) Given that premise, I think that the reverse direction is better than the order of Kagawa → Ehime → Kochi → Tokushima. ..
That is, the first night is around Tokushima City. The second night around Cape Muroto is around Kochi City. The third night is around Shimanto City, Cape Ashizuri, and Sukumo. The 4th night is a night around Matsuyama City such as Dogo Onsen.
There is also a highway on the last day, so even if you stop by the Besshi Copper Mine site, I think you have time to eat Sanuki udon around Takamatsu.
If you have a strong desire to take a picture of the sunset at Chichibugahama or Shimonada Station in Ehime, minimize the area around Cape Ashizuri and Yadoge and use the highway for the third night around Matsuyama City such as Dogo Onsen. Would be good. I want to avoid moving after sunset.

By turning in the opposite direction, you can see the sea better because you drive in the lane along the shore, and in the morning you run mainly westward and northward with the sun behind, so you can see the scenery of the forward rays and it is not dazzling even in the middle of summer. I have. There are few places on the cliff where you have a hard time passing by oncoming vehicles. (Although it faces east on the morning of the last day, it is mainly high speed, not the coast.)

""This is the only place you should go"" depends on your interests.
Nature is abundant such as the cape and the Shimanto River, and history lovers such as Kochi Castle and the cityscape of Uchiko cannot miss it. Focusing on your favorite themes such as hot springs, literature, temples and shrines, and industrial heritage, and (because it is the end of the rainy season), a B plan on a rainy day is also essential.

""Food"" is delicious in season, so it is recommended that you choose seasonal seafood and mountain food (if you don't know, ask for recommendations) at that time (according to your budget).

Take the Tarumi Railway to Tarumi and go to the Utsukumi Onsen.
You can have lunch in the light ink hot spring, but how about a full-course meal of sweetfish?

There is a station called Komi in front of Tarumi.
There is ""Yana River"" about 10 minutes on foot from this station.

https://www.yanagawa-ayu.com/

You can taste sweetfish at a store near Yanagawa.
Pour hot sake into the bowl of sweetfish and drink it. You can enjoy such sake.
The difficulty with Tarumi Railway is that the number of trains is small.
If you are going, please look at the train time and go out.
Tarumi Station and Usumi Onsen are far apart, but there is a bus that connects the station and the hot spring, so please be sure.
There is a one-day free ticket on the Tarumi Railway.
There is also a connection between ""railroad and sweetfish"".
This is Yana Akaishi.

733,27846,Mita Meguro Let 's,JP,Answer date: 2021-05-12,"Hello, Mr. Beruko.

Looking at the text, I don't understand the content of the question, but as the title suggests, if you are looking for an inn where you can see Mt. Fuji, Shizuoka → Nihondaira → Mishima → Lake Kawaguchi ...・ If you come, why don't you just go to Kofu and enjoy the distant view of Mt. Fuji on the Yamanashi side (?). However, on 7/1, I think that there is almost no snow, so I don't think you can see Mt. Fuji ""like a picture (?)"" In any case.

The bus from Lake Kawaguchi to Kofu looks like this.
https://bus.fujikyu.co.jp/pdf/rosen/detail_id8_timetable_202104.pdf
(Please check the latest time.)

If you are in Kofu, it is a little expensive, but ""Castle Hotel""
https: // shironohotel.com/
However, Kofu is a basin, so you can only see Mt. Fuji. A little-known spot (?) Is ""Hotel Route Inn Court Nirasaki"" in Nirasaki, which was about 15 minutes by train from Kofu Station.
https://www.route-inn.co.jp/hotel_list/yamanashi/index_hotel_id_12/
There is a room plan where you can see Mt. Fuji, so it should be fairly famous. I have never stayed in a room where I can see Mt. Fuji, but Mt. Fuji seen from the platform of the nearest station, Nirasaki Station, is wonderful (Please ask Mr. Google for the image at Nirasaki Station Home Mt. Fuji). It should be wonderful if it looks good.

I think that you can go sightseeing in various ways even in the center of Kofu in a day. I don't know what kind of direction my hobby is, but in terms of hot springs, for example, ""Yamanashi Fruit Hot Spring Pukupuku""
https://www.puku-puku.com/
Yamanashishi Station is about 15 minutes from Kofu (opposite to Nirasaki) Direction), this can also be by public transport. Another thing is ""Hottarakashi Onsen""
http://www.hottarakashi-onsen.com/
This is a taxi only, so if you are alone, the cost performance is not good. ・ ・ ・

Kofu → Shinjuku can be JR Azusa or Kaiji, but the highway bus is cheaper and the time is only about 30 minutes (Saturday and Sunday evenings are not good ...), so here is the difference. I recommend it.
http://yamanashikotsu.co.jp/highway_bus/kofu_shinjuku/ In

any case, please check with the inn about ""how Mt. Fuji looks (in July)"".

Thank you for your answer.

Sakaki Chikuma River Rose Park was calling for self-restraint ... I'm sorry.
As you said, there were no gates or fences, so
I think you can enter it freely, but if there is no
rose festival, there will be no shops.

However, in Sakaki Town, where flower production is thriving,
there are some producers who sell directly at greenhouses,
and I think there was a place that handled aroma.
I'm sorry I don't know much.

In terms of scale, Ippongi Park in Nakano City, next to Obuse,
may be more spectacular.
It seems that this year's rose festival will be held here.

Rose Festival in Shinshu ⇒ https://ipk-rose.com/barakai/barafes/

I often see seedlings being sold, but
how was the aroma?
This is also a park where you can go in and out freely.
I don't think there was a permanent shop.

If it is sunny, the view of the mountains from Joshinetsu Expressway is wonderful.
I especially love the view of the Alps between Nagano IC and Koshoku IC.
By all means, I would like my son to enjoy it slowly in the passenger seat.

Sakura Onsen is also a good hot spring inn. (Blog excerpt when I went)

""... A large building seen from Yakeyama Onsen. The road is a straight road and you can't get lost 1.4 km. There are fields, but since it is not a forest, you can see the direction of the Sea of Japan. I am surprised that there is a sense of altitude unexpectedly.
There is a large parking lot at the back of the building, which shows its popularity.
There are two baths, an open-air bath set with a large public bath, and Senju-no-Yu. The large communal bath has large glass windows and a good view, but the open-air bath is disappointing. The hot water is called sodium, bicarbonate, and chloride springs, and it is said to be powered from under the sediments of Yakeyama volcano, but it seems that the amount is large. It feels good on the skin. ... ""

If the via Hokuriku, or the above-mentioned swallow hot spring, or next of Nozawa Onsen (blog Excerpts of Ryokan Sakaya)
is healed to"" wildflowers that are go casually ... the hallway.
The second floor on the opposite side of the Japanese garden-style courtyard in front of the lobby is the Yuden, and when you enter from the corridor, it becomes a large bathhouse in a separate building. The huts on the ceiling are just a sight to see. There is a small open-air bath and a sauna outside, but a good indoor bath is enough. The hot water that naturally springs from the nearest 15M spring source is a sulfur spring, which is a cloudy system with hot water. The indoor bath is a bathtub that is divided into three stages according to the heat. Today, all of this is reserved, and I am very satisfied with the real pleasure of the rewards that came early. Become a fan. ... ”There are also some communal baths.

Jigokudani Onsen (Korakukan's blog) mentioned above
""When you enter Shibu Onsen, you will see a big signboard. A narrow paved road like a forest road is 2.6 km to Jigokudani Onsen. There is a charge for the parking lot at the end.
You can see the inn right away, and you will arrive in 7 or 8 minutes, but it is a mountain road. Bridal wreaths and columbines are in full bloom in front of the entrance, and a clear stream flows through the valley.
We will go to the reception and take a narrow passage to the bathroom. The women's bath and the open-air bath in the back of the men's bath (there is a door from the men's bath) are surprisingly small but disappointing. There are monkeys, but there are three and five in the distance upstream.
On the opposite bank of the river in front of you, there is a fumarole tower that blows up 5m, and there are more visitors to see monkeys than monkeys. The hot water is transparent, but there are white filamentous deposits, so you can soak while watching the monkeys and paying attention to tourists.
The indoor bath is made of old wood and the bathtub is small, but fortunately it is reserved. There is a 70 degree source spout and a water faucet. Somewhat hot. There is also a window at a low position, so you can see the opposite bank. The atmosphere of a lonely inn. ...

This time, in the parking lot of Kambayashi Onsen Ski Resort. It's free here, and it's quick to get back to Manza.
The promenade to Jigokudani Onsen is well maintained, and it takes less than 20 minutes to reach the bath only at the beginning of the climb. First thing in the morning, there are no tourists and no monkeys. If the

weather is nice, take the Shiga Kogen (stop at Manza Onsen if you have time) to Kusatsu Onsen and head to Fujioka. (

Be careful about the eruption regulations of Mt. Kusatsu-Shirane) If the weather is bad, stop by the hot spring ""Yumoto Kamenoyu (reference URL)"" at Tokura Kamiyamada Onsen and head to Fujioka.

but there is a hot spring inn where you can see the setting sun near the driving route.
It is Unohama Onsen in Joetsu City.

Since this is a hot spring by the sea, it is a hot spring that contains salt and
makes your body warm. It's good in winter, but it may be
hot in summer.

I have never stayed at an inn, but I have been to a
day trip hot spring facility.

Among them, there is Hotel New Unohama,
which was closed due to the influence of Corona last year, but it
seems that it will open as another inn in July of this year.

In addition, there are several inns, and among them, Shiosai no Yado Mikaku seems to have a
private room meal plan (not a room meal, but another private room).
http://www.mikaku.net/ All the

inns are located along the
coast, and you can see the sunset from the inn, and if you go to the coast, you can see the sunset.

In Joetsu City,
there is the Kanazawa Sohonpo Inada Main Store for Japanese sweets, and the departed rice cake there is similar to the Shingen rice cake in Yamanashi.
Shingen
mochi is a Japanese confectionery related to Takeda Shingen, while Dejin mochi is a Japanese confectionery related to rival Kenshin Uesugi, which has a mysterious connection.
Kanazawa Sohonpo is a Japanese confectionery store that is also on TV commercials in Niigata prefecture, and
Dejin Mochi is a Japanese confectionery that can be purchased at Aeon in the prefecture.
http://www.syutujin.com/
It is not as famous as Shingen mochi, but
it seems to be recognized in Niigata prefecture .

755,28063,Wanderer 's,JP,Answer date: 2021-05-26,"It's nice to visit the hot springs for 4 nights and 5 days. I used to climb mountains, but for the last 15 years or so, I've lost my strength, so I've been going around the hot springs in the mountains.
The quality and environment of the hot springs, the remoteness of the inn and one-day bathing (my favorite) and the one-house inn vary from person to person, so please check carefully and choose the one you like.

First of all, it is ""Second Tomei"", but after opening, it is called ""Shin Tomei"".

In the ""Metropolitan area → Second Tomei Expressway (scheduled to arrive in Aichi Prefecture in the evening, no plans to stop by except for lunch breaks on the way)"", how about taking a bath at Umegashima Onsen, the most upstream of the Abe River?
(It's a place where you don't have many chances to go because it's clogged up, but from Shin-Tomei, it's closer than from Tomei.)

If you go via the Abo Tunnel, you can go to Hirayu Onsen for a day trip to Hirayu Onsen. If you're staying overnight, you can go to Sakamaki Onsen Ryokan, or if you want to stay a little further away, you can go to Okuhida Garden Hotel Yakedake. (Speaking of greed, Fukuji Onsen ""Yumoto Choza"" and Shin-Hotaka Onsen ""Shinzanso"", etc.)

If you go via the Hokuriku Expressway,
why not visit the hot springs from Unazuki Onsen by trolley train?
Kurobe Gorge, ""Kuronagi Onsen Ryokan"" (the source of Unazuki Onsen) with a real large open-air bath, and ""Meiken Onsen"", which is small.

Also, if you are looking for Sakura Onsen ""Ryuunso"", which is unfamiliar to people in the Tokyo metropolitan area recommended by Arara, we recommend the immediate Yakeyama Onsen ""Seifukan"". The difference from Sakura Onsen is that it springs naturally, but we recommend the hinoki cypress open-air, which has a slightly smaller amount of ingredients due to heating, but has a splendid flea mark on the beam. If you want to focus on the quality of the spring, try Sakura Onsen.

I also like Tsubame Onsen. If you walk a little, there is also a free mixed bathing open-air bath.
I think the morning sun looks good (if the direction of sunrise is bad, you can climb a little or drive to Shin-Akakura Onsen).

In addition, Jigokudani Onsen ""Korakukan"" is a little over 20 minutes on the mountain road from the free parking lot of Kambayashi Ski Resort (only the first climb), but if you are on the back of the Shibu Onsen side, you can walk on the forest road from the toll parking lot that is closed to vehicles. I think it will arrive within 10 minutes.

route, but if I'm a student, I think it's a course that starts counterclockwise from the Sea of Japan side where there are few people and returns with the Shin Tomei Expressway.","Request for introduction of hot springs and hot spring inns on the way to the second Tomei Expressway, Tokai Hokuriku Road, and Joshinetsu Expressway",forum,https://4travel.jp/traveler/kt1000,4trip,travel,tourism,stb,JP,https://4travel.jp/dm_qa_each-76562.html,61875,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,225,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,400,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,100,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"['visit', 'hot', 'spring', '4', 'nights', '5', 'days', 'climb', 'mountains', '15', 'lose', 'strength', 'hot', 'spring', 'mountains', 'quality', 'environment', 'hot', 'spring', 'remoteness', 'inn', 'one', 'day', 'bath', 'favorite', 'one', 'house', 'inn', 'vary', 'person', 'person', 'carefully', 'one', 'second', 'tomei', 'open', 'call', 'shin', 'tomei', 'metropolitan', 'area', '→', 'second', 'tomei', 'expressway', 'schedule', 'arrive', 'aichi', 'prefecture', 'plan', 'stop', 'except', 'lunch', 'break', 'way', 'bath', 'umegashima', 'onsen', 'upstream', 'abe', 'river', 'place', 'many', 'clog', 'shin', 'tomei', 'closer', 'tomei', 'via', 'abo', 'tunnel', 'hirayu', 'onsen', 'day', 'trip', 'hirayu', 'onsen', 'stay', 'overnight', 'sakamaki', 'onsen', 'ryokan', 'stay', 'little', 'away', 'okuhida', 'garden', 'hotel', 'yakedake', 'speak', 'greed', 'fukuji', 'onsen', 'yumoto', 'choza', 'shin', 'hotaka', 'onsen', 'shinzanso', 'via', 'hokuriku', 'expressway', 'visit', 'hot', 'spring', 'unazuki', 'onsen', 'trolley', 'train', 'kurobe', 'gorge', 'kuronagi', 'onsen', 'ryokan', 'source', 'unazuki', 'onsen', 'real', 'large', 'open', 'air', 'bath', 'meiken', 'onsen', 'small', 'sakura', 'onsen', 'ryuunso', 'unfamiliar', 'people', 'tokyo', 'metropolitan', 'area', 'recommend', 'arara', 'recommend', 'immediate', 'yakeyama', 'onsen', 'seifukan', 'difference', 'sakura', 'onsen', 'spring', 'naturally', 'recommend', 'hinoki', 'cypress', 'open', 'air', 'slightly', 'smaller', 'amount', 'ingredients', 'due', 'heat', 'splendid', 'flea', 'mark', 'beam', 'focus', 'quality', 'spring', 'try', 'sakura', 'onsen', 'tsubame', 'onsen', 'walk', 'little', 'free', 'mix', 'bath', 'open', 'air', 'bath', 'morning', 'sun', 'good', 'direction', 'sunrise', 'bad', 'climb', 'little', 'drive', 'shin', 'akakura', 'onsen', 'addition', 'jigokudani', 'onsen', 'korakukan', 'little', '20', 'minutes', 'mountain', 'road', 'free', 'park', 'lot', 'kambayashi', 'ski', 'resort', 'climb', 'shibu', 'onsen', 'side', 'walk', 'forest', 'road', 'toll', 'park', 'lot', 'close', 'vehicles', 'arrive', '10', 'minutes', 'http', 'wwwjigokudanionsencom', 'access', 'route', 'student', 'course', 'start', 'counterclockwise', 'sea', 'japan', 'side', 'people', 'shin', 'tomei', 'expressway']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True

When I lived in Niigata, I went around the Hokuriku Expressway several times.
Among them, I just stopped by, but the
quality of the spring at Sakura Onsen Ryuunso in Itoigawa was good.

I am also a member of the Japan Association of Secluded
Hot Springs, and although it is not by the sea but in the mountains , it is a hot spring that left an impression on me.
It's a sodium-based hot spring, so it feels like it's tossed around.

Sakura Onsen Ryuunso
https://www.sasakura-onsen.com/
There seems to be a room meal plan now.

You can drink hot spring water here,
and rice cooked in the hot spring and hot spring porridge are famous.

I do
n't
know when to go, but if you're heading for the Hokuriku Expressway, the Uozu Mirage is also famous, but the spring mirage is until early June, so it's difficult to plan from now on.
I tried a day trip on a day with a mirage probability of 50%,
but I couldn't see it because the weather conditions weren't right.
There is a seaside station Shinkirou, where seafood is sold, and
because it is by the sea, you can see the setting sun.
In addition, Michi-no-Eki Oyashirazu (in front of Itoigawa) is also a sunset spot.

One of the Japanese sweets in Itoigawa was Miyoshiya's jade tofu, but
it moved to a Japanese and Western sweets shop in 2019, and it seems that cakes have changed.
It is still unclear whether jade tofu is for sale.

Drive trip is good!

Would you like to stay along the coast in Aichi Prefecture on the first day?
I have stayed at Gamagori Onsen or its neighborhood on a trip that came to my mind a long time ago. However, I've forgotten the name of the inn, so I'm sorry.
Is there a hot spring in such a place? It was the impression that.

In June, after the emergency last year, I went on a drive trip from Osaka to Gifu, which was also an idea trip, or one night and two days.
I aimed to keep the Nagara River cormorant fishing since my elementary school trip, but I got on the cormorant fishing boat from dusk, but the sunset was so beautiful that I'm sure I could take a good sunset if I stayed at Nagaragawa Onsen. I thought it would be good to see cormorant fishing from the inn along the Nagara River.
I stayed at a business hotel in front of Gifu station, so I didn't stay at Nagaragawa Onsen, but there is a hot spring inn famous for cormorant fishing, so please take a look at the website. The fireworks went up on the day I went.
The next day, I stopped by Gifu Castle and then returned to Osaka.
http://nagaragawa.org/ When

you get off the Shokawa Interchange on the Tokai Hokuriku Road, there is a roadside station, but there is a day trip hot spring there. I don't think I've entered. I always go out with a day trip hot spring set, but I don't remember because I may or may not enter due to time consultation ...
I had lunch at Soba no Sato, which has a large water wheel along the general road to Shirakawa-go. You may. I think the taste is ok.
https://www.cbr.mlit.go.jp/michinoeki/gifu/gifu32.html

I personally recommend the
""Hakusan Shirakawago White Road"" that runs from Shirakawago to Ishikawa Prefecture, but it seems that the road on the Ishikawa Prefecture side is currently undergoing restoration work due to an avalanche and will only open in mid-July. .. It's a pretty spectacular view. I once passed through Shirakawa-go and returned to Osaka for one night at Hakusan Ichirino Onsen. When I went to the ski resort, it was quiet in the off-season, but I'm glad I felt lonely.
https://hs-whiteroad.jp/model-course/
http://ichirino.gr.jp/index.html
I think that this route will pass through Kanazawa, so I think there are many delicious Japanese sweets! !!

On the Hokuriku Expressway, I ran on the Toyama side for the first time two years ago, stopped by Namerikawa, and stayed at Itoigawa Onsen in Niigata prefecture. The Fossa Magna Museum is nearby.
It was the longest journey (laughs) 440 kilos, starting early in the morning at the accommodation on the first day of the drive trip to Hokkaido during Golden Week.
The hotel I stayed at also had a day trip hot spring.
http://itoigawa-onsen.com/hot_spring

If you can't go to the Hokuriku Expressway,
other people were recommended, but Konashinoyu Sasaya at Shirahone Onsen was good. The private open-air bath was very good.
https://www.konashinoyu.com/hotspa/
http://www.shirahone.org/facilities-list

I always stay around Hida Takayama, so I made a reservation without thinking deeply (laughs) It was a mistake to go to Navi Street, but I just arrived through a road like going to a house with Potsun. .. If you go, you'll be like me if you don't check the road in advance (laughs)
Nigorigo Onsen. The hot springs were also very good, but ... I was very tired.
There is a mountain trail of Mt. Mitake in the back, and you can see a little smoke.

Regarding the question, the metropolitan area → second Tomei → Toyota Higashi JCT, Fujioka JCT → Kanetsu Expressway → the metropolitan area is just a rest at SA, and you don't stop anywhere, it's a hot spring along the other sections. .. There is a shortcut (?) From Takayama to Matsumoto via the Abo Pass Road, but what if there was no good place along the Hokuriku Expressway?

773,28443,Orange 0020 's,JP,Answer date: 2021-04-16,"Marriott, nice to meet you. My name is Orange 0020.

I lived in Shizuoka city until recently, so it may be a little useful.

Some of the most famous places that have changed recently are
the Yume Terrace, which was built two years ago in Nihondaira, and the ropeway facility to Kunozan, which was just renewed the other day.
・ Sunpu Castle Futaba Gakuen, which is far from the city center of Sunpu Castle, is near, but it is possible to observe the excavation survey.


From here it will be a minor place.
・ Utogi Wasabi is a famous place. There is a small tourist facility called Utogi, where you can buy wasabi-related products and eat.
・ Umegashima Onsen is famous. There are several places where you can take a day trip bath, and there are walking paths and some waterfalls, so you can relax and enjoy yourself.
↑ The above only goes along the Abe River. There is a bus, but the number of flights is small, so it's a bit of a problem if you don't go by car.

・ Gaia Flow Shizuoka Distillery A recent local beer is also available in Shizuoka. It seems that you can also visit the distillery and eat near it.
・ Ikawa Lake Ikawa and its shore villages that were blocked by the Ikawa Dam. It is considered to be the gateway to the Southern Alps, and you can enjoy it leisurely in places rich in nature such as Lake Ikawa, Ikawa Dam, Daibutsu Ikawa, and suspension bridge.
↑ The
above needs to deviate from the Abe River on the way. You can reach it by following the Shizuoka Prefectural Road No. 27 Ikawako Miyukicho Line from Shizuoka Station. Again, public transport is not very useful.

・ Chenma Waterfall It is ahead of Shiraito Waterfall and is close to Makai Farm. It's a magnificent waterfall that every local person probably knows.
・ Visit Asama Shrine In addition to Asama Shrine, Hitoana Asama Shrine (Lava Cave ← Visit from the outside this year, the remains of Fujiko), Yamamiya Asama Shrine (the oldest Asama Shrine with many mysteries), Murayama Asama Shrine (Mt. Fuji) There is a former main route for mountain climbing (the entrance to the Murayama mountain trail). These are constituent heritage sites of World Heritage Sites.
・ Lake Tanuki It is an agricultural water lake famous for Diamond Fuji. You can enjoy cycling by the lake with a rental cycle. There must be something else.
↑ The above is the Asagiri Plateau (relatively front side) and the surrounding area. I wonder if it will be a move by car.


There are many more, but I can't show them all, so I'll do this.

As an additional note ... About the Japan Coast Guard Museum Yokohama,
https://www.kaiho.mlit.go.jp/03kanku/kouhou/jcgm_yokohama/

1. If it is a sightseeing bus, it will stop at the parking lot on the new port side (Red Brick Warehouse) I think that it is about the opposite of the taxi stand on the left side of the road), so the distance from there is about the same as going to the Red Brick Warehouse (the parking lot of the tourist bus may change, so Please note.), The entrance may be difficult to find and you may not be able to go quickly.

2. Although it has already appeared, the centerpiece (?) Of this museum is ""a real North Korean spy fishing boat (?)"", But I do not know if it is a part-time job or a volunteer, but a famous guide If you don't listen to the person's hot talk (I think it's beyond the scope of a guide or explanation), the fun (?) Will be halved, so I don't know what day of the week I'll be going. , It is better to go on a weekday or other day when you can afford it.
(I don't know what's going on these days ...)

3. Even if you don't listen to the explanation, it's not a museum that takes half a day to see, but it takes at least an hour, so it includes going back and forth. 50 minutes is not enough to enjoy (especially the Senkaku Islands issue has been highlighted recently, so I think that it may be increasing in various ways)

, so when I have time separately I think it's better to go carefully (Minato Mirai itself has many other things to see). ・ ・ ・

By the way, I think you should ask the tour guide about the time. (When I hear it, don't say I want to go now (the guide hates tourists going out of control, so I'm sure they will say negatively.) I'd like to go next time, but what kind of place? It's good to hear.)

I wish you a wonderful trip.",How long does it take to browse?,forum,https://4travel.jp/traveler/megurou,4trip,travel,tourism,stb,JP,https://4travel.jp/dm_shisetsu/10013505/qa/76525,56400,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,80,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,80,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,500,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"['hello', 'hit', 'additional', 'note', 'japan', 'coast', 'guard', 'museum', 'yokohama', 'https', 'wwwkaihomlitgojp', '03kanku', 'kouhou', 'jcgmyokohama', '1', 'sightsee', 'bus', 'stop', 'park', 'lot', 'new', 'port', 'side', 'red', 'brick', 'warehouse', 'opposite', 'taxi', 'stand', 'side', 'road', 'distance', 'red', 'brick', 'warehouse', 'park', 'lot', 'tourist', 'bus', 'may', 'note', 'entrance', 'may', 'difficult', 'may', 'able', 'quickly', '2', 'appear', 'centerpiece', 'museum', 'real', 'north', 'korean', 'spy', 'fish', 'boat', 'part', 'time', 'job', 'volunteer', 'famous', 'guide', 'listen', 'persons', 'hot', 'talk', 'beyond', 'scope', 'guide', 'explanation', 'fun', 'halve', 'day', 'week', 'ill', 'weekday', 'day', 'afford', 'days', '3', 'listen', 'explanation', 'museum', 'half', 'day', 'see', 'least', 'hour', 'include', 'forth', '50', 'minutes', 'senkaku', 'islands', 'highlight', 'recently', 'may', 'increase', 'various', 'ways', 'time', 'separately', 'carefully', 'minato', 'mirai', 'many', 'see', '・', '・', '・', 'way', 'tour', 'guide', 'time', 'hear', 'guide', 'hat', 'tourists', 'control', 'negatively', 'time', 'kind', 'place', 'good', 'hear', 'wish', 'wonderful', 'trip']",False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False
32,1213,Ryukyu Fever,JP,Answer date: 2021/04/17,"Hello,

""about 50 minutes for sightseeing in red brick"" is probably the time when only red brick is assumed.
That facility has a lot of small shops, so if you like miscellaneous goods and cafes, you'll end up with only red bricks.

I think the Japan Coast Guard Museum is a very spectacular facility for those who are interested in the activities of the Japan Coast Guard. After all, the actual North Korean (presumably) craft ship is on display.
Admission is free and the staff will explain it carefully.

Isn't it one way to visit the museum first?

Next year, I plan to stay overnight in Yugawara and move to Hakone Yumoto the next day to stay.
Therefore, I'm wondering if I can take a quick tour of Hakone the next day, but I feel that Hakone is quite large and it's difficult to see everything.
So, if you leave Yugawara in the morning and arrive at Hakone Yumoto in the evening, would you please tell us what kind of sightseeing route you can take, if you have any experiences?

I love Hakone, so please enjoy the goodness of Hakone!

The flow is like
staying in Yugawara → sightseeing in Hakone → staying in Hakone Yumoto
.
When was I, but will be a prelude to that
move from Yugawara in one morning to Hakone Yumoto, leave your luggage
↓
climbing railway to Gora
↓
Gora from the cable car to Sounzan
↓
Sounzan from to Owakudani in ropeway
↓
Owakudani Take the ropeway to Sounzan
↓ Take the
Ashinoko Pleasure Boat to Moto Hakone (or Hakone Town)
↓ Take the
bus to Hakone Yumoto (U-turn on the same route is also possible if you have time)

.
With this, you can see the typical scenery of Hakone, and you
have just moved, but it is not a big deal in terms of distance & the scenery along the way is good, so it is a route that can be said to be a royal road.
It's an image of sightseeing in between.
Tourist attractions on this route include Gora Park, The Hakone Open Air Museum in front of Gora Station, Owakudani, and Hakone Shrine in Motohakone.
There are various museums in Hakone, and the transportation network is well maintained, so
if you have something you like, you can cut somewhere and head to it.
I like the Pola Museum of Art and the Okada Museum of Art in Hakone, so
If the weather is not good on the day, I think I should cut the Hakone Open Air Museum and use either of these.

Enjoy Hakone's holiday ♪

In autumn, you can catch apples, the apple pie is delicious, and you can see Mt. Iwaki and Mt. Hakkoda, so I recommend it.

I'm not in the tourist site, but if you are interested in buildings and art, I'm telling my friends to come and see it, but I haven't been to Corona yet,
but ""Hirosaki Museum of Contemporary Art "" opened last year. The ""Warehouse Museum"" reference URL seems to be recommended.

When visiting Hirosaki Castle and Western-style buildings, you have to park your bicycle at the bicycle parking lot and return to it, so you may consider moving by bus from the station to Hirosaki Castle.
I don't mind walking, so I walk from the station that is biased to the east of the city to Hirosaki Castle while looking at the cityscape.
It was an impression of a cultural cityscape with many bookstores.

Sightseeing spots are concentrated around Hirosaki Castle and on the east side of the castle. Hirosaki Castle Park itself is also quite large.
In that sense, I think that staying at a hotel in the center of the city between the station and the castle is more emotional in the morning and evening walks (Western-style building illumination, etc.) than staying at the hotel in front of the station. ..

think Hirosaki has probably been there five times.
First of all, you should be able to go to places other than Apple Park in time. Only Angelique is a little far from other tourist destinations.
In my opinion, on the first day, I rented an electric bicycle at the tourist information center in front of the station, (1) Angelique, (2) Neputa Village, (3) Hirosaki Castle (not only the exterior but also the castle tower, moat, and stone wall), and (4) Municipal Tourist Center. Visit. Then return the bicycle to the Municipal Tourist Center or the tourist information center in front of the station.
On the second day, take a bus to the Municipal Tourist Center and walk to (1) Former Hirosaki Municipal Library, (2) Sansha Exhibition Hall, (3) Tooku Gijuku Foreign Teachers' Hall (tea), (4) Fujita Memorial Garden and Taisho Roman Tea Room (tea), (5) Aomori Bank Memorial Museum and Hirosaki Church of the Japanese Christian Church. Next, ⑥ about 800m (walk or taxi) to the five-storied pagoda, ⑦ about 1.2km (walk or taxi) to the former Hirosaki Kaikousha (closed until September 26), ⑧ about 1.3km (walk or taxi) to the hotel. .. I think it's a good idea to rent an electric bicycle at the Municipal Tourist Center and return it at the tourist information center in front of the station.

For dinner, we recommend the ""Creative Local Cuisine Kikufuji Main Store"" or the ""Local Cuisine Dining Hibiki"" where you can dine while listening to the Tsugaru Shamisen at the Hirosaki Park Hotel.

The atmosphere of the building is good here. (In my opinion, though), Jean Jansem's painting itself has something unique, so if the painting doesn't work (because there is literally only this person's painting), please check it out.

The atmosphere of the building is also good. It has been registered as a national cultural property.

I like sake, but this season, the winery that cannot be overlooked in Azumino-Shiojiri (?). It is the most bushy time when the vineyard is called Veraison, just before the color of the fruit changes, and the green of the leaves is also shining, which is the best season to see the vineyard.

357,11863,Mamamaa of Mr.,JP,Answer date: 2021-08-09,"Yuki-san, nice to meet you!
Congratulations on your reservation for Sunrise Izumo.

First, my travel history in Shimane.
Last November, I traveled around Shimane prefecture from Haneda for two nights and three days. It was transportation public transportation + taxi.
I didn't use Tamatsukuri Onsen last year, but around 2015, I stayed at Tamatsukuri Onsen Ryotei Yamanoi for one night and the other night was from Iwami Ginzan. I went around Izumo Taisha Shrine and Iwami Ginzan. This trip is by private car.

If you read your worries from the question, we will understand and describe them as follows.

1. How about Tamatsukuri Onsen as a place to stay for 3 consecutive nights in Shimane sightseeing? Is there any other hot spring resort that is convenient for sightseeing?
2. What is the transportation access from Tamatsukuri Onsen to Izumo Taisha? Is a day trip possible?
3. Sightseeing is at Izumo Taisha Shrine, Matsue Castle. I wish I could go to Lake Shinji.

About 1.
I stayed at an inn that was different for two nights. On the other hand, if you stay for 3 nights, you can stay for consecutive nights, and I think it is possible to travel only by public transportation.
Tamatsukuri Onsen is really convenient in Matsue city. surprised.
I also considered it so that everyone would recommend Shinjiko Onsen.
However, due to the check-in time, I couldn't find a place to eat, so it was a plan.
If you don't go to downtown Matsue, there aren't many restaurants other than hotels. (A store where it is difficult to make a reservation even if there is one ...)

2.
Of course, it is an area where you can make a day trip!
The easiest way is to take the airport bus that runs from Tamatsukuri Onsen of Izumo Ichibata Kotsu to Izumo Taisha via Izumo Airport.
You can also see the timetable at the URL.
https://www.ichibata.co.jp/t-izumo/shuttle/izumo.html
By the way, the timetable on August 26th departs Tamatsukuri Onsen at 8:15 and arrives at Izumo Taisha at 9:30.
Depart Izumo Taisha at 14:45 and arrive at Tamatsukuri Onsen at 16:13. It is one round trip.

After that, take the San-in Main Line to Izumo City Station, and then take the
Ichibata Densha Kitamatsue Line to Kawato Station. At Kawato Station, change to the Ichibata Electric Railway Taisha Line and Izumo Taisha Station.
Part 2: Take the Ichibata Bus Cape Hino Line to the main gate (Izumo Taisha) (in front of Starbucks), depending on the

timing, but the difference between the first and the second is only about 10 minutes. It is the bus that does not walk. The cost is about the same.
If you like vehicles, it's a good idea to take a bus on the way out and a train on the way back.
I think it's okay because the route is downhill, aiming for Izumo Taisha Station through the approach road lined with souvenir shops.

About 3. As

you may know Lake Shinji, there are cruise ships from Matsue city.
http://hakuchougo.jp/
Also, I'm not sure how you think about how to enjoy Lake Shinji, but Ichibata Electric Railway Kitamatsue Line is quite along the lake, so if you move during the day, you can enjoy it with your eyes.
The sunset is famous from the Shimane Art Museum and along Lake Shinji in front of the Matsue Police Station.
If rent-a-car is also an option, it is fun to move from along Lake Shinji to Daikon Island. It is famous for its steep slope called the solid tread slope.
There seems to be a fishing experience, but I'm not interested so I don't know. sorry.

Matsue Castle has a nice atmosphere with many small museums around the moat.
There is also a lot of temptation to buy and eat.
The Matsue Horikawa Tour, which is called the Matsue Horikawa Tour, is good, but what about August? I think it will be fun if the water in the moat is in good condition.
If you look around this area, it will take half a day to a day.

Izumo Taisha also visits in the official order of worship, receives prayers, and receives a red stamp. If you do a full course, such as sightseeing in Hinomisaki, visiting Hinomisaki Shrine, and visiting the Shimane Prefectural Museum of Ancient Izumo History, it will be quite difficult even for one day. Is it finally from morning till night?

From here on, I think that there are roughly 5 patterns of what you see in Shimane tourism, at my own discretion.
1. Sightseeing centered on gods such as Izumo Taisha
2. Sightseeing centered on history and landscape, art
3.1. And 2. Sightseeing that has a lot of movement but is wide and shallow
4. Sightseeing
5. Sightseeing in the center of islands such as Okijima

I feel that the information written by Mr. Yuki is one of 1-3.
When I stayed for two nights and three days, I went sightseeing in pattern 3, and when I stayed at Tamatsukuri Onsen, I went sightseeing in pattern 4.

The first day seems to be traveling and spending time in Okayama city, so I think Shimane sightseeing will be the same two nights and three days as I did last year.
However, if you stay for 3 consecutive nights, it will take 2 to 3 hours for a total of round trips every day, so I think it is better to proceed with the timetable in the plan.
Right now, I have a strong ally called Google Maps, so I think it's not that difficult.

Also, if you are interested in art and gardens, Shimane Prefecture has many good points, so this may also take a day.

If you are centered on God, please visit Miho Shrine and visit Izumo Taisha.

By the way, if you are traveling by public transport, there are some passes that we recommend purchasing.
It is a ""matchmaking perfect ticket"". It is valid for 4000 yen for 3 days from the day of release.
https://www.san-in-tabi.net/ticket/enmusubi.html

Accommodations on Okunoshima are only national lodgings.
As for the facilities on the island, there are only poison gas museums and visitor centers, and there are only shops in the national dormitory.

I visited Okunoshima twice, but the first time was the weekend in March, but I couldn't get a room and gave up.
Therefore, if you would like a room, we recommend that you make a reservation early.

I don't know what kind of direction I like, so it's quite difficult ...

Regarding Ikuchi Island, I think Kosanji is the biggest spot, but I have answered to other people, but this temple is a habitual temple, and people who say ""wonderful"" and ""What's wrong?"" I think that the people who say """" will be divided in half (?), So I think it would be good to go to Oyamazumi Shrine, which will be described later, for the sake of rehearsing (?).

If you are interested in contemporary art, ""art"" is scattered throughout Ikuchi Island.
https://www.ononavi.jp/sightseeing/museum/detail.html?detail_id=630
Unlike Naoshima, it is located in an easy-to-understand place (!) Along the road, so I think it's a good idea to go around it. ..

The so-called Hiroshima Lemon = Setoda Lemon is produced mainly on Ikuchi Island. There are many things those of lemon cult (food too), but if go to Omishima, so I think across the Tatara Bridge, lemon valley at the foot
Https://Remondanigroup.Jimdofree.Com/
(say put a link on their own It seems that Google's word of mouth etc. is more reliable.) Also, it seems that Setoda PA, which is famous for its scenic beauty, can be reached from the bicycle path (I have no experience), so I will go there. It may be good.
(Although you may be able to stop by on your way back from Omishima to Nagoya.)

Omishima (by the way, this is Ehime prefecture) is probably Oyamazumi Shrine. This is the Ichinomiya of Iyo no Kuni, which has one in principle in each country. Starting from the question of why Ichinomiya is located on such a remote island, it is a historic and terrifying shrine (?). A treasure house is also a must. Also, if you like the imperial family, you should definitely visit the Maritime Museum.

""Hakuho no Shio"" that you sometimes see at the salt counter in the supermarket is made on this island.

It seems that we are not doing factory tours now, but it may resume in April.
There is a spa called ""Mare Grassia Omishima"" nearby, but I haven't done this yet.

408,13029,Mallows,JP,Answer date: 2021/02/24,"Nice to meet you. Posting to this site has been suspended for many years, but Shimanami and Tobishima Kaido are my favorite spots, so I will answer.
It may have already been checked, but on Ikuchi Island, Kosanji Temple, which is close to Guest House NEST, is the most recommended. In the precincts, there is also ""The Hill of Hope"", the best SNS spot on the Shimanami Kaido.

Kosanji is a temple theme park, and is packed with buildings that faithfully reproduce famous temples and shrines nationwide, such as Nikko Toshogu Yomei Gate, Byodo-in Temple, and Ginkakuji Temple.
The 350m-long artificial cave ""Senbutsu-do Jigokukyo"" is cool in summer and warm in winter. It looks like a limestone cave because it is dug up to 15m underground.
The Hill of Hope is a large sculptured garden made of 3,000 tons of white marble, reminiscent of the Greek island of Santorini.

Omishima is home to Oyamazumi Shrine, the most powerful spot on the Shimanami Kaido, and the national treasures of the Treasure Hall are worth a visit. It is said that you can live longer and be happy when you go through the ""Gomon of the Living Tree"".

Like Mahina, I recommend Okunoshima, which is a regular boat from Sakariko on Omishima. Nearly 1,000 wild rabbits, one of the best in the world, inhabit and come to you when you show them food. The bait used to be sold at the Sheng Port Office for 100 yen at an unmanned sales office in Honesty Box, but it is safer to bring it with you just in case. However, only Okunoshima guests can bring their bicycles to the island. The island is small so you can walk around. There is no private house.

You can get a walking map at the visitor center on the island. The map shows a huge poisonous gas storage and turret traces during the war, but the concrete air raid shelter that descends on the underground stairs at the Tsukiyama-style part opposite the visitor center entrance is thrilling. However, you will need a flashlight.
You can eat at the former national dormitory called ""Kyukamura Okunoshima"".
If you have a car, you can enjoy the panorama at the highest observatory on each island, but there are many scenic spots along the coast, so please enjoy it.

When I went to Hiroshima twice in the past, I didn't rent a car, but there was no problem. There are trams running in the city, so it was enough.

If your destination is in Hiroshima City or the surrounding area (Atomic Bomb Dome, Peace Memorial Park, Miyajima, Itsukushima Shrine), using the Hiroden (road train and Miyajima Line) will save you time and cost. It is also advantageous in terms of. It is more convenient to use JR or bus for Kintaikyo Bridge in Iwakuni City, Yamaguchi Prefecture, which is the neighboring prefecture.

There are a certain number of lines on both the Kure Line and the Sanyo Main Line, so I think it's okay if you don't bother to adjust the time.

If you rent a car, it's really convenient, but I think it will cost you a
little traffic (feeling)
, finding a
parking lot, and parking fees
.

If the number of people is 4, it is not so much, but if it is 2 people, it will be expensive after all.

It's a tourist spot, but other people are guiding me to major places, so I'll take a different approach.

[Mazda Museum] As
one of the historical industries in Hiroshima, it cannot be missed.
However, it is not possible to view it including the current corona support, so it is recommended to open it by March.


[Takehara Townscape] Although
it has not been expanded so much, I will become a fan with the passionate explanations of the guide volunteers.
It is also in this town that there is ""Miyuki"" that you cannot miss if you aim for okonomiyaki.

Since Abe Monjuin is far away, I'm not

sure if

there is a bicycle rental shop here at Sakurai Station → Abe Monjuin by bus → Asuka Museum by bus, but if you can rent it, you can rent an electric bicycle. .. The place you want is near by bicycle rental, so I think you can go anywhere.
Would you like to return the rental cycle at the Asuka Museum and return to Sakurai Station by bus? Are you going to Asuka station?

Okadera can't go up the steep slope even with an electric bicycle (laughs)
I took an electric bicycle from Asuka station two years ago, but only Okadera pushed the bicycle on the way. It was really heavy to walk on an electric bicycle on a slope. I still remember it (laughs)
Do you go to Okadera while you have physical strength? ?? Do you want to go last? ??
By the way, the course I went to was
Asuka Station → Ishibutai → Lunch “Kotodama” was delicious → Okadera → Sakafuneishi → Manyo Cultural Center → Asukaji → Takamatsuzuka Tumulus → Asuka Station

I'm thinking of going to see Yame's tea plantation.

On Monday, take a bus from Fukuoka Airport to Dazaifu and take a walk around the area.
After that, have them picked up at Yame IC.

However, the flight time is around 9 am, so I'm thinking of re-planning.
I'm thinking of going to Gion station on Thursday, staying at a hotel, and then going to the airport in the morning.

Maybe my reading comprehension isn't enough.

It is said that you will be going to Yame IC from Dazaifu on Monday, but as others have written, I'm not sure why you have to be Yame IC.
(Does it mean that Yame has his parents' house?)
Yame IC means that you can go by high-speed bus, right?
The nearest highway bus stop in Dazaifu is ""Chikushino"", but as far as I can see from the map, it is very difficult to reach from Dazaifu.
I think it is realistic to go from Dazaifu to Nishitetsu Futatsuichi and then take a taxi to the Chikushino stop, but if you take a taxi here, you can walk to JR Futatsuichi and take JR to Hainuzuka. increase.
(Needless to say, Hainuzuka station is right next to Yame IC)

Also, on Thursday, I heard that you will be going to the Kyushu National Museum, which is also just a stone's throw from Dazaifu.
I'm planning to go to Dazaifu on Monday and Thursday, but can't I put it all together on Thursday?
Isn't it not good to enter Dazaifu early on Thursday morning and take a walk around Kyushu National Museum-Dazaifu Tenmangu Shrine-?
There is a rental cycle at Dazaifu Station, so it is recommended to use this for exploring the surrounding area.
(I can't read the rental and opening status at Corona, so I think it's better to inquire in advance.)
Well, it takes time to look at various things, so I think it's understandable to divide it into Monday and Thursday. ..
From the direction of Yame, JR Hainuzuka → JR Futsukaichi → (walking) → Nishitetsu Futsukaichi → Dazaifu.

Regarding Friday, I think it would be better to stay around Hakata Station, considering the next day.
There are various hotels, and now the inbound is calm, so I think you can choose as many as you like.

As far as I can see from my profile, I think I have traveled to a lot more places than I do and have a lot of know-how.
I'm sorry if it wasn't very helpful.

Even if you think about the places around you, if you don't take your lunch time slowly, the impression of Amakusa will be halfway.

The most important points to keep in mind in Amakusa are the Christian Museum with the Amakusa Shiro Jinchu flag (the real thing is open for a limited time), which is said to have been created by Yamada Uemon, the only survivor of the insider, and the Oe Church (including the Rosario Museum). you know.

645,22351,Mahina 's,JP,Answer date: 2021-04-09,"good evening.

I'm in Kansai, but I'm taking you to Amakusa, so it's been about eight years since I started going out to play. I went there last week, and I'm not very familiar with it because it's like a resident. .. ..

Amakusa is a place that takes time because it is long sideways. From the conclusion, it is possible to go around with the plan you wrote, but since it is on the west coast, there may be places where you think ""Oops"" on the way, and it may not be quick, but you can take a leisurely tour I don't think I can. Because it is a plan that attacked the west side of Amakusa, which is long sideways.

Please search the route for the required time.

Car rental office. Amakusa Airport is a small airport with no sales office on site. I also go to the airport to meet Mizoka-chan, but I think that the one I often meet at that time is Toyota Rent-A-Car, but it's a wagon car. The town will be Hondo, so I think the sales office is there. It takes about 10 or 15 minutes from the airport to Hondo. I don't think there are many people, so I expect that the procedure will not take long, so I wonder if it will depart at 10:30. Since it is Amakusa, it takes lunch time to eat delicious seafood at noon.
Oh, there is a famous Tanaka livestock farm in the direction of the airport. I haven't eaten because I want to drink yakiniku, but I have visited the store several times to buy meat.

The following is an incoherent answer because I have written what I came up with for a long time. excuse me. .. ..

I think that the departure from Hondo Bus Center at 17:30 is a rapid train ride on the Amakusa. At the moment, the number of buses is decreasing, and it seems that there is only one bus per hour in the first place, so if you miss it, you will have to wait for one hour. At the moment, I have to wait for an hour and a half, but I don't know when I will go, but this time. Please be sure to check the flight and time as it changes on a monthly basis.
https://www.kyusanko.co.jp/sankobus/toshikan/amakusa/
When I go to February, I make a round-trip Shinkansen reservation one month in advance, so I check the departure time of the rapid Amakusa on the way back and make a reservation. However, the number of flights had actually decreased, so the bus I was thinking of getting on was gone. Although it was resurrected in April.

Unlike an airplane, it's a bus, so even if you can't get on the scheduled bus, you can get on the next flight if you wait, so if you're staying in Kumamoto city, even if you miss one, it's pretty good here. You can also eat dinner and wait at Ikesu Yamamoto near the Hondo Bus Center.

The point of writing is Hondo → Junkyo Park / Amakusa Christian Museum (the road is a little narrow and it may be only Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays, but it was one) → It is not Tsuzaki. Sakitsu Tenshudo / Sakitsu Suwa Shrine → Oe Tenshudo / Rosariokan → Tomioka Castle.
From here, I think I will go around the north side and return to Hondo. There is Oppai Iwa, and Amakusa is inhabited by dolphins. The Road Station Amakusa Center has been built around the corner, so why not stop by for a break? Oppai Iwa can go up close when the tide is low. For some reason, the torii was erected several years ago.

By the way, Junkyo Park and Christian Museum are located in Hondo, so I think you should decide whether to go first or last, depending on your priority and how much time you have left. And closing time.
There is Myotokuji Temple on the north side of the Christian Museum, but I haven't been there yet, but there is a foreigner Jizo.
There is a statue of Lourdes near the east of Junkyo Park. I sometimes go to the drugstore Mori next to it, but I haven't been there either, but it seems to be in a kindergarten.

At the end of Sakitsu Catholic Church is a statue of Maria at sea.

The west coast of Amakusa has also become a location for Subaru commercials, so I wondered if I could meet a wonderful view on a sunny day on the way from Oe Tenshudo to Tomioka.
There are Jusanbutsu Park and Myokenura. There was also a statue of Buddha in Jusanbutsu Park.
https://4travel.jp/travelogue/10885737 Since

Sakitsu Catholic Church has become a World Heritage Site, it has become impossible to drive to nearby areas. When I went there for the first time in a few years, there was a tourist spot like a roadside station nearby, so I parked my car there and walked.

The direction of Kuratake Shrine is different. If you go here, Tomioka will be rejected. I often drive to Kuratake, but it takes about 30 minutes from Hondo to the traffic light of No. 266, which is on the road to Kuratake Shrine. It takes about 30 minutes from the signal to Kuratake Shrine. I was thinking of going on a clear day because it was always hazy, but I went there because the sky became clear in February, but of course it was a narrow road. There are few oncoming vehicles. Although it was a curve, there were places where there was no curve mirror, so I ran slowly and slowly. This lasts for about 30 minutes, so I'm very tired mentally, it was like that.
https://4travel.jp/travelogue/11678556
As an aside, there is a former pachinko parlor in Kuratake where members of the band WANIMA were practicing the band. Who is he looking inside every time he passes in front of him?

The direction of the Amakusa Shiro Museum is also different. It is in front of a product building called Sanpar in Oyano near Kumamoto from Hondo, but the Rapid Amakusa stops at this Sanpar, so get off there and take a tour to the next Rapid Amakusa. It can also be called a ride. However, as I wrote earlier, the Rapid Amakusa train has only one pace per hour, and the time has changed a little due to the reduced number of flights, so if you do this, you will not have time to go to other places. However, even if you rent a car, the direction is different, so I don't think you can take the time.
This Oyano. I think the timing of the signal is bad, but weekends and holidays are a point of congestion. It wasn't so much now, but on weekends and holidays, it's a good idea to check the traffic jam information.

After crossing the No. 1 bridge and leaving Amakusa, the rapid train Amakusa also stops here, but Misumi West Port is also a World Heritage Site. It's calming down, but it was crowded when it became a World Heritage Site.

It's about 20 minutes from Kumamoto Airport to Amakusa Airport by Mizoka-chan, so it's very close. However, the drawback is that the fare is high. .. .. If you go home with Mizoka-chan, you'll arrive in Itami at noon, so it's okay to go early, but it's too expensive to use. ..
If you want to get more freedom, you may want to rent a car from Kumamoto city or Misumi station. However, for example, it takes less than 2 hours from Kumamoto Station to Hondo Bus Center. Misumi Station also takes about 1 hour by regular train from Kumamoto Station, about 40 minutes by train A for sightseeing limited express, and about 1 hour by car from Misumi Station to Hondo Bus Center. Of course, there are no trains, so it is not absolutely recommended because it is necessary to set the time here as well. I wrote it as one of the choices.

The guideline for the time by car is Kumamoto Station-Triangle Station-Hondo-Ushibuka, which takes 1 hour each. There is a road under construction on the Hondoko side. If this can be done, it seems that the distance between Kumamoto and Amakusa will be shortened by about 30 minutes, but there is still more.

It's a nice place, so if you can change it, I think the best thing is to stay overnight in Amakusa for more fun.

Excuse me for a long time.

646,22352,Polar Bear grandfather 's,JP,Answer date: 2021-04-09,"Hi

I like traveling by public transport so I'm unfamiliar with traveling by car.
I went around by bus, but the road wasn't bad.
The Amakusa Seto Ohashi Bridge in Hondo was quite congested, so it may be better to have some time to pass.

Amakusa was a nice place where people were calm.
The scenery was deep in the mountains and approached the sea, and I felt that it was a little like Amami Oshima. We recommend that you first go to the Amakusa Christian Museum

as the order of sightseeing
.

It is displayed compactly in chronological order from the place where Christianity comes in, so I think it will be useful for understanding tourism after that.

In addition, the Amakusa Collegio Museum, which had a wealth of materials related to the Tensho Boys' Mission, had a bright atmosphere with exhibits such as musical instruments and books, and I felt that women liked it.

I visited Amakusa in the fall of the year before last.
I started from Kumamoto station, but Tsuzaki church → Tsuzaki Suwa shrine → Amakusa Collegio building → Oe church → Amakusa Rosario building → Jusanbutsu Park → Five-legged shoe monument → (Accommodation) → Amakusa Mura It was a process.

I think it's a bit tough on Meimei's plan, but if you remove the Tomioka Castle Ruins and the Line of Duty Death Park, it may be possible.
I also recommend the Amakusa Collegio Building. I think this is the only place where you can take pictures freely. I heard that the Amakusa Rosario Pavilion could not be photographed, and the Amakusa Christian Museum could not be photographed, so I stopped stopping by.

I have my travelogue, so I would appreciate it if you could refer to it.

I don't know where I'm going or what I want to do and go around Shikoku, but if it's Kagawa, it's Sanuki udon. I've decided on my own because I'm in my early twenties, but I wonder if it's Chichibugahama or Shimonada Station in Ehime. ??

Personally, I was interested in Minetopia Beshiko and Todaira Zone in Niihama. However, the road to this Todaira zone is as narrow as one car, so be careful when driving.
Imabari Towel Museum. There is also a tour corner, so it's not possible to take a quick look.
Whirlpools in the Kurushima Strait. July 23-26 is the spring tide. In addition to whirlpools, you can also see tankers as they pass near the shipyard. Since it is a strait, you may be able to see cruise ships if the timing is right.

Kochi is a karst plateau, Niyodo Blue. On a hot day, Ryuga Cave can be cool, but as the name suggests, the last tough slope is the stairs.

Tokushima is Kazura Bridge and Oku Iya's Double Kazura Bridge. It's a suspension bridge, so you don't have to go if you're not good at it. It is a thrilling suspension bridge because it is squeaky and there are quite a few gaps between the bridge boards.
The Great Bodhisattva Pass in Anan Town. It is a so-called coffee shop. At first glance, it looks like a ruin, but it's a self-built and tasteful building.

You can check the route, distance, and required time of each destination with the route of the map application (for example, Google Maps) on your smartphone or PC, so please check those points you care about and make a schedule. If you pack too much, you will not be able to turn around, so moderately.

You can also check sightseeing points on Google Maps, so please try to find the place you are interested in.

You can also use a car to move. Since the free day is Monday, many museums and art galleries are closed.

You can also go to a local park to avoid honey. I think the cherry blossoms are over, but are there any parks with flowers (such as Johoku Park and Akihayama Park)? You can also have a drive course on the mountain or coast, or where you can have lunch in a local atmosphere.

Perhaps if you use a private jet, you will arrive a little earlier.
The flight time is a little long, but the total time may be faster because the ride time can be set.
Looking at the simulation of Fuji Business Jet, it is estimated to be 2.09 million yen from Kansai International Airport to Haneda, so it may be the biggest difficulty whether or not it will fall due to business trip expenses.

163,6027,Wanderer 's,JP,Answer date: 2021-07-20,"I live in the Tokyo metropolitan area and have never traveled from Osaka to Nikko Toshogu, but I hope you find it helpful.

＞＞ It seems difficult to change buses and trains from Haneda Airport.

The flight from Osaka will be faster than the Shinkansen, but considering the security passage, it will save less time than walking by transfer.
Buses from Haneda Airport are out of the question, but I think that
trains usually connect to the Shinkansen via Keihin Kyuko or Monorail, as well as from Keihin Kyuko to Tobu Sky Tree Line / Nikko via Toei Subway Oshiage.
However, it is not recommended to take a sufficient transfer time to buy a reserved-seat ticket or waste a lot of transfers because there will be many delays in flights.

We recommend connecting at Tokyo Station on the Tokaido Shinkansen and Tohoku Shinkansen and getting off at Utsunomiya Station. If the bus time for Nikko Toshogu is right, it will be easier to get to Toshogu directly with one bus.

Alternatively, change to JR Nikko Line from Utsunomiya Station to JR Nikko Station, then take a bus to Toshogu.
(If you are accustomed to traveling and the bus time is right, you can get off at Shimoimaichi Station on the way and catch the bus for Toshogu.)

For example, if you search from Shin-Osaka Station at 7:15 on weekdays, it will

take 5 hours and 19 minutes (ride). 4 hours 47 minutes) Transfer: 2 times
IC priority: 18,790 yen (ticket 11,320 yen special charge 7,470 yen)

Utsunomiya Station West / Kanto Auto Works Utsunomiya Station - Toshogu (trivial NT via) - Nikko Toshogu Line .11: 05 shots

I'm not a Tohoku person, but I've been to a distant place several times on a day trip.

However, if you just want to go far, you naturally use an airplane. However, it takes time to access each other's airports, so it is better to go from your home to the airport or to take the Shinkansen or other transportation, and the proximity to the tourist point from the arrival airport and the flight. The good point is to check the return time of the plane and consider how long the staying time will be.

Peach is cheap on weekdays and I don't have to leave my luggage, so I'm in Kansai, but I've always wanted to go to Sendai for a day trip. ). I haven't had a chance to make a decision, but while I was doing this, when I saw Peach's website for the first time in a while, it seems that it was one round trip a day. .. .. There is no time because it is folded back. .. ..

My father didn't like my mother going out, so when I took my mother on a trip, there was a time when I went out on a day trip, and when Peach started service, Kagoshima (Kurobuta Shabushabu) Eat, board the Sakura Ferry and drive Sakurajima), Hokkaido (Noboribetsu Onsen, Lake Toya, Lake Shikotsu Drive), and when Star Flyer was in service, I wanted to ride it, so Kumamoto (enter from Hakata by plane and take the Kyushu Shinkansen) I have made a day trip to Kumamoto (visiting Kumamoto Castle, etc.).

I haven't made a decision, but I'm thinking that I can go to Okinawa on a day trip.

In the case of a car, when I was traveling with my friends before, I was traveling from midnight so that I would arrive at the site in the morning, so I would leave early in the morning. I went to Nagasaki), and when I went to Kochi for a day trip, I went out from the middle of the night, watched whales in the morning, wandered around, and came back home in the middle of the night 24 hours later. There is also.

Why don't you find out where you want to go?

Partly because I've become accustomed to corona, more people are going out than last year, and there are also people who have been vaccinated, so I'm sure more people will go out. I think that there is no difference in ""going out"" whether it is a day trip or a trip that accompanies accommodation, so I am worried about corona infection, so even if I go out and stay by car without using the institution used by the general public I think it's good.
Last year, even before GOTO started, my mother and sister were close by car, but I went to stay overnight. The area around USJ, which was closed, was a little-known spot because there weren't really any people. It's close by, but ""staying"" makes me feel better, so I went to stay nearby several times. Before GOTO, there were few guests, so it was almost impossible to be the same as other guests by elevator, for example.",What is the limit of a day trip from Miyagi Prefecture / Sendai City?,forum,https://4travel.jp/traveler/taino-okashira,4trip,travel,tourism,stb,JP,https://4travel.jp/dm_qa_each-76641.html,35000,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,50,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,50,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,50,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,200,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,50,0,0,50,0,0,0,0,0,0,50,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"['hello', 'tohoku', 'person', 'distant', 'place', 'time', 'day', 'trip', 'far', 'naturally', 'airplane', 'time', 'access', 'others', 'airports', 'home', 'airport', 'shinkansen', 'transportation', 'proximity', 'tourist', 'point', 'arrival', 'airport', 'flight', 'good', 'point', 'time', 'plane', 'long', 'stay', 'time', 'peach', 'cheap', 'weekdays', 'luggage', 'kansai', 'sendai', 'day', 'trip', 'decision', 'saw', 'peach', 'website', 'time', 'one', 'round', 'trip', 'day', 'time', 'fold', 'father', 'mother', 'mother', 'trip', 'time', 'day', 'trip', 'peach', 'start', 'service', 'kagoshima', 'kurobuta', 'shabushabu', 'eat', 'board', 'sakura', 'ferry', 'drive', 'sakurajima', 'hokkaido', 'noboribetsu', 'onsen', 'lake', 'toya', 'lake', 'shikotsu', 'drive', 'star', 'flyer', 'service', 'ride', 'kumamoto', 'enter', 'hakata', 'plane', 'kyushu', 'shinkansen', 'day', 'trip', 'kumamoto', 'visit', 'kumamoto', 'castle', 'decision', 'okinawa', 'day', 'trip', 'case', 'car', 'travel', 'friends', 'travel', 'midnight', 'arrive', 'site', 'morning', 'early', 'morning', 'nagasaki', 'kochi', 'day', 'trip', 'middle', 'night', 'watch', 'whale', 'morning', 'wander', 'home', 'middle', 'night', '24', 'hours', 'partly', 'become', 'accustom', 'corona', 'people', 'people', 'vaccinate', 'people', 'difference', 'whether', 'day', 'trip', 'trip', 'accompany', 'accommodation', 'worry', 'corona', 'infection', 'stay', 'car', 'institution', 'general', 'public', 'good', 'goto', 'start', 'mother', 'sister', 'close', 'car', 'stay', 'overnight', 'area', 'usj', 'close', 'little', 'spot', 'werent', 'people', 'close', 'stay', 'feel', 'stay', 'nearby', 'time', 'goto', 'guests', 'impossible', 'guests', 'elevator', 'example']",False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False

I live in Osaka! !!

Sendai is a good place.
Tohoku trips often start or end at Sendai Airport.

Currently, there are many cancellations, so what will happen when you actually go? ?? However,
if you go on a day trip, you can go to Sapporo or Fukuoka.

Sendai Airport 7:35 to Sapporo Chitose or Fukuoka
return, 19:45 arrival Sapporo Chitose or 20:45 arrival Fukuoka There is
enough time to stay for more than 4 hours, especially Fukuoka Airport is very close to the city So if you feel like it, you can go around in various ways.
Also, if you are in Sapporo or Otaru from New Chitose Airport, you can go directly by train without renting a car.

There are flights between Hiroshima and Itami (Osaka), but it seems that my family will oppose me that my staying time in Osaka will be a little shorter (laughs)
Hiroshima is a distance from the airport to Hiroshima city and my legs to Hiroshima city How is it? ?? I think.

In other areas, Sendai has a well-developed transportation network, so I think it's possible to make a day trip to Aomori and Hakodate, but ...

I've had a day trip to Naha, Okinawa and Sapporo, Hokkaido (laughs)

It's fun to think about! !!

You may be worried that there is no bus that corresponds to JAL287 flight arriving at 20:00, but it seems that this flight has been canceled until 17, but after that it will not be canceled. This certainly doesn't seem to match the timetable for Ichibata Bus until August 31st. As a precaution,

Yamaguchi-Kochi, 3 nights and 4 days.

The best way to do this is to
consider the method that the traveling person thinks is the best .

Certainly the ferry is traffic jam free. When I return from Amakusa, if I take a
bus to Kumamoto Station, there is almost always a traffic jam point, so I
sometimes get off the bus and return to Kumamoto Station by boat → train.
The fare is almost the same.

Ferries usually leave the port on time, so there may be waves and tides, but
usually they arrive on time.
The Yanai Port defense ferry departs at 16:05 and arrives at Mitsuhama Port at 18:40.
It takes about 10 minutes on foot to the station, so if you take a taxi to
the Iyo Railway at 18:49, you will arrive at Matsuyama City Station at 19:04.

If you want to board this ferry,
you have to take the train departing from Iwakuni Station at 15:15, arriving at Yanaiminato Station at 15:45 .

I think JAL arrives at Ube Airport at 9:45, so I
assume that
you can rent a car between 10:15 and 30 and return the rent-a-car before 15:00. : It might be better to return to the sales office at 45.
In less than 6 hours, I will be
traveling around Hagi and Kintaikyo Bridge, so I can't go around, but as you can see, it's a quick trip.
Especially when you get on a car with a fixed time after the car,
you have to act accordingly.

As I wrote in the previous answer, this time + α, I do not know the situation, but
there is also time to see if I can park smoothly in the parking lot.
Whether to run around or cut where to cut (maybe just crossing Kintaikyo Bridge),
public transportation will arrive and depart on time if there is no accident, so
check and rework including the time it takes You should do it.

As for the road conditions, that is not the case, but if you
move on weekdays, work cars will run in the city , so it may be crowded depending on the time of day.


Another option is the Setonaikaikisen boarding plan from Hiroshima Port.
Shin-Iwakuni Station 15:39 Departs Kodama (The difficulty is that it only stops)
Hiroshima Station 15:55 Arrive

Hiroshima Dentetsu Minami Line 16:37 Departs Hiroshima Port Station 17:12, so the flights up to that point,
16:08, I'm
taking either 16:16 or 16:25, but I think it's better to take 16:16 or 25 because there are things like moving by train and ship and buying tickets.

Depart Hiroshima Port at 17:30 and arrive at Matsuyama Kanko Port at 18:47 by Setonaikaikisen Super Jet.
Superjets can only be boarded by people, so
they take less time than car ferries.

Is Peach a flight from Fukuoka? ??

If the peach plane arrives on time and there is no checked baggage, it may be somehow in time, but the arrival gate (because the walking distance is slightly different), the position of the airplane seat (the rear seat after the middle will disembark) It takes time).

Besides, since the LCC runs the plane at the last minute, if there is an arrival delay at the departure airport, it will be a departure delay as it is, and there is a risk that the LCC will use

it knowingly. For example, the limousine bus stop for Kyoto Station is relatively close.

↑ Please scroll down to see Terminal 2.

To get rid of the anxiety of rushing, choosing the next bus is a good idea, but if you can make it in time, you should feel lucky.

Is advance ticket reservation valid only for the bus at that departure time? ?? In that case, if you cannot use it for the next flight due to flight delay, I think it is better to buy a ticket on that day.
Besides, you can get on with a transportation IC card without buying a ticket (be careful of the balance).",Kansai International Airport Terminal 2 ~,forum,https://4travel.jp/traveler/masapi,4trip,travel,tourism,stb,JP,https://4travel.jp/dm_qa_each-76535.html,27500,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,50,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,50,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,50,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,200,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"['good', 'peach', 'flight', 'fukuoka', 'peach', 'plane', 'arrive', 'time', 'baggage', 'may', 'somehow', 'time', 'arrival', 'gate', 'walk', 'distance', 'slightly', 'different', 'position', 'airplane', 'seat', 'rear', 'seat', 'middle', 'disembark', 'time', 'besides', 'lcc', 'run', 'plane', 'minute', 'arrival', 'delay', 'departure', 'airport', 'departure', 'delay', 'risk', 'lcc', 'knowingly', 'example', 'limousine', 'bus', 'stop', 'kyoto', 'station', 'relatively', 'close', 'https', 'wwwkansai', 'airportorjp', 'access', 'bus', '↑', 'scroll', 'see', 'terminal', '2', 'rid', 'anxiety', 'rush', 'bus', 'good', 'idea', 'time', 'feel', 'lucky', 'advance', 'ticket', 'reservation', 'valid', 'bus', 'departure', 'time', 'case', 'cannot', 'flight', 'due', 'flight', 'delay', 'buy', 'ticket', 'day', 'besides', 'transportation', 'ic', 'card', 'buy', 'ticket', 'careful', 'balance']",False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False

If the GoTo discount is resumed, it is not possible to use a direct flight from Shikoku to Tokyo on the way back, but the following methods can be considered.

・ It is

a dynamic package of Tokyo (Haneda) -Osaka (Itami) round-trip air ticket + hotel overnight ticket company (JAL, ANA, etc.), and the price varies depending on the flight used, but it is considerably cheaper than buying separately. Therefore, I use it frequently.

If you use this, the entire pack price will be eligible for the GoTo usage discount, which is a great deal.

However, you can either use a round-trip high-speed bus between Kansai and Shikoku, or arrange a flight from Shikoku airport (Matsuyama or Kochi) to Osaka (ANA only depending on the route).

We are currently conducting a time sale at JAL, so it is sold at a fairly low price depending on the route and flight.

Mr. Imoyokan wants to say, ""Are there any travel agencies that sell packaged products that have the route of Tokyo (Shinkansen) → Kansai (high-speed bus) → Shikoku (aircraft) → Tokyo?""

As you said, if you make an individual arrangement, the discount will only be applied to accommodation and transportation that accompanies accommodation (night ferry, sleeping car ... for some reason, night bus is not included), and the discount will not be applied to transportation. However, it also applies to transportation: ""Purchase a travel agency's ready-made product (= packaged product, including a loose formal package trip such as a round-trip ticket between Tokyo and Fukuoka and a three-night stay only). It should only be ""when you do"".

For example, if you go to a nearby JTB and say ""Please arrange a Tokyo-Fukuoka flight ticket and a three-night stay in Fukuoka""
https: / /www.jtb.co.jp/operate/ryokin.asp
I think that it will do it, but in that case, the goto discount will be applied only to the accommodation, not the airline ticket. (It's the same as booking individually online.) It's a recognition that it doesn't apply unless it's sold as a packaged product. As

far as the process is concerned, it is better to use LCCs for the outbound Shinkansen and the return aircraft (since the Shinkansen is not dramatically cheaper (?) And the highway bus is reasonably cheap) and stay overnight. I feel like it's good (?). (Or look for a cheap Shinkansen ticket at the ticket shop.)

It is said that the reconstruction work of Kumamoto Castle will be completed, and if the world is calm, I would like to go sightseeing around GW. So the question is, what is the recommended hotel area?

The rough schedule is as follows.

seems that Kumamoto Airport is far from the city, so when I come home by morning flight, the airport I have no idea whether it is better to stay around Kumamoto Castle or stay around Kumamoto Castle and move early in the morning.

Sightseeing It is necessary to return the bicycle to the tourist information center in front of the station at 14:00. Travel to another city by train, lunch will be eaten on the train

3 hours and a half on the first day, 4 and a half hours on the second day, there is time Meal time is not included

Where you definitely want to go → Angelique (Apple pie) (Buy), Neputa Village, Hirosaki Castle (appearance alone is OK), Western-style building tour (appearance alone is OK), Fujita Memorial Garden visit and Taisho Roman Tea Room.

Later, if I have too much time to go, I would like to go to the five-storied pagoda and apple park. I

don't have a driver's license, so I can't rent a car, and I plan to ride an electric bicycle.
There is plenty of time after returning the bicycle on the first day, and on the second day, after sightseeing somewhere by bus from early morning (for example, looking at the Western-style building from the outside), rent a bicycle at the municipal tourist center. I think there is also.

How is it rational to go around where you want to go? If possible, I would like to relax.
Please tell me who is familiar with Hirosaki.

If so, it means that it is within the range that can be reached by train and the walking distance (taxi etc. are not so high). Considering these conditions, you can think of a day trip to Hanayama Onsen. Also, it may be good to go to Yuasa and be wrapped in the scent of soy sauce.
As other people have said, Dojoji Temple, Shirahama Onsen, Kokawaji Temple, and Kishigawa Line ""Tama Train"" are also good.

Kyoto is nice in November.
I made a plan to go there in November last year, but when I saw the number of corona patients increasing and I was interviewing tourists in Kyoto on TV news, I thought it would be awkward and gave up going. ..

My favorite of Kyoto sweets is Kuzukiri of Gion's Kagizen Yoshifusa.
https://www.kagizen.co.jp/
This is a Japanese sweets shop that you always stop by when you go to Kyoto.

The latter is Japanese for both evening and breakfast, and there are about 3 private open-air baths with different themes, and the lounge is spacious and comfortable. Since the site area is large, it may be difficult to move to the main building if you stay away. The service is homely and polite.

It's not a lunch but a guest house, but I went there two years ago and was impressed with it, so I would like to introduce it.
Since I'm going to Ise-Shima, it's a fisherman's inn where I found a place with a good reputation for meals on tabelog and other word-of-mouth sites. It's the difference between Toba City.
In addition to spiny lobster, abalone, and turban shells, there were plenty of boats, grilled fish, boiled fish, etc., and it was 14,000 yen for one night and two meals. You should only eat meals, so why don't you talk over the phone about budget, contents, time, etc.

South Island (Dolphin & Sperm Whale) It was really good! I went on a tour called Papaya, but I heard that I'm not on a tour now.

For the land tour, I told them that I would like to go trekking for half a day with Papas, and asked the guide to take me to Asahiyama, Kasayama, and Akagashira Karasubat Sanctuary.

If you have time, it might be a good idea to go to Hahajima. It's a completely different atmosphere.

If you request a pamphlet from the Ogasawara Tourism Association, you will also receive information on guided tours, so I think it will not hurt to have it.

If you want to make a reservation online, we recommend the site called VELTRA. Word-of-mouth communication is described in the content, price, and required time, so it will be helpful when deciding.

I don't go on a night tour on Chichijima, but you can see mushrooms and bats that shine like Hahajima, look for turtles (Is it the release of turtles in October?), And observe the starry sky. Tabinchu-san looks good.

if there is a healthy, Golden Pavilion or to the Kiyomizu-dera

second day
to the check out to the Fushimi Inari Taisha
then, to do Kiyomizu Temple did not go the day before Temple of the Golden Pavilion

, but I do not know what time of the bullet train, if the evening of bullet train
On the second day, I think it would be good to go to Kiyomizu-dera and walk from there to Sannen-zaka and Nineizaka to see the Shijo area (Hanamikoji) from Yasaka Shrine.
If you get tired, it won't take long to take a taxi from there to Kyoto Station.

It's finally going to be cool, so it's a good time for sightseeing.

I stayed in Kyoto in July, and I stayed at a newly built hotel in Umekoji Park called ""Potel"", which was run by JR, but there was a public bath in the hotel and the view from the roof was very good.

I plan to divide Jomon cedar trekking and Shiratani Unsuikyo trekking into two days.

For Jomon cedar trekking, which takes more than 10 hours, I would like to walk with as little luggage as possible. Is there anything I need other than rainwear, beverages, groceries, portable toilets, paper, and regular medicine?
There is also an opinion that sneakers are easier to walk on the trolley road, but is it impossible to walk with sneakers for the entire process?

602,21449,hiroma,JP,Answer date: 2021/03/06,"I went to Jomon cedar trekking (1st day) and Shiratani Unsuikyo trekking (2nd day) last year.
Since the time is different, I think that it may not be the case.

As for luggage, I didn't need a portable toilet and rainwear as a result.
Rainwear just happened to not rain on both days, so I think it is necessary as equipment.
There was no problem as long as the portable toilet was properly used in the middle of the toilet.

From my point of view, Jomon cedar is mostly flat roads, so it takes time and is not as tiring as you might think.
Shiratani Unsuikyo trekking was tired from the full-scale mountain road. (Maybe it's the second day) I

went with light climbing shoes (similar to sneakers).
If it's sunny, I think sneakers (for sports, not casual) are fine, but since you need to assume that you will get wet in the rain
, think about preventing rainwater from getting into your shoes, such as Gore-Tex or waterproof spray. I think it is necessary.

It's Jomon cedar, but I used to go back and forth by mountaineering bus or fixed-route bus without a guide.
On the way back, I arrived at the trailhead early and waited for more than an hour until the bus arrived.
There weren't many fixed-route buses after that, and there was a considerable loss of time, so in the case of buses, I think it would be better to think carefully about the timetable.",About equipment of Jomon cedar trekking and Shiratani Unsuikyo trekking,forum,https://4travel.jp/traveler/hiro_ma,4trip,travel,tourism,stb,JP,https://4travel.jp/dm_shisetsu/10012072/qa/76484,55000,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,100,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,100,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,400,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,100,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"['jomon', 'cedar', 'trek', '1st', 'day', 'shiratani', 'unsuikyo', 'trek', '2nd', 'day', 'time', 'different', 'may', 'case', 'luggage', 'portable', 'toilet', 'rainwear', 'rainwear', 'happen', 'rain', 'days', 'necessary', 'equipment', 'problem', 'long', 'portable', 'toilet', 'properly', 'middle', 'toilet', 'point', 'view', 'jomon', 'cedar', 'mostly', 'flat', 'roads', 'time', 'tire', 'shiratani', 'unsuikyo', 'trek', 'tire', 'full', 'scale', 'mountain', 'road', 'second', 'day', 'light', 'climb', 'shoe', 'similar', 'sneakers', 'sunny', 'sneakers', 'sport', 'casual', 'fine', 'assume', 'wet', 'rain', 'prevent', 'rainwater', 'shoe', 'gore', 'tex', 'waterproof', 'spray', 'necessary', 'jomon', 'cedar', 'forth', 'mountaineer', 'bus', 'fix', 'route', 'bus', 'guide', 'way', 'arrive', 'trailhead', 'early', 'wait', 'hour', 'bus', 'arrive', 'werent', 'many', 'fix', 'route', 'bus', 'considerable', 'loss', 'time', 'case', 'bus', 'carefully', 'timetable']",False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False

Since there is mud on the way

Do you usually exercise?

Jomon cedar trekking is probably tougher than you might imagine.

I ran at the gym twice a week, but when I arrived at Jomon Sugi, I was strained and had a
disastrous experience.
I think it will be useful in case of emergency if you bring a compress etc. just in case .

It is convenient to have hydration as well.

We trekked Jomon cedar on Yakushima in late December 2015.

I don't know the weather in late March, but I
heard from the guide that it snowed a lot just before I went trekking .
The weather on Yakushima
is volatile, so I think it's safer to do the last survey and make appropriate preparations .

It depends on your physical strength and experience,
but I think that it is better to make the preparations as light as possible to prevent exhaustion of physical strength (especially in the latter half).
At the end, my knees were jerky and it was hard for me to walk.
(At that time, I was 65 years old and weighed 75 kg, and I was a little overweight.)
Also, there was a steep slope on the way, and I sometimes grabbed the vines and roots of the grass and climbed
, so I think it is better to bring work gloves to hurt your fingers.
I wore sturdy hiking shoes (
I think the product was ""Kean"").
Since Mt. Miyanoura was once a volcano, the tip of the rock (lava) is sharp and pointed,
so soft sneakers may hurt your feet.
However, elementary school students climbed on steep slopes with ordinary athletic shoes,
so it cannot be said unconditionally.
(Some foreigners climbed in sandals, but I think this is dangerous.)

Shiratani Unsuikyo
does not know much about trekking because we used taxi sightseeing .

Not only can you enjoy the beautiful nature on Yakushima, but you can also
meet the animals (deer and monkeys) that live in the nature, which made the
trekking very enjoyable .

The food at the guest house was also fresh and delicious.

For your reference, I have attached our Yakushima sightseeing blog.

I went to Yakushima last December and went trekking with a guided Jomon cedar and Shiratani Unsuikyo in two days. Will this trekking be guided? I don't think you'll get lost even if you don't have a guide, but considering the transportation to the trailhead, the pace distribution on the first course, and the explanation of the highlights, I think it's better to have a guide. To put it the other way around, I don't think it will be necessary after the second time.

Now, regarding equipment, we recommend that you bring stock in addition to what is already envisioned and what others have proposed. I was in my early 70s, and although I had no problem climbing, I was tired from going down and my legs became unstable, so I asked my guide to lend me some stock. Even on a steep slope, it became easier to go down while supporting it with both legs and stock.

I think Jomon cedar and Shiratani Unsuikyo will go for two days in a row, but on the second day, Shiratani Unsuikyo was a three-hour course to the shorter mossy forest. On the other hand, the young woman who was with me at Jomon Sugi applied for a 6-hour course to Taikoiwa in Shiratani Unsuikyo the next day. I think it depends on your physical strength and age, but considering the fatigue of Jomon cedar trekking, the shorter course was the correct answer. The next day's leg and body pain and fatigue were greater than I expected, and even the 3-hour course was quite difficult. At this time as well, the descent borrowed stock from the guide.

I rented mountain climbing shoes locally for both days, but I was able to walk comfortably with those shoes without any problems. The minecart road was not difficult to walk. With sneakers, the mountain trail seems uneasy. Especially when it rains, it will be muddy.

You may not be so worried because you are still young, but please be well prepared and have fun.",About equipment of Jomon cedar trekking and Shiratani Unsuikyo trekking,forum,https://4travel.jp/traveler/daisuke-1202-it,4trip,travel,tourism,stb,JP,https://4travel.jp/dm_shisetsu/10012072/qa/76484,60000,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,300,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,300,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"['unako', 'yakushima', 'december', 'trek', 'guide', 'jomon', 'cedar', 'shiratani', 'unsuikyo', 'two', 'days', 'trek', 'guide', 'lose', 'guide', 'transportation', 'trailhead', 'pace', 'distribution', 'course', 'explanation', 'highlight', 'guide', 'way', 'necessary', 'second', 'time', 'equipment', 'recommend', 'bring', 'stock', 'addition', 'envision', 'others', 'propose', 'early', '70s', 'problem', 'climb', 'tire', 'legs', 'become', 'unstable', 'guide', 'lend', 'stock', 'steep', 'slope', 'become', 'easier', 'support', 'legs', 'stock', 'jomon', 'cedar', 'shiratani', 'unsuikyo', 'two', 'days', 'row', 'second', 'day', 'shiratani', 'unsuikyo', 'three', 'hour', 'course', 'shorter', 'mossy', 'forest', 'hand', 'young', 'woman', 'jomon', 'sugi', '6', 'hour', 'course', 'taikoiwa', 'shiratani', 'unsuikyo', 'day', 'physical', 'strength', 'age', 'fatigue', 'jomon', 'cedar', 'trek', 'shorter', 'course', 'correct', 'days', 'leg', 'body', 'pain', 'fatigue', 'greater', 'expect', '3', 'hour', 'course', 'quite', 'difficult', 'time', 'descent', 'borrow', 'stock', 'guide', 'rent', 'mountain', 'climb', 'shoe', 'locally', 'days', 'able', 'walk', 'comfortably', 'shoe', 'problems', 'minecart', 'road', 'difficult', 'walk', 'sneakers', 'mountain', 'trail', 'uneasy', 'rain', 'muddy', 'may', 'worry', 'young', 'prepare', 'fun']",False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False

Hiroshima → Takehara has a bus and arrives at 10: 00-11: 20 The previous flight is also acceptable .

By the way, I thought it would be nice to go sightseeing by ferry from Takehara, but it seems that it takes about an hour. Depart at 11:45 and return to Takehara Ferry at 12:50. It's a Nottoko cruise.

I'm thinking of going to Hiroshima Airport via Kochi IC by bus departing at 14:14 after seeing Takehara for 1 hour from 12:50.

However, you may give up on ferry sightseeing.

Now, the question is, if you don't go sightseeing by ferry, I think it's best to carry your luggage at Takehara Road Station from the beginning, but how many hours does it take to see Takehara?

Do you want to take a leisurely look at Takehara or take a ferry to see Shimanami? Take a
ferry to visit the islands for 1 hour. Take a quick look at Takehara for the remaining 1 hour.

Or, there are some highlights, so is it better to leave Hiroshima at 9 o'clock?

I would be grateful if you could give me some advice.

I'm not good at parfaits, so I don't know, but I've stayed in Kyoto and there is only one confectionery that impressed me, so I'll introduce it for reference.

Kameya Yoshinaga's ""Ubadama"" in Shijo is a Japanese confectionery, but it has an elegant sweetness that is similar to Western confectionery.
When I stayed at Hoshinoya Kyoto last year, it was offered as a tea contractor, and I was impressed with it completely different from conventional sweets. Especially the chestnut version was excellent.
The basic is brown sugar, but it seems that various seasonal versions are available.
I will post a photo.

I don't eat sweets because I often go to Kyoto on a day trip from noon to the main cherry blossoms and autumn leaves (I just don't have time because it comes out from noon), but last year I went to Kyoto by staying at Goto. I did. At that time, I had a souffle at Rokusei near Heian Jingu.
https://4travel.jp/travelogue/11651220
Originally, my uncle at work told me ""Why don't you go to Rokusei to eat kaiseki at GOTOEAT?"", And when I looked it up, the souffle was delicious.
If you eat it normally, you will feel like you are eating it earlier than waiting for it to be baked, but the Rokusei building is also wonderful, so I was happy with it.

I had pancakes at the Hosotsuji Hee Tea House in Kawaramachi. I made it plain, but there was also matcha pancakes.
It was 6 years ago, so I looked up the store on Google Maps and found that it was alive.
https://4travel.jp/travelogue/10991862

I'm thinking of going to see the autumn leaves lit up by staying instead of a day trip, but I've always been interested in Saori's Mont Blanc.
https://aim-e.com/brand_detail.php?id=24&mode=
I'm sure I won't go to eat because it's expensive just to be worried. .. ..

653,22445,Mita Meguro Let 's,JP,Answer date: 2021-07-16,"Hello Meyrin.

If you go in order, first from the airport to Beppu,
https://www.oitakotsu.co.jp/bus/airport/disp.php?rosen=01&shubetu=2&period=20210716_20210731&area=44202%2C44341%2C44210
9:45 If you miss it, it will be an hour later (in the case of Oita Airport, you should wait for a while even if the plane is delayed). Let's take this and arrive at Beppu Kitahama at 11:15.

Next, I would like to confirm the positional relationship from the ""route bus viewpoint (?)"".
Https://kamenoibus.com/scheduled/kamenoibus_rosenzu.pdf
There is a description of ""famous places / important points"" in white letters in pink. , Beppu Station, Beppu Kitahama (where the airport bus arrives) is on the lower left. In addition, the ""Kannawa"", which is the point (?) Of this trip, is slightly to the right of the center. (This is the place with the most bus routes.) If the inn is an iron wheel, I think it would be better to go to the iron wheel first and leave your luggage at the inn.

http://www.beppu-jigoku.com/access/index.html The
Kamenoi Bus website is fine, but there are also buses bound for Kannawa. You can also go directly from Beppu Kitahama, so please check it.

Next, on the map of the first Kamenoi Bus, if you enlarge the place of ""Tetsuwa"", you will see ""Umi Jigoku Mae"" on the upper left (in pink white). The hell tour starts here, but the problem is the Okamotoya of ""Hell Steamed Pudding"". There is ""Akiban"" on the top two (pink white) in front of Umi Jigoku, and there is a bus stop called ""Jizoyu Mae"" just above it, but this is the closest bus stop to Okamotoya. (Although it is not included in the common ticket,

Kamado Jigoku is also nearby.) Therefore, it is better to determine if you can (almost) make a round trip by bus 5,24,41 from Kannawa. If it doesn't work, it will be a taxi, but in any case, it will cost you time and money to decide whether to go there and come back.

I think that the sea, Shiraike, Onishibozu, Oniyama, and Kamado Jigoku can be walked in front of the sea hell or even from the iron wheel. Of these, I think you are looking at the crocodile meals of Oniyama Hell, but since it is irregular, you have to wait
http://www.beppu-jigoku.com/oniyama/
. ... In the first place, it seems that the time is not told even if you ask it because of the purpose (?) Of making it irregular, but it may be good to ask it at the wrong place ... If you can see it, you are lucky I think it's good.

After seeing these five, I will move to Blood Pond Hell and Tatsumaki Jigoku, but
http://www.beppuni.com/bus/route/k16.html
It's 6 minutes by bus 16 and it's down so I 'll walk slowly But there is no problem. The geyser of Tatsumaki Jigoku is not specified, but it blows up about once every 30 minutes, so you can see it in a little one hour. There is a bus in the opposite direction on the iron wheel.

About meals
1. Have an early lunch near Beppu Station, Kitahama, where you first arrived.
2. Place your luggage on the iron wheel and eat.
3. Is it enough to eat together at the Okamotoya store in Pudding
? Right now, there aren't any specific shops out there.

I wish you a wonderful trip.","Routes when going around hell by route bus, etc.",forum,https://4travel.jp/traveler/megurou,4trip,travel,tourism,stb,JP,https://4travel.jp/dm_qa_each-76642.html,50000,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,200,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,50,50,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,200,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,50,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,50,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"['hello', 'meyrin', 'order', 'airport', 'beppu', 'https', 'wwwoitakotsucojp', 'bus', 'airport', 'dispphprosen01shubetu2period2021071620210731area442022c443412c44210', '945', 'miss', 'hour', 'case', 'oita', 'airport', 'wait', 'plane', 'delay', 'arrive', 'beppu', 'kitahama', '1115', 'confirm', 'positional', 'relationship', 'route', 'bus', 'viewpoint', 'https', 'kamenoibuscom', 'schedule', 'kamenoibusrosenzupdf', 'description', 'famous', 'place', 'important', 'point', 'white', 'letter', 'pink', 'beppu', 'station', 'beppu', 'kitahama', 'airport', 'bus', 'arrive', 'lower', 'addition', 'kannawa', 'point', 'trip', 'slightly', 'right', 'center', 'place', 'bus', 'rout', 'inn', 'iron', 'wheel', 'iron', 'wheel', 'luggage', 'inn', 'http', 'wwwbeppu', 'jigokucom', 'access', 'indexhtml', 'kamenoi', 'bus', 'website', 'fine', 'bus', 'bind', 'kannawa', 'directly', 'beppu', 'kitahama', 'map', 'kamenoi', 'bus', 'enlarge', 'place', 'tetsuwa', 'see', 'umi', 'jigoku', 'mae', 'upper', 'pink', 'white', 'hell', 'tour', 'start', 'problem', 'okamotoya', 'hell', 'steam', 'pudding', 'akiban', 'top', 'two', 'pink', 'white', 'front', 'umi', 'jigoku', 'bus', 'stop', 'call', 'jizoyu', 'mae', 'closest', 'bus', 'stop', 'okamotoya', 'include', 'common', 'ticket', 'kamado', 'jigoku', 'nearby', 'therefore', 'determine', 'round', 'trip', 'bus', '52441', 'kannawa', 'work', 'taxi', 'case', 'cost', 'time', 'money', 'whether', 'sea', 'shiraike', 'onishibozu', 'oniyama', 'kamado', 'jigoku', 'walk', 'front', 'sea', 'hell', 'iron', 'wheel', 'crocodile', 'meals', 'oniyama', 'hell', 'irregular', 'wait', 'http', 'wwwbeppu', 'jigokucom', 'oniyama', 'place', 'time', 'tell', 'purpose', 'irregular', 'may', 'good', 'wrong', 'place', 'see', 'lucky', 'good', 'see', 'five', 'move', 'blood', 'pond', 'hell', 'tatsumaki', 'jigoku', 'http', 'wwwbeppunicom', 'bus', 'route', 'k16html', '6', 'minutes', 'bus', '16', 'walk', 'slowly', 'problem', 'geyser', 'tatsumaki', 'jigoku', 'specify', 'blow', '30', 'minutes', 'see', 'little', 'one', 'hour', 'bus', 'opposite', 'direction', 'iron', 'wheel', 'meals', '1', 'early', 'lunch', 'near', 'beppu', 'station', 'kitahama', 'arrive', '2', 'place', 'luggage', 'iron', 'wheel', 'eat', '3', 'eat', 'together', 'okamotoya', 'store', 'pudding', 'right', 'arent', 'specific', 'shop', 'wish', 'wonderful', 'trip']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False

Kagawa Prefecture: eat around intently the noodles. Bone chicken is delicious. There must have been a place like Lake Uyuni in Mitoyo.

Ehime Prefecture: Imabari towels, Iwazumogana. Yakitori and Senzanki. Note that there are two types of snapper rice. The bridge that connects the Seto Inland Sea is spectacular. The storm of Hajikawa is nice in winter. Dogo Onsen will go! Sweets are Kiri no Mori Daifuku, tarts, etc ...

Kochi Prefecture: What should I look for in the subsidence bridge? There is also the Shimanto River. Hirome Market should go!
There is a Tosa diary for sweets, but I personally eat Hamako's legendary cream puffs. Also, nabeyaki ramen and nabeyaki pudding

Tokushima Prefecture: Oboke Koboke, etc. There is also a shrine near Tokushima station. Also, the Otsuka Museum of Art (the place where the red and white singer sang there).

709,25757,Miles master 's,JP,Answer date: 2021-06-07,"Depending on whether the departure point is Takamatsu or Honshu, the way of going around will be different and the conditions will change somewhat depending on the number of people in the group, so this is a rough advice without considering that area.

First of all, it is quite a long distance when it comes to going around Shikoku. However, it is recommended to drive on a tasteful general road rather than a highway. There are many narrow places on general roads, so driving should be done with frequent breaks and a schedule of lodging before dark, so you shouldn't be too greedy.

The advantage of traveling by car on a regular road is that you can stop at a roadside station in the countryside, which has a large selection of items. I also recommend it because the local supermarket is cheap and there are many items. On Sundays, the morning market in Kochi is a great open market.

I will omit the tourist spots because many people have already mentioned them, but Uwajima is a small city with a lot of taste. Both fruits and fish are cheap and abundant. Super Fuji, a local churn, also has a big store. Uwajima Castle is also a rare sea castle.
