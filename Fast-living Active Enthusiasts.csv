0,108,UAE,"decided end sept - weather - everything resolved travel . ptc peak summer crazy busy know.
we stayed years beach hotel th floor nice, hotel felt dated much inside , looks revamp thought us.pct nice find atrek forth hotel side dining , close much residence wing buggys.
southall money held dont lake view prepared shot ,
im mindful ahead happy southall good year. trust cant whatever reason trip.
the price 2200 inc 10 nights two adults flights emirates manchester - thought bargain - able upgrade 380 save. wouldnt lock much nearer time.
im liking fact new restaurants bars wont feel perhaps samey got.","we have decided to go end of sept - better weather - and hopefully everything will be resolved for travel . also ptc in peak summer is crazy busy as you know.
we stayed a few years back at the beach hotel on the 5 th floor and it was nice, but the hotel i felt was dated and not much really inside , looks now its had a bit of revamp so thought it would be better for us.pct is nice but i find it a bit of atrek back and forth to the hotel side for dining etc , ok if your close by but it would be to much for me if we were out by the residence wing even with the buggys.
southall who we are doing it with as they have some money of mine held dont do the lake view as i was prepared to give that a shot ,
im mindful it may not go ahead so happy to go with southall as they have been good with me this year. and i trust them if we cant for whatever reason take the trip.
the price is around 2200 all inc for 10 nights for two adults with flights with emirates from manchester - i thought that was a bargain - might be able to do the upgrade on the 380 with what we save. but i wouldnt lock into that until much nearer the time.
im liking the fact a few new restaurants and bars so it wont feel perhaps as samey as it got.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g295424-i872-k13500765-Jebel_Ali_Resort_hotel_and_PCT_and_all_inc-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html,Jebel Ali Resort hotel and PCT and all inc,lovedogs1234,UK,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lovedogs1234?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,50,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,50,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,200,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,50,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,50,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,50,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,32500,"[""['end',"", ""'sept',"", ""'weather',"", ""'resolve',"", ""'travel',"", ""'ptc',"", ""'peak',"", ""'summer',"", ""'crazy',"", ""'busy',"", ""'stay',"", ""'beach',"", ""'hotel',"", ""'5',"", ""'th',"", ""'floor',"", ""'hotel',"", ""'felt',"", ""'date',"", ""'much',"", ""'inside',"", ""'revamp',"", ""'uspct',"", ""'atrek',"", ""'forth',"", ""'hotel',"", ""'side',"", ""'din',"", ""'close',"", ""'much',"", ""'residence',"", ""'wing',"", ""'buggys',"", ""'southall',"", ""'money',"", ""'hold',"", ""'lake',"", ""'view',"", ""'prepare',"", ""'shoot',"", ""'mindful',"", ""'may',"", ""'ahead',"", ""'happy',"", ""'southall',"", ""'good',"", ""'trust',"", ""'whatever',"", ""'reason',"", ""'trip',"", ""'price',"", ""'2200',"", ""'inc',"", ""'10',"", ""'nights',"", ""'two',"", ""'adults',"", ""'flight',"", ""'emirates',"", ""'manchester',"", ""'bargain',"", ""'able',"", ""'upgrade',"", ""'380',"", ""'save',"", ""'lock',"", ""'much',"", ""'nearer',"", ""'time',"", ""'fact',"", ""'new',"", ""'restaurants',"", ""'bar',"", ""'feel',"", ""'samey']""]",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

don't worry about the post which disappeared, they mostly come back after a few hours.
i know both restaurants, the hacienda and french market but i never tried them roasted chicken.
what i can tell is that there is big difference between this 2 places. one is french ( from french kiss divers) with of course a french atmosphere ( we like or hate it ) and the hacienda is more english and so more relax!
the hacienda has a huge place with mini-golf and cinema and petanque and it's a old institution of koh too. the frenmarket is about one year old and the location is next to the main road, more a place to be seen ( frenchies)",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g303910-i9415-k13525668-Unbelievable_100_bahts_covid_menu-Koh_Tao_Surat_Thani_Province.html,Unbelievable 100 bahts covid menu,Psyvolt,US,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Psyvolt?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,50,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,50,0,0,50,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,200,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,50,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,50.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,50,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,35000,"[""['welcome',"", ""'tripadvisor',"", ""'forum',"", ""'haverhill',"", ""'worry',"", ""'post',"", ""'disappear',"", ""'mostly',"", ""'hours',"", ""'restaurants',"", ""'hacienda',"", ""'french',"", ""'market',"", ""'try',"", ""'roast',"", ""'chicken',"", ""'tell',"", ""'big',"", ""'difference',"", ""'2',"", ""'place',"", ""'one',"", ""'french',"", ""'french',"", ""'kiss',"", ""'divers',"", ""'course',"", ""'french',"", ""'atmosphere',"", ""'hate',"", ""'hacienda',"", ""'english',"", ""'relax',"", ""'hacienda',"", ""'huge',"", ""'place',"", ""'mini',"", ""'golf',"", ""'cinema',"", ""'petanque',"", ""'old',"", ""'institution',"", ""'koh',"", ""'frenmarket',"", ""'one',"", ""'old',"", ""'location',"", ""'main',"", ""'road',"", ""'place',"", ""'see',"", ""'frenchies']""]",False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,True,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

also surprised how 'crowded' (relative to me) kata was. off season, july maybe, and it was also, but take away the surfers, and it would have been empty. katamama, and the bar a couple doors down, both with customers, now & then, along with surf shop, now renting sup, since the surf is flat.
stopped at most of the beaches on west side, and they really are lovely, even patong. least favorable looking, though taking nothing away from it, was karon. revamping the one access area, which i never liked, but still, the seas are crystal clear, and every beach except kata, was basically empty.

that route along road isles could easily day, include lunch somewhere short strolls.easy enough too, simply enjoy unfolding scene, photos skye.book ferry well advance.","asif, you might be better starting your own thread about some short time on skye.but some comments on the road to the isles journey:
unless you're a train buff, i would take the car. the driving route follows the train route pretty much in terms of views but has the advantage of allowing you to stop and enjoy so much lovely scenery on route.
neptune's staircase is worth time if the views to the ben are clear as you get some really fine views of it from the canal.


the glenfinnan viaduct - there is a walking route to take you nearer it if of interest. great spot though you won't be alone in peak season.

my favourite views around glenfinnan are from the hotel itself (good for lunch as mentioned) and also from the beautiful st finnan's church nearby.


loch nan uamh has bonnie prince charlie connections too (similar to glenfinnan) - it's a beautiful sea loch with several places you can pull over for photos and just to drink in the views.
arisaig has a nice cafe down at the harbour where the boat to the small isles leaves.gets busy.
camusdarach i've already mentioned and the silver sands - to me, on a decent weather day, probably the highlights of the road to the isles.
i like mallaig though many don't rate it much - there isn't a whole lot to do in it as a final destination; a few cafes and restaurants and shops but it still has the fishing boats, the ferries come in to the harbour from the islands, seagulls keen overhead and skye sits tantalisingly across the sea.


that route along the road to the isles could easily take up a day, if you include lunch somewhere and some short strolls.easy enough too, to simply enjoy the unfolding scene, take some photos and make for skye.book the ferry well in advance.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g186545-i910-k13476171-Friday_to_Monday_stay-Fort_William_Lochaber_Scottish_Highlands_Scotland.html,Friday to Monday stay,Scotlandmac,The Stunning...,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Scotlandmac?tab=forum,0,0,50,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,50,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,200,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,50,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,50,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,50,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,50,0,50.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,37500,"[""['asif',"", ""'start',"", ""'thread',"", ""'short',"", ""'time',"", ""'skyebut',"", ""'comment',"", ""'road',"", ""'isles',"", ""'journey',"", ""'train',"", ""'buff',"", ""'car',"", ""'drive',"", ""'route',"", ""'train',"", ""'route',"", ""'pretty',"", ""'much',"", ""'term',"", ""'view',"", ""'advantage',"", ""'allow',"", ""'stop',"", ""'much',"", ""'scenery',"", ""'route',"", ""'neptunes',"", ""'staircase',"", ""'worth',"", ""'time',"", ""'view',"", ""'ben',"", ""'clear',"", ""'fine',"", ""'view',"", ""'canal',"", ""'glenfinnan',"", ""'viaduct',"", ""'walk',"", ""'route',"", ""'nearer',"", ""'interest',"", ""'spot',"", ""'alone',"", ""'peak',"", ""'season',"", ""'favourite',"", ""'view',"", ""'glenfinnan',"", ""'hotel',"", ""'good',"", ""'lunch',"", ""'beautiful',"", ""'st',"", ""'finnans',"", ""'church',"", ""'nearby',"", ""'loch',"", ""'nan',"", ""'uamh',"", ""'bonnie',"", ""'prince',"", ""'charlie',"", ""'connections',"", ""'similar',"", ""'glenfinnan',"", ""'beautiful',"", ""'sea',"", ""'loch',"", ""'place',"", ""'pull',"", ""'photos',"", ""'drink',"", ""'view',"", ""'arisaig',"", ""'cafe',"", ""'harbour',"", ""'boat',"", ""'small',"", ""'isles',"", ""'leavesgets',"", ""'busy',"", ""'camusdarach',"", ""'silver',"", ""'sand',"", ""'decent',"", ""'weather',"", ""'day',"", ""'highlight',"", ""'road',"", ""'isles',"", ""'mallaig',"", ""'many',"", ""'rate',"", ""'much',"", ""'isnt',"", ""'whole',"", ""'lot',"", ""'final',"", ""'destination',"", ""'cafes',"", ""'restaurants',"", ""'shop',"", ""'fish',"", ""'boat',"", ""'ferry',"", ""'harbour',"", ""'islands',"", ""'seagulls',"", ""'keen',"", ""'overhead',"", ""'skye',"", ""'sit',"", ""'tantalisingly',"", ""'sea',"", ""'route',"", ""'road',"", ""'isles',"", ""'easily',"", ""'day',"", ""'include',"", ""'lunch',"", ""'short',"", ""'strollseasy',"", ""'simply',"", ""'unfold',"", ""'scene',"", ""'photos',"", ""'skyebook',"", ""'ferry',"", ""'advance']""]",False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,True,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

i you’re safe well! :) i’m currently planning trip outer hebrides normally consider short notice end june/beginning july (i experience orkney, shetland, mull etc. appreciate islands usually start book far advance) – covid situation is, i'm starting confident book something, i’d questions locals regulars forum!
1. usually avoid july remote inner-scottish trips order avoid midges families kids school/general high season lots campervans – wondering expect notable impact choose go.
i’d guess islands windy enough former problem, accommodation limited (and campervans currently restricted official campsites, read), much capacity visitors. wanted check time bad idea go. i’m worried weather, accept unpredictable (even aware usually ideal scottish travel month – looking weather brought us, left rely ;) ).
2. many forum, i’m wondering split time. terms i'm looking for, i'm usually interested everything. hiking, beaches (the best ones told!), sights (everything castles distilleries), good restaurant two (if open). i’ll something 7-10 nights – limiting factor cost.
i’ve seen suggestion forum something nights lewis&harris, uists/benbecula barra 10 night split, wondering best cut i’d need shorter, want rush it. end 8, thinking leave barra future trip (possibly connection coll tiree) - worth going day trip south uist case? drive straight skip uists/benbecula case visit barra instead? aware cut enough weeks every islands - i'd rather sure cut ""right"" needed.
apologies long message – i’d usually try lot research coming refined questions, short notice making eager little nervous book accommodation/car/flights asap.
thank much stay safe!
sebastian","hey all,
i hope you’re all safe and well! :) i’m currently planning my first trip to the outer hebrides at what i would normally consider too short notice this end of june/beginning of july (i have experience with orkney, shetland, mull etc. and appreciate the islands usually start to book up far in advance) – but with the covid situation being what it is, i'm just now starting to get confident to actually book something, and i’d have a few questions for the locals and regulars on the forum!
1. i usually avoid july for more remote inner-scottish trips in order to avoid both the midges and the families with kids out of school/general high season and lots of campervans – and was wondering if i should expect either to have a notable impact should i choose to go.
i’d guess the islands are windy enough for the former to not be a problem, and with accommodation limited (and campervans currently restricted to the official campsites, or so i have read), there is only so much capacity for visitors. but just wanted to check if that time is a bad idea to go. i’m not so worried about the weather, i accept that that is unpredictable as it is (even though i am aware usually may is the ideal scottish travel month – but looking at the weather just now and what this may has brought us, what is there left to rely on ;) ).
2. like so many on the forum, i’m wondering about how to split my time. in terms of what i'm looking for, i'm usually interested in a bit of everything. hiking, beaches (the best ones up there i have been told!), sights (everything from castles to distilleries), and a good restaurant or two (if those are open). i’ll have something like 7-10 nights – the limiting factor is cost.
i’ve seen suggestion on the forum to do something like 4 nights for lewis&harris, 3 uists/benbecula and 3 for barra for a 10 night split, and was just wondering where would be best to cut if i’d need to go shorter, since i don't want to rush it. if i end up with 7 or 8, i was thinking to leave out barra for a future trip (possibly in connection with coll and tiree) - or would it be worth going over for a day trip from south uist in any case? or should i drive straight through and skip the uists/benbecula in that case and visit barra instead? i am aware i will always have to cut things out and there is probably enough to do for weeks on each and every one of the islands - but i'd rather make sure to cut the ""right"" things if needed.
apologies for the long message – i’d usually try to do a lot more research myself before coming with more refined questions, but the short notice is making me eager and a little nervous to book accommodation/car/flights asap.
thank you all so much and stay safe!

when the core clientele take “drink as much as you can’ as an instruction or challenge rather than advice, there’s little point in trying to be something else.
speaking from a position of experience of course; i went to sharm for a diving holiday and never touched a boat or the sea. 🥃

you're right it wasn't the best, long queues for everything,
not a good variety of food,
tired fitting and fixtures, loud music banging all day long from beach club either side of the hotel, until early hours, no social distancing around the small pool area, sunbeds really disgusting,holes in most beach towels.
could go on and on,
but we found most staff helpful and polite, and the hotel was clean, it certainly need an update, the location was also good.
the a la carte, restaurants were good, we could use these if booked in advance instead of the evening buffet.
enjoyed our holiday as the weather was great, and met some nice people, but would not return.
made the most of it as we were very luck to go with the current virus situation
not surprised they put dubai back on the travel corridor as we found itvti be very busy after the new year.

we walked with ease the vegas strip at midday and whilst phoenix was hotter it was manageable and we could eat outside with some degree of comfort , although most places did have misters .
no chance of that in dubai, its just to hot.
hotter than than and more uncomfortable would be singapore. ive never found the states that hot at that time ever.
a lot can be achieved in doors and early pm . dubai mall is really lovely in the pm so you could do burj khallifa before it gets dark then move on to the mall /fountains etc. its a huge mall with some highly expensive shops .
mall of the emirates is pretty standard now , but worth a trip if you want to ski at ski dubai.
atlantis and jumeriah beach are nice .
marina more for the late pm with the bars and restaurants - maybe do yellow boats tour but prob best when it is a bit cooler ie late pm.
i would say the theme parks are not as good as the states . ferrari world i thought was a bit to educational but it draws in people for that big ride. never done img i think a lot is indoors as well.

can just have a drink and watch your child learn to climb safely, there is one at ambleside as well but not tried that, it is a lot smaller. we prefer ambleside as it is central for most places, it has craxy golf, putting, tennis as well and some easier walks, such as to grasmere. as someone said ambleside yha is good, best place in the lakes to sit outside and have a drink right on the lake,

at present due covid-19 kuta hustle/bustle usually post covid-19 quite knows better!
i comment kuta low season (not aussie school holiday season/s christmas/new year) e.g may/june (when usually stay) stayed august & oct/november.(oct/november 2019 kuta quiet).
australian school holidays expect kuta busier lots aussies about.
while kuta 'party area' (late night/early morning) 'party area' small section along jl legian (the main street kuta legian).
you walk past area day & night, interest keep walking.
some bars/restaurants music, e.g guitarist, vocalist/guitarist band.
kuta known accommodation backpackers, surfers, budget travellers days
singles, couples, groups, families stay kuta. guests ages young 80's.
the surf rolling waves suitable swimming (it rips) boogie boarding/surfers.
you eat cheap kuta find restaurants/warung add tax total food bill.
beach bars (esky ice cold drinks) trees south kuta gate (the main entrance onto kuta beach.
beach bars kuta beach find beach bars along beach legian/seminyak.
beach lounges hired beach walk away (north) main kuta beach area.
kuta shopping whether market shops bargain prices e.g beachwear, bags, hats, sunglasses, shoes/sandals, souvenirs fixed price shops e.g beachwalk bali shopping complex, matahari department store (may return), kuta galleria, lippo plaza sunset road, discovery mall & lippo mall south kuta (tuban).

yes traffic, peak times day/evening/night busier roads & traffic moves slower, jl pantai kuta way traffic, jl bakungsari (jl singosari)one way, jl legian (from jl melasti) kuta way,jl kartika plaza two way traffic.
walk kuta south kuta (tuban) along beachfront path, pleasant walk, along beach legian (north) & seminyak streets (footpaths).","you don't say in your op when you have booked (what month) to stay in kuta and why kuta was your choice?
at present due to covid-19 kuta is not the hustle/bustle is usually is and post covid-19 it may not quite be the same as it was or who knows it may be even better!
i can only comment on kuta in low season (not aussie school holiday season/s or christmas/new year) e.g may/june (when we usually stay) also have stayed in august & oct/november.(oct/november 2019 kuta was very quiet).
australian school holidays you would expect that kuta is busier with lots more aussies about.
while most think of kuta as the 'party area' (late night/early morning) the 'party area' is one small section along jl legian (the main street from kuta to legian).
you can walk past this area during the day & at night, if it is of no interest to you just keep walking.
some bars/restaurants do have music, e.g a guitarist, vocalist/guitarist or band.
kuta is also most known for it's accommodation for backpackers, surfers, budget travellers but these days
singles, couples, groups, families stay in kuta. guests ages from the young to their 80's.
the surf is rolling waves so not really suitable for swimming (it also has rips) more for boogie boarding/surfers.
you can still eat cheap in kuta where you will find restaurants/warung that don't add tax to the total of the food bill.
beach bars (esky with ice cold drinks) under the trees south of kuta gate (the main entrance onto kuta beach.
beach bars on kuta beach and you will find beach bars along the beach to legian/seminyak.
beach lounges can be hired on the beach as you walk away (north) from the main kuta beach area.
kuta is also shopping whether it's market shops where you can bargain prices for e.g beachwear, bags, hats, sunglasses, shoes/sandals, souvenirs etc or fixed price shops e.g beachwalk bali shopping complex, matahari department store (may not be there when we get to return), kuta galleria, lippo plaza sunset road, discovery mall & lippo mall both in south kuta (tuban).
waterbom waterslide park also in south kuta on jl kartika plaza.
yes there is traffic, during peak times of the day/evening/night it's busier on the roads & traffic moves slower, jl pantai kuta is one way traffic, jl bakungsari (jl singosari)one way, jl legian (from jl melasti) to kuta one way,jl kartika plaza two way traffic.
walk from kuta to south kuta (tuban) along the beachfront path, a very pleasant walk, along the beach to legian (north) & seminyak or the streets (footpaths).",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g294226-i7220-k13467742-Kuta_Bali_is_it_a_nice_place_to_stay-Bali.html,"Kuta, Bali - is it a nice place to stay?",Summerhama58,Sans

34,1982,ID,"good info aside ubud - gili - “down south” popular itinerary.
fastboats
easily done fastboat companies include free pickup ubud free dropoff “down south” return.
if want best fastboat company www.bluewater-express.com widely acknowledged best company (we gili serangan/“down south”). companies services padangbai (ideal ubud) “direct” service gilis serangan (ideal “down south”).
ubud
there lots villas highend accommodation available wary location want close town/amenities. check exact location property carefully. never believe property bumf location name indication location. ubud town, ubud district (up 8km town directions) “nowhere near ubud we’ll call ubud 20km/1hr drive town”. best examples worst “padma ubud”.
gili t
the gili islands vehicle free. people walk around, cycle donkey/trap.
the islands aren’t big. cycle gili 40minutes.
best decide part island want stay there. e.g. east/southeast side fastboats arrive main party area. stay area dive resort ( www.manta-dive.com ) interested diving snorkeling.
west side goodchoice accommodation local bars/eateries louder nightlife.
also ideal sunsets views bali mt agung.
north south quieter.
although popular isn’t overdeveloped highend luxury resort/villa point view limited choice.
if looking private villa aware properties using description “villas” large “bungalow” rooms pool.
purely example  type rooms couple villas.
another example 
be aware “inland” majo basically middle island ~ 1km beach/life.
seminyak
has lots villas need ubud check exact location. bad ubud.
seminyak part large urban tourist sprawl kuta/legian/seminyak. basically area merges next crossing road bar/shop another. legian middle covers 1.5km beach. seminyak closer nightclub area beachwalk mall kuta seminyak square.
there plenty villas close seminyak square.
at south end seminyak/border legian (jalan double six/jalan arjuna) find villas area behind double six luxury hotel.
have check location property carefully find properties calling seminyak 5km inland beach side jalan sunset bypass middle nowhere seminyak canggu.","all the good info above aside ubud - gili t - “down south” is a popular itinerary.
fastboats
easily done with fastboat companies who will include free pickup in ubud and free dropoff “down south” on return.
if you want the best fastboat company then www.bluewater-express.com is widely acknowledged as the best company (we use them for gili t to serangan/“down south”). they are one of the few companies who has services out of padangbai (ideal for ubud) and a “direct” service from gilis to serangan (ideal for “down south”).
ubud
there are lots of villas and highend accommodation available but be very wary of location if you want to be close to town/amenities. always check exact location of any property carefully. never believe any property bumf on location or even go by the name as an indication of location. there is ubud town, ubud district (up to 8km from town in some directions) and “nowhere near ubud but we’ll call ourselves ubud anyway even though it is over 20km/1hr drive to town”. one of the best examples of the worst is “padma ubud”.
gili t
the gili islands are vehicle free. people walk around, cycle or take a donkey/trap.
the islands aren’t that big. you can cycle around gili t in 40minutes.
best if you decide first what part of the island you want to stay and go from there. e.g. east/southeast side is where the fastboats arrive and main party area. we stay in this area at a dive resort ( www.manta-dive.com ) as more interested in diving and snorkeling.
west side has a goodchoice of accommodation and local bars/eateries without the louder nightlife.
also ideal for sunsets with views of bali and mt agung.
north and south quieter.
although popular it isn’t overdeveloped from a highend luxury resort/villa point of view so limited choice.
if looking for a private villa just be aware that some properties using the description “villas” may be just large “bungalow” rooms around a pool.
purely as an example  has these type of rooms but also have a couple of villas.
another example 
be aware that these are more “inland” with majo being basically in the middle of the island ~ 1km from beach/life.
seminyak
has lots of villas but need again like ubud to check exact location. although not as bad as ubud.
seminyak is part of the large urban tourist sprawl of kuta/legian/seminyak. basically one area merges into the next just by crossing the road from 1 bar/shop to another. legian in the middle only covers 1.5km of beach. you can actually be in seminyak and be closer to the nightclub area or beachwalk mall of kuta than seminyak square.
there are plenty of villas close to seminyak square.
at the south end of seminyak/border with legian (jalan double six/jalan arjuna) you will also find villas in the area behind the double six luxury hotel.
have to check location of any property carefully as you can find some properties calling themselves seminyak who are over 5km inland from the beach on the other side of the jalan sunset bypass and also in the middle of nowhere between seminyak and canggu.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g294226-i7220-k13508756-Girls_trip_Where_to_stay-Bali.html,Girls trip!

first to note to avoid any confusion that the kembali villas you listed in post #3 (perhaps it was an auto link) is not kembali beach bungalows in amed.
kembali villas linked in post #3 are in seminyak.
do you dive or just snorkeling.
pemuteran
check exact location of any property carefully. pemuteran spreads out a long way also inland.
pemuteran is mrs pigs favourite after amed.
we stay at 
you have to walk down the beach a little to enter the sea for snorkeling. main reasons is that their are a lot of sea urchins in the sea along with low lying reefs close to shore. there is a signpost.
entry is more or less in front of the pondok sari.
you will also find the biorock reef restoration project.
the only thing is that pemuteran bay is very sandy (just offshore). at full moon/spring tides/windy/choppy seas the sand can get churned up in the bay. even snorkeling close to shore it can be like snorkeling in a milkshake. literally can’t see your hand in front of your face. biorock not visible.
i’ve been diving well offshore and when in shallower water 10-15m on a sunny day it was like diving in a snowglobe with all the glistening sand.
i use the dive centre on the beach behind the swimming pool/wellness massage centre.

they have 2 dive boats. one rib and one larger fibreglass hull boat.
if only snorkeling you can enquire at the dive centre or others along the beach, about snorkeling trips menjangan.
dive trips often willing to take snorkelers if space. advantage is the boat goes from the beach.
you can arrange snorkeling trips locally but this may involve a road trip in a minibus before picking up a local boat.

edited: 10:32 pm, january 02,","i would avoid all the southern beaches at that time of year and head for pemuteran. particularly if you are going to head up to ubud, its only around 4 hours drive from there (traffic dependant) and the drive itself has some great scenery and places to stop. unlike sanur, where the swimming is very tide dependant, its great for swimming at all times of the day, and there is also great basic snorkelling right off the beach. i don't drink (so no expert on the bar scene) but there seem to be lots of lovely beachside places to drink and eat. its definitely laid back and in four visits i've never had to deal with any sarong /massage/hair braiding/nail painting/sunglass selling vendors. no-one goes there to shop, its a more local feel. the hills are lovely and green at that time of the year, and i've never struck a rainy day there in january. it also doesn't get all the rubbish that you find in the south. worth considering as an option.

edited: 8:05 pm, january 05,","you could visit gili t in the middle of your 2 weeks in bali, as it's wise to not leave it to the last part of the trip in case weather/sailing conditions prevent boats leaving on time. do also factor in the time it takes to get there and back and also travel insurance .
i think allocating the remainder of time in ubud and seminyak should suit you well, but i would also consider not staying in a villa. personally, i think it limits the opportunity to meet others and also enjoy the restaurants/cafes that a resort offers.

what is your budget? the dusit is a fantastic hotel if your budget allows and is one of the few hotels with direct beach access and is located on beach road so easy access to shops, bars etc. these days i always stay in soi bukhaoe but that’s because i like to play pool and hotels, bars and restaurants are cheaper in this area (probably not ideal for a first timer). jan and feb are my favourite months so you made a good choice there (providing thailand is open for tourists by then - i have ruled out my jan trip as i’m not sure things will be up and running that soon) . please feel free to message me with any queries or questions. lisa",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g293919-i9439-k13521313-Jomteim_Qs-Pattaya_Chonburi_Province.html,Jomteim Qs,Lisa M,UK,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lisa-Pattaya?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,500,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,80,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,180,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,500,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,80,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,180,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,128000,"[""['pattaya',"", ""'many',"", ""'obviously',"", ""'i’m',"", ""'51',"", ""'old',"", ""'trip',"", ""'thailand',"", ""'pattaya',"", ""'noisy',"", ""'busy',"", ""'pick',"", ""'hua',"", ""'hin',"", ""'big',"", ""'mistake',"", ""'quiet',"", ""'bore',"", ""'dad',"", ""'80',"", ""'2nd',"", ""'time',"", ""'pick',"", ""'pattaya',"", ""'stay',"", ""'avanti',"", ""'ex',"", ""'marriott',"", ""'amaze',"", ""'trip',"", ""'i’m',"", ""'beach',"", ""'person',"", ""'sit',"", ""'swim',"", ""'pool',"", ""'swim',"", ""'sea',"", ""'important',"", ""'pattaya',"", ""'jomtien',"", ""'miss',"", ""'beach',"", ""'sea',"", ""'swim',"", ""'pattaya',"", ""'may',"", ""'walk',"", ""'lot',"", ""'place',"", ""'walk',"", ""'good',"", ""'sightsee',"", ""'pattaya',"", ""'live',"", ""'music',"", ""'many',"", ""'bar',"", ""'live',"", ""'music',"", ""'eat',"", ""'pattaya',"", ""'lot',"", ""'restaurants',"", ""'cheap',"", ""'expensive',"", ""'lot',"", ""'street',"", ""'food',"", ""'pattaya',"", ""'market',"", ""'shop',"", ""'malls',"", ""'day',"", ""'trip',"", ""'stay',"", ""'large',"", ""'resort',"", ""'hotels',"", ""'marriott',"", ""'avani',"", ""'dusit',"", ""'thani',"", ""'tend',"", ""'pick',"", ""'cheaper',"", ""'hotels',"", ""'base',"", ""'travel',"", ""'place',"", ""'stay',"", ""'jomtien',"", ""'week',"", ""'soulless',"", ""'beach',"", ""'good',"", ""'swim',"", ""'nightly',"", ""'entertainment',"", ""'dull',"", ""'limit',"", ""'baht',"", ""'bus',"", ""'bonus',"", ""'pattaya',"", ""'10',"", ""'baht',"", ""'20p',"", ""'convenient',"", ""'cheaply',"", ""'long',"", ""'plan',"", ""'budget',"", ""'dusit',"", ""'fantastic',"", ""'hotel',"", ""'budget',"", ""'allow',"", ""'one',"", ""'hotels',"", ""'direct',"", ""'beach',"", ""'access',"", ""'locate',"", ""'beach',"", ""'road',"", ""'easy',"", ""'access',"", ""'shop',"", ""'bar',"", ""'days',"", ""'stay',"", ""'soi',"", ""'bukhaoe',"", ""'that’s',"", ""'play',"", ""'pool',"", ""'hotels',"", ""'bar',"", ""'restaurants',"", ""'cheaper',"", ""'area',"", ""'ideal',"", ""'timer',"", ""'jan',"", ""'feb',"", ""'favourite',"", ""'months',"", ""'good',"", ""'choice',"", ""'provide',"", ""'thailand',"", ""'open',"", ""'tourists',"", ""'rule',"", ""'jan',"", ""'trip',"", ""'i’m',"", ""'run',"", ""'soon',"", ""'feel',"", ""'free',"", ""'message',"", ""'query',"", ""'question',"", ""'lisa']""]",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

i planning spend time bangkok purpose.i twice don’t need overnights flights.
i add days something must do, close adding much travel time
i loved koh samui read november best time travel there.
i look forward suggestions you. favourite part , planning all. excited.
thank advance expertise experiences.","hello everyone.
sorry this is so long.
i am planning a trip to thailand for the month of november 2022, (surely we will be good to go by then right?). i am so excited just thinking about travelling i want to ask your opinion on my plan.
i am 67 and my husband 72. i have been in various countries in south east asia, and in thailand 3 times. my husband has never been.
so this is the plan so far (open to critique, comments and suggestions)
i will have been in bali for the month of october with a friend and then flying to bangkok to meet up with hubby. overnight at the airport hotel
fly to siem reap for four nights. i have been , husband and friend have not. see the temples, ton le sap lake at sunset and a dance show. anyone recommend a good show?
looking for a mid range hotel with a pool walking distance to the market etc if you have a favourite.
from there fly to chaing mai for six nights . again i have been, others have not. we want to go to an elephant sanctuary (any recommendations?) a cooking class and sightsee lots of temples.
perhaps a trip up to chaing rai, (is it worth it? haven’t been) perhaps add another day to overnight there?
the yee peng lantern festival will be happening so thinking of going to the university for the first night to see it, and looking for recommendations for a roof top restaurant /bar for the second night.
any hints on chaing mai would be appreciated. i will want to stay in the old city.
i will also get another thai silk jacket made if i can. i had one made there 15 years ago and it was amazing. i lost too much weight to wear it any more. which is good and bad. anyone recommend a good reasonable tailor who has actual thai silk . i had one made in vietnam a couple years ago but it was a silk polyester blend i think and not the same.
my friend will go home at this point and husband and i will maybe head to khao sok for four nights, thinking of jungle house.
is that too much time, not enough? i read of another place where the cabins are on the water and you can kayak right off them but cant find that. any one know what it is called?
would i want to stay a couple of nights at each place?
will it be really hot, muggy and buggy there in november? my husband does not do well with extreme mugginess and heat.
then the beach!! phi phi for 8 nights to relax, read, swim and snorkel. i stayed at phi phi relax last time, this time though i think i will stay in one of their beachfront cabins so as to avoid all of those stairs.
or open to any other recommendations of similar places. we like to walk out the door and swim in the ocean.
then railay beach for 5 nights . i cant believe how much the prices have gone up since i was there 4 years ago! thinking of railay village resort but open to suggestions. last time we stayed at sand sea but the price has gone up so much.
i am not planning to spend any time in bangkok on purpose.i have been twice before and don’t need to go back other than overnights for flights.
i can add a few more days if you think there is something else that is a must do, close to where we will be so not adding too much travel time
i loved koh samui but from what i have read november is not the best time to travel there.
i look forward to any suggestions from you. this is my favourite part , the planning of it all. i am so excited.

there are plenty of good restaurants in wareham and you could look at boat trips from swanage or, hire a canoe and venture up the river.
if you do opt for weymouth, look to stay near the harbour and either way, book as soon as you can because many places are already fully booked throughout september! hope you enjoy",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g186261-i406-k13584512-Wareham_or_Weymouth-Dorset_England.html,Wareham or Weymouth,Linda M,"Croydon, United...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lindaanne186338?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,50,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,50,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,200,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,200,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,50,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,50,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,50.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,52500,"[""['recommend',"", ""'wareham',"", ""'walk',"", ""'swanage',"", ""'beach',"", ""'road',"", ""'steam',"", ""'train',"", ""'corfe',"", ""'one',"", ""'favourite',"", ""'circular',"", ""'walk',"", ""'scot',"", ""'arm',"", ""'kingston',"", ""'walk',"", ""'tree',"", ""'begin',"", ""'open',"", ""'sunshine',"", ""'coast',"", ""'round',"", ""'different',"", ""'path',"", ""'pub',"", ""'lunch',"", ""'garden',"", ""'view',"", ""'plenty',"", ""'good',"", ""'restaurants',"", ""'wareham',"", ""'boat',"", ""'trip',"", ""'swanage',"", ""'hire',"", ""'canoe',"", ""'venture',"", ""'river',"", ""'opt',"", ""'weymouth',"", ""'stay',"", ""'near',"", ""'harbour',"", ""'way',"", ""'book',"", ""'soon',"", ""'many',"", ""'place',"", ""'fully',"", ""'book',"", ""'throughout',"", ""'september']""]",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

why interest seminyak? i’m personally fan kuta prefer seminyak. metered taxis plentiful economical visit seminyak kuta want wander around. favourite sanur. sanur half hour boat trip across island nusa lembongan/nusa penida you’re interested water activities (not necessarily diving snorkelling) stay days.
think nights gili long. me, ubud deserves longer stay nights (2 full days) plenty see ubud town good base sightseeing cultural sites/experiences afield. could walk campuhan ridge ubud. you’ve stated “replanning” you’ve done research chosen areas. perhaps read pinned posts top forum “the different areas bali.....”.
the weather less wet according crystal ball tell hot humid. june lovely time visit. july/august/september popular time room rates higher busy.
eating bali excellent. many, many cafes/restaurants/local warungs cuisines prices suit budgets.
these comments pre covid.","hi, personally i’d go to ubud first, then gili t, then kuta. kuta being closer to the airport for your departure flight.
why your interest in seminyak? i’m personally not a fan of kuta and prefer seminyak. metered taxis are plentiful and economical for you to visit seminyak from kuta if you want to have a wander around. and my other favourite is sanur. from sanur you can go for a half hour boat trip across to the island of nusa lembongan/nusa penida if you’re interested in water activities (not necessarily diving but maybe snorkelling) and stay for a few days.
think 6 nights on gili t too long. for me, ubud deserves a longer stay than 3 nights (2 full days) as there is plenty to see and do in ubud town and a good base for sightseeing cultural sites/experiences further afield. you could walk the campuhan ridge in ubud. as you’ve stated your “replanning” it would suggest you’ve already done the research of your chosen areas. perhaps have another read of the pinned posts at the top of the forum “the different areas of bali.....”.
the weather will be less wet according to my crystal ball but i can tell you it will be very hot and humid. june is a lovely time to visit. july/august/september is the most popular time but room rates are higher and very busy.

ok passing rapidly rather visiting singapore big way. makes easier settle big see fillers backup bad weather - hard part narrowing down. best idea pick attracts most.",">>you are right, i should post this on the appropriate country's forums <<
you will get a wider and more detailed range of replies most likely.
you should get some useful ones here - enough of those who live in singapore or those of us who visit will have gone to these places to get you some ideas and these hub questions crop up enough the basics are here....plus there are those who post her who are des in the areas you are looking at so can provide the detailed stuff, but the more answers the better in my view!
narrowing down will help as while every forum has subforums, here they are essentially pointless whereas in the malaysian forums they do help with local specifics.
>>yes, we are going to spend a couple of nights in singapore for sure<<
ok so you'll be passing rapidly rather than visiting singapore in any big way. that makes things easier because you probably only have to settle on one big thing to see and maybe some fillers and a backup for bad weather - the hard part there is doing the narrowing down. the best idea is just to pick what attracts most.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g294265-i1748-k13623295-Malaysia_Indonesia_Itinerary-Singapore.html,Malaysia/Indonesia Itinerary,Myrm,Asia,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/myrm?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,100,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,10000,"[""['right',"", ""'post',"", ""'appropriate',"", ""'countrys',"", ""'forums',"", ""'wider',"", ""'detail',"", ""'range',"", ""'reply',"", ""'useful',"", ""'ones',"", ""'live',"", ""'singapore',"", ""'visit',"", ""'place',"", ""'ideas',"", ""'hub',"", ""'question',"", ""'crop',"", ""'basics',"", ""'hereplus',"", ""'post',"", ""'des',"", ""'areas',"", ""'provide',"", ""'detail',"", ""'stuff',"", ""'view',"", ""'narrow',"", ""'help',"", ""'forum',"", ""'subforums',"", ""'essentially',"", ""'pointless',"", ""'whereas',"", ""'malaysian',"", ""'forums',"", ""'help',"", ""'local',"", ""'specifics',"", ""'spend',"", ""'couple',"", ""'nights',"", ""'singapore',"", ""'pass',"", ""'rapidly',"", ""'visit',"", ""'singapore',"", ""'big',"", ""'way',"", ""'easier',"", ""'settle',"", ""'one',"", ""'big',"", ""'see',"", ""'fillers',"", ""'backup',"", ""'bad',"", ""'weather',"", ""'hard',"", ""'part',"", ""'narrow',"", ""'idea',"", ""'pick',"", ""'attract']""]",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

with iceland and i would therefore suspect israel, the reference to single vaccination shots relates to the vaccine make that only needs one shot. it requires full vaccination to be in place...and given the inserts all say x time post vaccination for efficacy you may well run into places enforcing that wait as part of the 'fully vaccinated' description. so unless you can do that you need to look at those that will accept negative testing.
>>well back to the topic in hand....i did do research on couch surfing in singapore, is that worth it?<<
probably not unless you have been a member of that community for a decent length of time.
here's the problem - its illegal to let residential space (in part or in who) out to rent for any consideration (in cash or in kind) for periods of less three months in singapore.
now you are permitted to host family and friends you have connections to for free legally within limits.
couchsurfing as it started being popular in the 90s was a network of backpacking friends who knew each other or were friends of friends and used the internet to connect. a backpacking variation of the 80s boom in international vacation home-swaps as it were. now such sites have become so big that connection and community side of the whole couch surfing thing is pretty much the minority and people use it as a cheap/free crashing option.
if you were staying with someone you have some connection with for free then its legal - as soon as their is no connection or there is any consideration (even be it host rating/site rating on a couch surf network that the person can use to improve their ability to couch surf then you are effectively on a cheap rental.
even if you fall into the community couchsurfer definition (ie where it could be legal) there are still potential issues especially in hdb buildings. if someone has couchsurfers over enough that they cause a perceived nuisance to the other residents then it can be shut down just on that basis(leaving you with no place to stay, potentially at the point you turn up).
the government has ramped up cutting down on illegal letting and associated nuisance, which covers such sites a vrbo, airbnb and so on's bread and butter type of lets. couchsurfing has more potential to be legal but if a surf host is swept up in a nuisance sweep its not help to those staying and for many there is little difference as a tourist surfing is still operating on tourist timings so being non-residential in nature - thats one of the points raised in the public consultation on short term renting in residential areas.
so you have to be very very careful on exactly what you are doing with couch surfing to stay legal and also not be a nuisance.
also on a practical side, most couch surfing is done in suburban areas a long way from tourist sites. you would in many cases do better to look at a good cheap hostel or pod type hotel where costs are much lower than big city centre hotels but you have a) a guaranteed legal stay, b) access to the community from which couch surfing sprang, c) more personal and legal safety and d) potentially better access to singapore's sights.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g294262-i1747-k13543281-Possibly_might_travel_alone_to_Singapore_need_help_please-Singapore.html,"Possibly might travel

four nights is a bit of a whistlestop trip. you will get a taste of singapore, so see a few major items. it isnt enough for singapore as a destination but as a stopover from nz will let you try bits out in the three full days you would have. do enough planning and you’ll get a plan to enjoy the place...just do not try or think that you can do all the major sites in that time and that releases you to just pick and do what you most want to do letting you enjoy it without trying to hard to cram.

however the typical cloudbursts last an hour and go so do not cause too much trouble typically..and that assumes the rain hits where you are and when you are in the open. many the time i have returned to the city to see it sodden while having had glorious sun out west. the thing is that with a short visit, you are snapshotting the weather and in dry or wet months (which frankly are a relative thing to the average european visitor) and so have to consider any singapore weather form at any time of the year, the seasonal differences are acutely noticeable to a resident, less so to a visitor.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g294265-i1748-k13468030-Singapore_short_stay-Singapore.html,Singapore short stay,Myrm,UK,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/myrm?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,200,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,200,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,40000,"[""['entirely',"", ""'combine',"", ""'city',"", ""'sentosa',"", ""'sentosa',"", ""'district',"", ""'singapore',"", ""'right',"", ""'southern',"", ""'part',"", ""'city',"", ""'quicker',"", ""'northern',"", ""'part',"", ""'isnt',"", ""'hugely',"", ""'separated15mins',"", ""'taxi',"", ""'marina',"", ""'area',"", ""'mrt',"", ""'chinatown',"", ""'four',"", ""'nights',"", ""'whistlestop',"", ""'trip',"", ""'taste',"", ""'singapore',"", ""'see',"", ""'major',"", ""'items',"", ""'isnt',"", ""'singapore',"", ""'destination',"", ""'stopover',"", ""'nz',"", ""'try',"", ""'bits',"", ""'three',"", ""'full',"", ""'days',"", ""'plan',"", ""'you’ll',"", ""'plan',"", ""'placejust',"", ""'try',"", ""'major',"", ""'sit',"", ""'time',"", ""'release',"", ""'pick',"", ""'try',"", ""'hard',"", ""'cram',"", ""'weather',"", ""'pretty',"", ""'much',"", ""'round',"", ""'tropical',"", ""'heat',"", ""'humidity',"", ""'cloudburst',"", ""'type',"", ""'rain',"", ""'rain',"", ""'variable',"", ""'january',"", ""'tail',"", ""'end',"", ""'wet',"", ""'seasonwhich',"", ""'rain',"", ""'hit',"", ""'average',"", ""'day',"", ""'three',"", ""'days',"", ""'driest',"", ""'months',"", ""'full',"", ""'day',"", ""'rain',"", ""'require',"", ""'activate',"", ""'backup',"", ""'typical',"", ""'cloudbursts',"", ""'hour',"", ""'cause',"", ""'much',"", ""'trouble',"", ""'typicallyand',"", ""'assume',"", ""'rain',"", ""'hit',"", ""'open',"", ""'many',"", ""'time',"", ""'city',"", ""'see',"", ""'sodden',"", ""'glorious',"", ""'sun',"", ""'west',"", ""'short',"", ""'visit',"", ""'snapshotting',"", ""'weather',"", ""'dry',"", ""'wet',"", ""'months',"", ""'frankly',"", ""'relative',"", ""'average',"", ""'european',"", ""'visitor',"", ""'singapore',"", ""'weather',"", ""'form',"", ""'time',"", ""'seasonal',"", ""'differences',"", ""'acutely',"", ""'noticeable',"", ""'resident',"", ""'less',"", ""'visitor']""]",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

ok - i slightly misread that - 4 days in uk travel agent speak usually means day 1 arrive which will have restrictions on it, day 2 and 3 are full unrestricted days, and day 4 will include travel (either home or to bangkok) and so have restrictions.
this is really short and so most planning will be of the sort of 'what do we cut out from the list of options'
it is worth deciding ahead of time what you plan to do - ensuring you have enough knowledge to hand that you can easily pull out a filler (for if you take much less time than expected somewhere, or get there and simply not enjoy it), or to do a swap for bad weather affecting a choice of attraction. while long days full of rain are not common, with such a short snapshot at the point you get unlucky and get one its a sizeable block of time affected.
your flight times and routing in and out of singapore will heavily affect the days of travel and what is possible - so if you want planning help those are really vital to know - for the uk legs is it direct, or bouncing on the way and what time does it arrive, and for a more local flight (bangkok or koh samui) is that in or outbound and when. while you can sort of double your time in singapore there are issues in terms of what is suitable to see for say a first day with an early morning landing direct from the uk for example.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g294265-i1748-k13508495-Choice_of_2_hotels_which_is_the_best_location-Singapore.html,"Choice of 2 hotels, which is the best location?",Myrm,UK,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/myrm?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,100,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,100,0,100,0,0.0,0.0,0,100,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,40000,"[""['spend',"", ""'4',"", ""'days',"", ""'singapore',"", ""'3',"", ""'days',"", ""'bangkok',"", ""'8',"", ""'days',"", ""'koh',"", ""'samui',"", ""'slightly',"", ""'misread',"", ""'4',"", ""'days',"", ""'uk',"", ""'travel',"", ""'agent',"", ""'speak',"", ""'day',"", ""'1',"", ""'arrive',"", ""'restrictions',"", ""'day',"", ""'2',"", ""'3',"", ""'full',"", ""'unrestricted',"", ""'days',"", ""'day',"", ""'4',"", ""'include',"", ""'travel',"", ""'home',"", ""'bangkok',"", ""'restrictions',"", ""'short',"", ""'plan',"", ""'sort',"", ""'cut',"", ""'options',"", ""'worth',"", ""'ahead',"", ""'time',"", ""'plan',"", ""'ensure',"", ""'knowledge',"", ""'hand',"", ""'easily',"", ""'pull',"", ""'filler',"", ""'much',"", ""'less',"", ""'time',"", ""'expect',"", ""'simply',"", ""'swap',"", ""'bad',"", ""'weather',"", ""'affect',"", ""'choice',"", ""'attraction',"", ""'long',"", ""'days',"", ""'full',"", ""'rain',"", ""'common',"", ""'short',"", ""'snapshot',"", ""'point',"", ""'unlucky',"", ""'one',"", ""'sizeable',"", ""'block',"", ""'time',"", ""'affect',"", ""'flight',"", ""'time',"", ""'rout',"", ""'singapore',"", ""'heavily',"", ""'affect',"", ""'days',"", ""'travel',"", ""'plan',"", ""'help',"", ""'vital',"", ""'uk',"", ""'legs',"", ""'direct',"", ""'bounce',"", ""'way',"", ""'time',"", ""'arrive',"", ""'local',"", ""'flight',"", ""'bangkok',"", ""'koh',"", ""'samui',"", ""'outbound',"", ""'sort',"", ""'double',"", ""'time',"", ""'singapore',"", ""'term',"", ""'suitable',"", ""'see',"", ""'day',"", ""'early',"", ""'morning',"", ""'land',"", ""'direct',"", ""'uk',"", ""'example']""]",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

hotel snow, cavan road, lavender (about 7 minutes walk from lavender mrt station) has updated their very small rooms to make them fresh, modern and functional.
some may find the tiny rooms basic and claustrophobic (some don’t have windows) and the bathroom is a tiny wet room with shower head over the toilet area so that may not suit some people, but i stayed 4 times and found the location excellent on a quiet narrow road off lavender street.
prices looked higher than i remembered, but with the reno/update it’s still a good small option for a night or two and i will definitely stay again...when i eventually get back to singapore.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g294262-i1747-k12945730-Hotel_News_and_Updates_Singapore_and_Sentosa-Singapore.html,Hotel News and Updates - Singapore and Sentosa,Avanti_SG,AU,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Avanti_SG?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,50,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,50,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,200,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,50,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,50.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,200,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,50000,"[""['notice',"", ""'book',"", ""'site',"", ""'expedia',"", ""'one',"", ""'favourite',"", ""'little',"", ""'budget',"", ""'hotels',"", ""'renovation',"", ""'room',"", ""'foyer',"", ""'hotel',"", ""'snow',"", ""'cavan',"", ""'road',"", ""'lavender',"", ""'7',"", ""'minutes',"", ""'walk',"", ""'lavender',"", ""'mrt',"", ""'station',"", ""'update',"", ""'small',"", ""'room',"", ""'fresh',"", ""'modern',"", ""'functional',"", ""'may',"", ""'tiny',"", ""'room',"", ""'basic',"", ""'claustrophobic',"", ""'don’t',"", ""'windows',"", ""'bathroom',"", ""'tiny',"", ""'wet',"", ""'room',"", ""'shower',"", ""'head',"", ""'toilet',"", ""'area',"", ""'may',"", ""'suit',"", ""'people',"", ""'stay',"", ""'4',"", ""'time',"", ""'location',"", ""'excellent',"", ""'quiet',"", ""'narrow',"", ""'road',"", ""'lavender',"", ""'street',"", ""'price',"", ""'higher',"", ""'reno',"", ""'update',"", ""'it’s',"", ""'good',"", ""'small',"", ""'night',"", ""'two',"", ""'stay',"", ""'againwhen',"", ""'eventually',"", ""'singapore']""]",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
70,2567,SG,"thanks bill, that's useful information.
i've completely randomly picked travel date, main reason summer melbourne, handle cold clear weather winter solstice spring. hate heading winter melbourne, daylight hours fewer etc. retired that's time year we'd head northern hemisphere.
if bubble gets sooner, wasting opportunity, believe dec/jan challenging humidity front.

i've completely randomly picked may as a travel date, main reason being i like summer in melbourne, can handle the cold but clear weather after the winter solstice and spring. what i hate is heading in to winter in melbourne, the daylight hours being fewer etc. since we retired that's the time of year we'd head to the northern hemisphere.
if a bubble gets up sooner, i won't be wasting the opportunity, although i believe dec/jan is a bit more challenging on the humidity front.

thank you again for taking the time to reassure people",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g295424-i872-k13464244-Just_returned_from_Dubai_report-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html,Just returned from Dubai report,danielle c,UK,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/daniellenkaela?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,100,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,100,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,20000,"[""['report',"", ""'similar',"", ""'travel',"", ""'london',"", ""'due',"", ""'head',"", ""'dubai',"", ""'friday',"", ""'plan',"", ""'test',"", ""'arrival',"", ""'monday',"", ""'nhs',"", ""'one',"", ""'case',"", ""'time',"", ""'nhs',"", ""'service',"", ""'test',"", ""'4',"", ""'days',"", ""'overly',"", ""'hopeful',"", ""'glad',"", ""'experience',"", ""'time',"", ""'away',"", ""'safely',"", ""'question',"", ""'weather',"", ""'dire',"", ""'time',"", ""'reassure',"", ""'people']""]",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

in general i think this is too much travel, too many separate destinations, for only 8 weeks. plus some of your routes are not directly serviced, not only as pointed out by michael but also hcmc to samui.
also bear in mind that june/july is the wet season in several of the places you mention in particular penang although it is an excellent time weather wise to visit bali.
i would cut out malaysia (potentially rainy) and singapore (expensive) and allocate at least two full weeks to properly explore bali in what would likely be beautiful weather at that time.

""rental prices have fallen and this has allowed locals to repossess their island and reopen businesses at reasonable prices""
i've been many times to koh tao (numerous times a year in fact) and have noticed the exact opposite - the majority of places still open were foreign owned, and lots of my cheap little thai places have closed down. thank f. the duck place in sairee is still open!
however there are now many options on fb food groups for very cheap food from people working out of their home kitchens, it seems.
lots of dive schools appear to have closed, with the larger ones still running - asia divers, sairee cottage, mojo, dpm and puravida all closed when i went past. the diving has been great though,the corals in excellent condition due to less people trampling on them too. the empty dive sites a great bonus for those lucky enough to be on the island!
hope the locals can survive this pandemic...",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g303910-i9415-k13464630-Business_permanently_closed-Koh_Tao_Surat_Thani_Province.html,Business permanently closed,feedpony,CA,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/feedpony?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,100,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,100,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,100.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,100,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,400.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,60000,"[""['dether',"", ""'disagree',"", ""'comment',"", ""'rental',"", ""'price',"", ""'fall',"", ""'allow',"", ""'locals',"", ""'repossess',"", ""'island',"", ""'reopen',"", ""'businesses',"", ""'reasonable',"", ""'price',"", ""'many',"", ""'time',"", ""'koh',"", ""'tao',"", ""'numerous',"", ""'time',"", ""'fact',"", ""'notice',"", ""'exact',"", ""'opposite',"", ""'majority',"", ""'place',"", ""'open',"", ""'foreign',"", ""'lot',"", ""'cheap',"", ""'little',"", ""'thai',"", ""'place',"", ""'close',"", ""'f',"", ""'duck',"", ""'place',"", ""'sairee',"", ""'open',"", ""'many',"", ""'options',"", ""'fb',"", ""'food',"", ""'group',"", ""'cheap',"", ""'food',"", ""'people',"", ""'work',"", ""'home',"", ""'kitchens',"", ""'lot',"", ""'dive',"", ""'school',"", ""'appear',"", ""'close',"", ""'larger',"", ""'ones',"", ""'run',"", ""'asia',"", ""'divers',"", ""'sairee',"", ""'cottage',"", ""'mojo',"", ""'dpm',"", ""'puravida',"", ""'close',"", ""'past',"", ""'dive',"", ""'thoughthe',"", ""'corals',"", ""'excellent',"", ""'due',"", ""'less',"", ""'people',"", ""'trample',"", ""'empty',"", ""'dive',"", ""'sit',"", ""'bonus',"", ""'lucky',"", ""'island',"", ""'locals',"", ""'survive',"", ""'pandemic']""]",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

i'm scheduled to go on g adventure's indochina encompassed trip 9/27-10/26. however, i just heard that there's been a prolonged spike of covid in thailand so i'm starting to worry what to do if the trip is cancelled. the trip also visits laos, vietnam, and cambodia.
how likely is it that the trip will be cancelled? should i start planning for backup vacations in places like europe and africa?

as things stand now, the chances that this trip will go ahead are slim to none.
""on the other hand, if i get a full refund i can use that to spend on a non-g adventure trip in the us.""
if you are able to get a full refund if you decide to cancel, then that would be the way to go especially when the trip involves 4 different countries.
""should i start planning for backup vacations in places like europe and africa?""
the eu and the us are working on a plan to facilitate entry of american tourists in the eu. stay tuned.

* any city you have an interest in will have information available at the top of the particular forum.
""myself and my wife are travelling with another couple.. 11.3.22 _to 26.3.22""
if you mean march, and you actually intend to go in the water, then choose a beach location with good weather for march. (google and forum search.)
""finish off with some high end resort break for 2 or 3 days...""
do you intend to actually swim at a beach or just watch the water and use the hotel pool? how far will you go from bangkok? there are beach areas you can drive to (or have someone drive you) not that far from bangkok.
if march next year you have a lot of time for research.
look up nakhon ratchasima forum. nearby is the town of phimai, just a short bus ride away.

if your departure flight is from bangkok my advice is to finish there with a night or two. this way you can buy your tourist junk and be a simple train or taxi ride to the airport.
good luck.

since we’re gonna quite long thailand tourists, much time need fill in. ideas advice regarding travel plan love hear it.","hi everyone,
soon i am traveling to thailand with my boyfriend (in may until half august). first we will go in quarantaine of course and after that we have 10 full weeks to spend in beautiful thailand.
after quarantaine we’ll spend time in bangkok and then go to ubon ratchathani (my family lives there). after that we still have no plans.
i’ve only been to chiang mai and phuket before and my boyfriend has never been to thailand. so it’ll be nice to see the highlights. we’re ready to explore a lot but not hop from place to place too quick.
we would like to explore city life, do cultural stuff, join tours, hiking & sport activities (easy level) and relax a lot (beach / swimming).
we don’t want to go to too remote places (and stay in areas with good hospitals). we want to go to chiang mai and southern beaches for sure and travel through the country preferrably by plane.
also i wonder if some cities/areas that are normally touristic would be worth it to visit now in covid times (it could be too abandoned).
korat is near ubon, would this be nice to visit?
since we’re gonna be quite long in thailand as tourists, there is much time that we need to fill in. if you have ideas and an advice regarding our travel plan i would love to hear it.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g293915-i3686-k13504676-Advice_Travel_Itinerary_Thailand_10_weeks-Thailand.html,Advice Travel Itinerary Thailand 10 weeks,Emma D,"Den Bosch, The...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/K7495JVemmad?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,50,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,50,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,50,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,50,0,0,0,200,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,30000,"[""['soon',"", ""'travel',"", ""'thailand',"", ""'boyfriend',"", ""'may',"", ""'half',"", ""'august',"", ""'quarantaine',"", ""'course',"", ""'10',"", ""'full',"", ""'weeks',"", ""'spend',"", ""'beautiful',"", ""'thailand',"", ""'quarantaine',"", ""'we’ll',"", ""'spend',"", ""'time',"", ""'bangkok',"", ""'ubon',"", ""'ratchathani',"", ""'family',"", ""'live',"", ""'plan',"", ""'i’ve',"", ""'chiang',"", ""'mai',"", ""'phuket',"", ""'boyfriend',"", ""'thailand',"", ""'it’ll',"", ""'see',"", ""'highlight',"", ""'we’re',"", ""'ready',"", ""'explore',"", ""'lot',"", ""'hop',"", ""'place',"", ""'place',"", ""'quick',"", ""'explore',"", ""'city',"", ""'life',"", ""'cultural',"", ""'stuff',"", ""'join',"", ""'tour',"", ""'hike',"", ""'sport',"", ""'activities',"", ""'easy',"", ""'level',"", ""'relax',"", ""'lot',"", ""'beach',"", ""'swim',"", ""'don’t',"", ""'remote',"", ""'place',"", ""'stay',"", ""'areas',"", ""'good',"", ""'hospitals',"", ""'chiang',"", ""'mai',"", ""'southern',"", ""'beach',"", ""'travel',"", ""'country',"", ""'preferrably',"", ""'plane',"", ""'wonder',"", ""'cities',"", ""'areas',"", ""'normally',"", ""'touristic',"", ""'worth',"", ""'visit',"", ""'covid',"", ""'time',"", ""'abandon',"", ""'korat',"", ""'near',"", ""'ubon',"", ""'visit',"", ""'we’re',"", ""'gonna',"", ""'quite',"", ""'long',"", ""'thailand',"", ""'tourists',"", ""'much',"", ""'time',"", ""'fill',"", ""'ideas',"", ""'advice',"", ""'travel',"", ""'plan',"", ""'hear']""]",False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

options abound.","knowing your interests would help...maybe. history (thai / khmer) then you're in the right place for that, the ne. two of the better restored sites, phimai & phanom rung. korat city itself is nothing special, especially since you'll be spending a bit of time in ubon. thai culture is everywhere, and no need to travel for it, simply open your mind where you are.
close by, sort of and along the mekong can be nice, that phanom & nakhon phanom, though more a self drive kind of thing. ne can be a bit boring on the korat plateau, but the edges of have some lovely landscape.
monsoon / raining season, so most of the country is going to be wet at times, sunny at times, actually my favorite time of year, since very lush & green, except when wanting to play in the surf, as that can be very rough / dangerous. also may affect any ferry traffic to islands, for comfort, all the to being cancelled.
if you've only been to cm & phuket during smog season, then you'll really enjoy the views in rainy season, when sunny out. so may want to think about a revisit there. instead of almost seeing that 1 ridge through the smog, you'll see the 5 or 10 behind it. goes for all of the upper north side, and along myanmar border mountain range.
check weather and sea conditions, before heading to anywhere in the gulf, maybe a better bet for actually swimming in the seas. you state flying, but train runs down the gulf coast, if not wanting to self drive, and can be very convenient for visiting all that is along there. get near chumphon & surat thani, and you can think about hopping over to ko tao or samui.
i would definitely hit the khao sok np area, and cheow lan lake, more just the lake, as spectacular landscape, and hopefully sunny day for boat tour & hotel stay on the lake for swimming. no worries about rough seas there. can't think of a better place to get your nature freak on.
side trips out of krung thep (bangkok) to all the normal touristy stuff, since none here, and they're great now, as been out & about ourselves, on & off since june 2020.

same with latest outbreak, and traveled through samut sakhon and about the 'red zones' of krung thep area, and again, no problems.
i thinking about popping back down to phuket, before the surf gets rough. that was spectacular. as richard stated, hasn't been that nice since just after the tsunami.

for hotel recommendations you need to give your nightly budget in thai baht. with two adult sons presumably you will need at least two separate rooms.
christmas is a great time to visit thailand from a weather viewpoint.

october is usually decent for phuket, weather & surf wise. if not this year, then next. just don't pay for anything in advance.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g293920-i5037-k13464914-The_Marina_Hotel_vs_The_Senses_resort_and_villa-Phuket.html,The Marina Hotel vs The Senses resort and villa?,Life's a Beach ⛱,0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/UP2UorNot?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,100,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,100,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,100,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,30000,"[""['touristy',"", ""'areas',"", ""'phuket',"", ""'normally',"", ""'mute',"", ""'subject',"", ""'doubtful',"", ""'oct',"", ""'open',"", ""'quarantine',"", ""'plan',"", ""'book',"", ""'site',"", ""'bookingcom',"", ""'filter',"", ""'budget',"", ""'beach',"", ""'amenities',"", ""'youd',"", ""'pick',"", ""'cross',"", ""'reference',"", ""'location',"", ""'nearby',"", ""'google',"", ""'map',"", ""'october',"", ""'decent',"", ""'phuket',"", ""'weather',"", ""'surf',"", ""'wise',"", ""'pay',"", ""'advance']""]",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

i assume the complete suspension is just the last 2-3 weeks then ?, the current lockdown won't last til october 2021 i think/hope.
from what i've read over the last 10 years on here, the big ferrys to phi phi rarely get cancelled due to bad weather, and 2 nights on phi phi would be better than 1 anyway.
i wouldn't worry about getting stranded on phi phi, if there were huge storms arriving at that time, the weather forecast/news would be mentioning them, they wouldn't appear with no warning at all

you probably will get some nice weather, i'm sure it won't rain or be cloudy all the time. some people also like to go in low season, as its quieter & cheaper",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g1215780-i12697-k13546510-A_night_away-Karon_Phuket.html,A night away,jaynewcastle11,UK,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jaynewcastle11?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,100,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,10000,"[""['weather',"", ""'website',"", ""'accuweather',"", ""'see',"", ""'weather',"", ""'previous',"", ""'obviously',"", ""'guarantee',"", ""'weather',"", ""'future',"", ""'jan',"", ""'feb',"", ""'may',"", ""'june',"", ""'interest',"", ""'rainy',"", ""'season',"", ""'home',"", ""'weather',"", ""'rain',"", ""'cloudy',"", ""'time',"", ""'people',"", ""'low',"", ""'season',"", ""'quieter',"", ""'cheaper']""]",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

sorry can't help regarding what's open business moment, i've away while. check phuket community discussion page  - users living i'm sure could help assist well. best luck journey time there!","hope you like it emily, phuket is a great place to live. i'll be moving back pretty soon as well. chalong is the area just south of phuket town (quite charming), with beaches facing east. the better beaches in general are on the west side of the island, though i'm not sure exactly what's preferred for surfing. it's not too far a ride to get over the mountains to kata or karon beaches (or patong/kamala beaches if you're further north in chalong).
they have buses, or sometimes big encaged trucks that have a few routes around the island. i've not taken them, but i imagine they go on a fairly regular schedule. otherwise grab is a good way to book a quick ride, even a motorcycle taxi if you're not going far or want to avoid traffic.
sorry can't be of more help regarding what's open for business at the moment, i've been away for a while. but you can also check on the phuket community discussion page here  - there are users living there who i'm sure could help assist as well. best of luck in your journey and time there!",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g293920-i5037-k13571405-Moving_to_Chalong-Phuket.html,Moving to Chalong,paulieweb,Phuket Town...,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paulieweb?tab=forum,0,0,0,50,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,50,0.0,0,50,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,200,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,50,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,50,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,32500,"[""['emily',"", ""'phuket',"", ""'place',"", ""'live',"", ""'ill',"", ""'move',"", ""'pretty',"", ""'soon',"", ""'chalong',"", ""'area',"", ""'south',"", ""'phuket',"", ""'town',"", ""'quite',"", ""'charm',"", ""'beach',"", ""'face',"", ""'east',"", ""'beach',"", ""'general',"", ""'west',"", ""'side',"", ""'island',"", ""'exactly',"", ""'prefer',"", ""'surf',"", ""'far',"", ""'ride',"", ""'mountains',"", ""'kata',"", ""'karon',"", ""'beach',"", ""'patong',"", ""'kamala',"", ""'beach',"", ""'north',"", ""'chalong',"", ""'bus',"", ""'big',"", ""'encaged',"", ""'truck',"", ""'rout',"", ""'island',"", ""'imagine',"", ""'fairly',"", ""'regular',"", ""'schedule',"", ""'grab',"", ""'good',"", ""'way',"", ""'book',"", ""'quick',"", ""'ride',"", ""'motorcycle',"", ""'taxi',"", ""'far',"", ""'avoid',"", ""'traffic',"", ""'sorry',"", ""'help',"", ""'open',"", ""'business',"", ""'moment',"", ""'away',"", ""'phuket',"", ""'community',"", ""'discussion',"", ""'page',"", ""'users',"", ""'live',"", ""'help',"", ""'assist',"", ""'journey',"", ""'time']""]",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

i am planning on traveling to srinagar from bombay in the next week or so for 1-2 weeks(flexible). i plan on spending a couple days in srinagar and taking trips to nearby places.
first one is pahalgam, and i was wondering how many days i should stay there for?
i was also thinking of visiting yusmarg and gulmarg, but i’m not sure if i should make a day trip or spend the night in those areas. i’d prefer to make a day trip as i can have access to nice food, hotels, and gyms in srinagar.
in addition to those places, are there any other places you’d recommend visiting in early-mid april? i really love the green scenery with some snow, just like the views you get on the zojila pass in june. i’m not too much into only snowy areas.
do you guys think i should skip sonamarg if i drove by it last time and saw the scenery over there on the way to ladakh, or is there a lot to do there?
also, would gulmarg have only snowy views at this time of year or will there be a lot of greenery?

my reply normal conditions,not considering covid19 lockdown/restrictions ,you check trip covid regulations.
1st looks priority sight seeing budget, believe going worst time year per priority.
1> yes too,you check railway retiring room booking available,there basic lodge/hotel infront njp also,not good option save hassle traveling siliguri night.
2>bus much time share cab budget priority go.
3>very less chance north sikkim nathula accessible,hope best.
4>no bus,you share cab ghezing or/and jorangthan,
5>ok
6>don't find reason stay near batasia loop infact splitting stay, staying single place better.
7>certainly walking distance,it's 15 km plus rains last phase bad roads difficult walk raining,take share cab,also july visiting morning sunrise wasting time money,you find clouds.even days mostly cloudy.
8> easily,get share cab morning reach njp well time.but case visit tiger hill sunrise total wastage money time suggested earlier.
//and apply required permits 1st day//
you apply, travel agent apply.//
//along nathula pass permit (gangtok - zuluk - nathula pass - changu - gangtok). hoping could shared cab round trip.//
dzuluk single day trip,you gangtok tsongo nathula back,share trip available 700-800 rs,but monsoon arrives full fledged nathula possible,even tsongo doubtful.
//then start lachung 4th day (sunday) public/shared transport, homestay lachung days. (pre-booking done guess read homestays booked via tourism packages)//
again weather dependent,less chance exactly predict.share package available 3.5-4 k includes fooding, lodging, transport permit days night to/from gangtok.
//so, manage 14k sikkim days? pre-booking not? worry hike price pre-booking//
if prebooking certainly going pay ,in july tourist sikkim, hotels vacant,taxi drivers travel agent searching tourist,can certainly deals spot.","@jeevan patnaiak
my reply is for normal conditions,not considering covid19 lockdown/restrictions ,you have to check before your trip for covid regulations.
1st of all it looks your priority is sight seeing and that too in budget, believe me you are going worst time of the year as per your priority.
1> yes you have too,you may check railway retiring room too if booking available,there are some basic lodge/hotel infront of njp also,not a good option but may save some hassle traveling siliguri in night.
2>bus will take much more time than share cab but if budget is priority then go.
3>very less chance that north sikkim and nathula would be accessible,hope for the best.
4>no bus,you may get share cab from ghezing or/and jorangthan,
5>ok
6>don't find any reason to stay near batasia loop infact splitting stay, staying at a single place is better.
7>certainly not a walking distance,it's more than 15 km plus rains and last phase are bad roads which will be difficult to walk when raining,take a share cab,also in july visiting in morning for sunrise is wasting of time and money,you would find only clouds.even during days mostly cloudy.
8> easily,get a share cab in morning around 9 and will reach njp well before time.but in that case you have to visit tiger hill for sunrise which would be total wastage of money and time as suggested earlier.
//and apply for the required permits on the 1st day//
you don't have to apply, travel agent will apply.//
//along with nathula pass once i get the permit (gangtok - zuluk - nathula pass - changu - gangtok). i am hoping i could get a shared cab for this round trip.//
dzuluk not a single day trip,you can do gangtok tsongo nathula and back,share trip available around 700-800 rs,but if monsoon arrives with full fledged nathula would not be possible,even sometimes tsongo is doubtful.
//then start to lachung on 4th day (sunday) by public/shared transport, and homestay in lachung for 3 days. (pre-booking to be done i guess as i read all homestays can be booked via tourism packages)//
again weather dependent,less chance but not one can exactly predict.share package available around 3.5-4 k which includes fooding, lodging, transport and permit for 2 days 3 night to/from gangtok.
//so, can i manage with 14k in sikkim for 8 days? should i do pre-booking or should i not? my worry is that they may hike price if i don't do pre-booking//
if you do prebooking you are certainly going to pay more ,in july very few tourist in sikkim, all hotels vacant,taxi drivers and travel agent searching for tourist,can certainly get better deals on the spot.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g1162470-i14094-k13507625-Is_North_Sikkim_Open_for_tourism-Lachung_North_Sikkim_Sikkim.html,Is North Sikkim Open for tourism

the gateway middle north andaman - baratang - reaching experience - drive dense tropical forest - tribal reserve (you allowed step vehicle) - chance see jarawa tribal people (hunter,gatherer tribes dont want ‘civilized’ lead blissful life oldest tribes historically)
30 minute boat ride breathtaking mangroves - something see nat geo! trek forest see limestone caves
boat ride creeks watch 100s parrots reach parrot island - night time home
ross & smith islands connected sandbar disappears high tide
turtle nesting sites (during nesting season)
the famous radhanagar beach havelock
watersports havelock, neil, northbay
coral watching jollybuoy / redskin
history: cellular jail british imprisoned tortured indian freedom fighters, japanese bunkers, remnants british rule ross island (this different ross & smith), sound light shows both
i on, highlights. beware - facilities developing top notch - reason relatively unspoiled!
hopefully time travel, london - chennai direct flights resumed connecting flight there. (port blair international airport open soon direct flights!)
depending interests plan. idea
1 full day visiting cellular jail,samudrika marine museum, anthropological museum, chatham saw mill (if interests you) sunset watch trip chidiya tapu
1 full day northbay (sea walking) ross island
1 full day jolly buoy - coral viewing see combine mount harriet trek afternoon
3-4 full nights havelock enjoying beaches, scuba, sea walking, snorkelling etc
2-3 nights neil island
1 day baratang
3-4 nights north andaman - ross & smith, full day saddle peak trek, aam kunj beach etc
there option - much travel - spend week havelock resort radhanagar vijaynagar beaches nights neil islands night arrival night departure port blair town!
ps: reach havelock neil - ferries. baratang, north andaman - travel road. self drive cars available andaman, hire cab driver","andaman is definitely a great destination. it is not just about beaches and offers a lot of different things.
lovely, relatively unspoiled, less crowded beaches - if you go to north / middle andaman you may find even less people!
some of the best scuba diving sites in india
the gateway to middle and north andaman - baratang - reaching here is an experience - drive through dense tropical forest - it is also a tribal reserve (you are not allowed to step out of your vehicle) - chance to see jarawa tribal people (hunter,gatherer tribes who dont want to be ‘civilized’ and probably lead a very blissful life and one of the oldest tribes historically)
30 minute boat ride through breathtaking mangroves - something like what you see in nat geo! then trek through forest to see the limestone caves
boat ride through creeks to watch 100s of parrots reach parrot island - their night time home
ross & smith islands that are connected by a sandbar that disappears during high tide
turtle nesting sites (during the nesting season)
the famous radhanagar beach in havelock
watersports in havelock, neil, northbay
coral watching at jollybuoy / redskin
history: cellular jail where british imprisoned and tortured indian freedom fighters, japanese bunkers, remnants of british rule in ross island (this is different from ross & smith), sound and light shows at both
i can go on, but these are some highlights. but beware - facilities are still developing and may not be top notch - may be the reason why it is relatively unspoiled!
hopefully by the time you travel, london - chennai direct flights would have resumed and take a connecting flight from there. (port blair international airport will open soon and you may even have direct flights!)
depending on your interests you can plan. just to give you an idea
1 full day visiting cellular jail,samudrika marine museum, anthropological museum, chatham saw mill (if that interests you) and a sunset watch trip chidiya tapu
1 full day for northbay (sea walking) and ross island
1 full day for jolly buoy - coral viewing and see if you can combine a mount harriet trek in the afternoon
3-4 full nights in havelock enjoying the beaches, scuba, sea walking, snorkelling etc
2-3 nights in neil island
1 day for baratang
3-4 nights for north andaman - ross & smith, 1 full day for saddle peak trek, aam kunj beach etc
there is another great option - if so much of travel is not for you - spend a week in havelock in a resort either on the radhanagar or vijaynagar beaches and about 5 nights in the neil islands and just the night of arrival and night before departure in port blair town!
ps: to reach havelock and neil - you have to take ferries. for baratang, north andaman - you travel by road. self drive cars are not available in andaman, you have to hire a cab with driver",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g297583-i9941-k13495500-Andaman_1st_time-Andaman_and_Nicobar_Islands.html,andaman 1st

there group boy tourists drunk noisy night.","day 2
we woke up at around 7 in the morning. breakfast was ready by 8. a decent omlette and coffee was served. breakfast at all places were included in our package. we clicked some photographs at the orchard of the cottages and at the river bridge which was now a pretty sight (rather than scary the previous night). the staff helped us with our luggage to the car. we set off again on our mountainous road. my jio network disappeared as soon as we left dirang and only came back 5 days later when we reached dirang back. we stopped by to pick up some oranges - rs. 150 for a big bunch of them. this was going to be our source of vitamin c for the extreme cold ahead. the vegetation changed to coniferous/alpine. we also noticed significant presence of indian army and paramilitary agencies like itbp, ssb along the route.
after around 2 hours (around noon) we reached sela pass. the temperature felt anywhere between 0 and 5 degrees. there was a good amount of snow, but the lake was not frozen. we were slipping and sliding at the start of our descent as the snow had turned into smooth ice with everyone walking over it. but then we saw some people walk comfortably just beside the actual path. although our legs were going into the snow, atleast we did not risk falling down by slipping. we gained courage and walked down to the lake and were rewarded. hardly anyone came to the lake during our 30 min stay there. we clicked some good pictures and then walked back up to the car and proceeded towards tawang. our shoes got wet there and i had to remove mine. i wore sandals and 500 meters later, we saw the other side of sela lake had beautiful views too. i got down to click from pics and walked around 100 meters away. i ran back to the car when i started to realise my toes were numbing. i immediately took steps to warm my toes up as i was scared of losing them to frostbite.
we reached nuranang/jung falls around 4 pm. arindham gave us an hour at the falls as the sun was on its way down. the falls was quite empty. something we noticed in arunachal that the crowds were quite less. more picturesque than the falls though was the river. we dipped our hands in the river and it was frigid. we left at around 5 pm and made the journey towards tawang with headlights. we reached our hotel - yul pemakhar at around 6:30 pm. the hotel was a bit away from the main market and was closer to the monastary. two boys from the hotel took our bags and immediately climbed up two floors with them. they showed us our room and took our order for dinner which they said will be available only by 8:30 pm. our room was spacious and had a wooden look, had a heater and the gyser took around 20 mins to heat the water. dinner was decent and not overpriced, they could not offer anything local as the boys were from assam and the hotel had just opened up on march 8th after the lockdown and they hadnt got a cook who specializes in tibetan food yet.

when came room, noticed window planked up. thanks pappu prompt action. arindham tried search chicken tawang away trip, could find any.","day 3
we noticed that our bathroom shared a window with the adjacent bathroom where the group of boys were staying and brought it to the notice of pappu from the hotel staff. someone from the other room could actually place their mobile strategically and see whats happening in our bathroom. also, the boys smoked a lot and our bathroom filled with smoke.
next morning we were served french toast and coffee by 7:30 am. by 8 am, our scorpio driven by tawang local tashi arrived. the innova crysta from assam is not allowed north of tawang and has to be a local vehicle which is a four wheel drive.
he explained how tawang was actually a part of tibet and how half of ended up in india and china due to the mcmohan line being drawn across it. we steadily gained altitude and soon snow was a common sight. we first stopped at ptso lake. it looked majestic draped in snow all around. we spent around half an hour sliding and making snow angels in the snow when tashi came to call us. he said that we have to be at a place called y junction before 10 am or else the army wont allow us to proceed towards bumla. we reached y junction around 9:55 and then proceeded towards bumla. the temperature had dropped and the sun reflected on the snow everywhere was blinding. it was difficult to see anything without wearing glares. we reached around 11 am. we kept our mobiles with tashi in the car. he asked us to note down our car registration as we would be asked at the registration desk. we went into a room run by the military where we had to register and give our names and vehicle number. there was a ladies washroom nearby which the girls used. the army also had maggi and soup for sale which was not all that great but given that both were boiling hot in such conditions provided us some heat. everyone was asked to deposit their mobiles at the counter, with a warning that if the officers at the border view point found the mobile they would reset it. one of us still had our cellphone and complied and deposited our mobiles. finally, the army took us 10 meters short of the border where they explained to us about the war, the border, etc.there were a few overzealous tourists who kept requesting the army to allow them to go right up to the chinese border, however the army guy kept refusing that he has to follow orders. when we came back to the room with the desk, we were returned our mobiles. we rested for a little while as the thin mountain air did put a bit of pressure on our lungs. please carry sun glasses to this place, the glare of the sun on the snow can be pretty harsh. also, do not exert yourself too much, the oxygen is less and you may end up getting altitude sickness. while resting the army officer asked if anyone wants to go again, since the next batch had a very few people. bumla is called bumula by the locals – la meaning height and bumula stands for a very beautiful woman.
we proceeded back to the car and after a few mins came across the highest cafeteria of the world. this was run by the army and we had a few talks with them about their daily lives. it soon started snowing lightly and the sight outside was pretty. we set off on our way. our driver tashi was very patient and stopped at several pretty sights on the way. we saw a number of frozen lakes and took a lot of pictures. the snow got heavier and tashi obliged when we asked him to stop for some pictures. we reached back to our room at around 2 pm and were pretty tired. we rested for a while. our vodafone and airtel networks disappeared at around 3:30 pm for a day, may be their tower stopped functioning. note: that mobile network for the whole trip is patchy. vodafone/airtel work upto tawang and jio works only upto dirang. there are parts in the mountains which receive no network at all. bsnl works well in arunachal.
arindham came to call us to go for a light and sound show at tawang war memorial. before the memorial he took us to a giant buddha statue that overlooks tawang. we saw several people on their evening walk there, while others were praying by making rounds of the statue. it also seemed like hang out spot for youth. we reached the war memorial at around 5:30 pm. arindham told us to look around and then go for the show at 6 pm. we saw the war memorial to our heroes who defended against chinese aggression in the 1962 war. at 5:50 pm, when we went for the light and sound show, there was already a crowd gathered. the army guys were trying to figure out how to accommodate so many people amidst calls to put us in the second show (7 pm?), they some how brought some chairs and accomodated us, although we couldnt see the show clearly. the show added a lot of context to the trip.
since we wanted to taste some local food, we asked arindham to take us to a local hotel. he took us to mon valley in the tawang market. the food there was really good, we took chicken momos and thukpa. each momo plate was accompanied by soup. the quantity was also quite a lot. the hotel also closed immediately after we left. on our way back, it was just 7:30 pm, but the roads were deserted and quiet. the town had shut for the night.
when we came back to our room, we noticed that the window was planked up. thanks to pappu for the prompt action. arindham had tried to search for chicken at tawang while we were away on our trip, he could not find any.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g297589-i12212-k13514032-Trip_Report_Arunachal_Pradesh_and_Kaziranga_9D8N_Mar21-Arunachal_Pradesh.html,Trip Report - Arunachal

thank you.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g297686-i9385-k13489659-Next_Year_december_snow_fall_trip-Uttarakhand.html,Next Year december snow fall trip,Dipika_Vishwakarma,UAE,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dipika_Vishwakarma?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,400,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,40000,"[""['hello',"", ""'early',"", ""'travel',"", ""'dubai',"", ""'country',"", ""'experience',"", ""'snowfall',"", ""'india',"", ""'india',"", ""'wed',"", ""'november',"", ""'end',"", ""'help',"", ""'plan',"", ""'trip',"", ""'3',"", ""'people',"", ""'couple',"", ""'5',"", ""'old',"", ""'kid',"", ""'date',"", ""'nov',"", ""'end',"", ""'december',"", ""'week',"", ""'max',"", ""'8',"", ""'days',"", ""'trip',"", ""'place',"", ""'interest',"", ""'uttarakhand',"", ""'himachal',"", ""'pradesh',"", ""'snow',"", ""'fall',"", ""'december',"", ""'week',"", ""'preference100',"", ""'snow',"", ""'fall',"", ""'december',"", ""'week',"", ""'see',"", ""'post',"", ""'snow',"", ""'fall',"", ""'experience',"", ""'january',"", ""'february',"", ""'except',"", ""'many',"", ""'see',"", ""'snowfall',"", ""'week',"", ""'december',"", ""'place',"", ""'highest',"", ""'probability',"", ""'receive',"", ""'snow',"", ""'time',"", ""'date',"", ""'place',"", ""'visit',"", ""'son',"", ""'much',"", ""'excite',"", ""'see',"", ""'snow',"", ""'fall',"", ""'snow',"", ""'activities',"", ""'plan',"", ""'advance']""]",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

surely much has change, good & bad, as i was there a very long time ago, and would never return. water / sewer treatment plant must have had an oops when we there, as surf was disgusting. damn near forgot about that little holiday, thanks 🤣

edited: 4:22 pm, january 04,","i visited thailand in 1989, i went with my grandmother who had lived in phuket or in bhuket as it was known when she lived there in the 1960’s. they lived in phuket town and in 1989 i was lucky to see the house they had lived in and the communal swimming pool my grandfather had helped build. we met my grandparent’s thai friends and it it was an amazing experience for me at aged 17 and for my grandmother to return after over 20 years. as soon as i stepped off the plane it was different to europe, the smells and the noise and the traffic in bangkok. i still clearly remember the journey from the airport into bangkok.
i have a silver cigarette box that was presented to my grandma when she left a thailand as a thank you for teaching the thais scottish country dancing. in 1989 she could not believe that the island she had called the last place on god’s earth was now a destination people called paradise and the number of hotels! a trip to the beach in the 1960s was a journey along bumpy roads, there were no hotels. i spent an amazing 5 weeks starting in bangkok, visiting pattaya, phuket, penang and kl, ending in singapore.
it was such an enjoyable trip that we returned in 1998 with my grandma and husband. her house in phuket was now inhabited and the communal pool empty. i would love to find out the exact location. my husband and i loved our trip, sadly we lost my grandma in 1999. it was a delightful surprise when my brother announced he was moving to bangkok in 2001 to teach for a few months, he intended to move onto japan and other countries, 20 years later he is still in bangkok and is now married with two children. we have managed to visit twice with our kids and once on our own and now hope to visit every year. last february was our first winter trip which was absolutely amazing to get away from the cold weather. can’t wait to be able to return and think it will be an annual winter trip for us.

we thailand years ago (dec/jan) flew in/out phuket, spent weeks island hopping koh lipe different experience time.
what could add place chiang mai mountainous, temple, jungle... experience? crazy big cities, prefer laid places (hence night bangkok way home). we’d happy beach trip wanted check something time around.
thank you!","hoping it works out to go to thailand next year (booked refundable flights already for a great price!)
my original plan was to head to chiang mai area for the first 4-5 days, then finish the trip off with a week or so around koh tao/koh samui for some beach and diving time, then a night or two in bangkok before flying home.
then i discovered burning season might make chiang mai a bad idea (had not heard of that before)...
we have been to thailand once before a few years ago (dec/jan) and flew in/out of phuket, spent 2 weeks island hopping between there and koh lipe so would like to have a different experience this time.
what could we add in place of chiang mai for some mountainous, temple, jungle... experience? not too crazy about big cities, prefer laid back places (hence just a night or 2 in bangkok on the way home). i know we’d be happy at the beach but since that was all we did the first trip there just wanted to check out something other than just that this time around.

i do love it here, just a heads up post for those that research (not on this site obviously🤣 ) but choose your where & when carefully. north - crisp clear skies, in between the raindrops during green season, and lovely.
beach holiday (for in the surf or that turquoise look), not the gulf, unless just looking, and iffy all year imho. anyone tell you different, definitely has a vested interest. 20 yrs experience on both, and andaman sea side consistently better most of the year.

we are planning to get away for christmas and ny so i thought phuket/krabi might be a good option? our boys enjoy all water sports, i love snorkeling/diving and everyone enjoys nature but we wanted to be at least 2 weeks by the beach.
we are planning to fly out 17th december returning 8th january so have 3 weeks. what would you recommend? i personally don't like it too crowded but we may have to find a happy medium.
i went to ko phi phi in 1994 and it was lovely, also stayed for a couple of nights at karon beach in phuket but this did not compare to ko phi phi but of course all will be very different now.
any advice much appreciated.

as pointed out, nothing will be a version of pp 1994, well, except for now, at int'l tourist beach areas, and probably a little too quiet for most folks. just came back from phuket, and with few exceptions, all beach areas were dead, and most vendors shuttered.

how soon that will change, if & when things open up is a guess, so should still be fairly quiet, relative to mass crowds of pre-c19.
i'd choose pp for the water / diving part, as closer to. out of phuket, and they are all day affairs, as most go to the same sites. hours vs minutes to same sites.
you probably know already, but the boys are men, and hotels will consider them as such .... lol, pricing wise, so budget wise, villa & suites may be a bit thrifty, if wanting to be near each other. or since young men enjoy nightlife of the island, their privacy may be a bit more of a priority.
wouldn't book any hotels that need to be paid for, or non refundable rates, if wanting to lock in some 'covid discounts'. also encourage the 'boys' to do a bit of research, and they, and yourself may enjoy a night or 2 on phuket, possibly bangla rd, and should be festive, maybe by year's end.

one last question please: is krabi/koh lanta very busy now? i guess this has equally changed or is it quieter than phuket? just in case they insist on a beach holiday.
i only plan to book flights i can cancel and will only book rooms with this option too as i realise nobody knows what's going on. i just hope by december there is light!

people from cold countries such as the uk often fail to appreciate that unlike in their home countries where cloudy weather means being cold and the outdoors gloomy in the tropics the days are just as bright and also you can walk on the sand without burning your feet. add to that returning to the uk between october to june is no fun at all - landing on cold days with only six layers of t shirts to keep you warm.
the whole of the country doesn't grind to a halt from may onwards and if you do get wet you dry off pretty quickly. the only bad news about coming in july instead of january is you need a shower to cool down after swimming as the sea is too hot !",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g293915-i3686-k13586486-What_If-Thailand.html,What If,Sampag1ta,0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sampag1ta?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,200,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,50,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,200,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,42500,"[""['14',"", ""'wrong',"", ""'rainy',"", ""'season',"", ""'live',"", ""'tropics',"", ""'sun',"", ""'beat',"", ""'12',"", ""'hours',"", ""'day',"", ""'spend',"", ""'9',"", ""'till',"", ""'4',"", ""'huddle',"", ""'shade',"", ""'people',"", ""'cold',"", ""'countries',"", ""'uk',"", ""'fail',"", ""'unlike',"", ""'home',"", ""'countries',"", ""'cloudy',"", ""'weather',"", ""'cold',"", ""'outdoors',"", ""'gloomy',"", ""'tropics',"", ""'days',"", ""'bright',"", ""'walk',"", ""'sand',"", ""'burn',"", ""'feet',"", ""'add',"", ""'uk',"", ""'october',"", ""'june',"", ""'fun',"", ""'land',"", ""'cold',"", ""'days',"", ""'six',"", ""'layer',"", ""'shirt',"", ""'keep',"", ""'warm',"", ""'whole',"", ""'country',"", ""'grind',"", ""'halt',"", ""'may',"", ""'onwards',"", ""'wet',"", ""'dry',"", ""'pretty',"", ""'quickly',"", ""'bad',"", ""'news',"", ""'july',"", ""'instead',"", ""'january',"", ""'shower',"", ""'cool',"", ""'swim',"", ""'sea',"", ""'hot']""]",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

note--i posted this message in the thailand forum by mistake but don't know how to remove that post.
as i wrote in the bkk and cm forums, i am planning to take my senior parents to asia where food is good and affordable in 2022 for 1-2 months. the time frame will be from late march to mid/late may. from the friendly members in ta, i learn that chiang mai's air quality is extremely bad during this time--and so i have ruled out cm. bangkok is further away from the mountains, but can get hot.
can anybody give me a comparison of how the heat is like in bangkok vs hong kong and singapore? i personally don't like hong kong as a destination (too $$$ with too little to do), and its summer temperature often is lower than it actually feels because of hot island effects. singapore sits on the equator and only has one season. the heat is not as stifling as that in hong kong, as long as one isn't outdoor during daytime much. singapore's air also feels cleaner than hk's, except during the bush burning season in indonesia.
in bkk, i have pretty much decided to stay away from the central areas with lots of skyscrapers trapping heat.
i understand that i can look at historical temp/humidity charts, but they often don't tell one what it actually feels like on the ground. would appreciate your advice. thanks.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g293916-i3687-k13516582-Bangkok_vs_Singapore_and_Hong_Kong_in_March_May-Bangkok.html,Bangkok vs Singapore and Hong Kong in March-May,Doggielover,US,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EnjoyTravelingMuch?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,100,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,100,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,100,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,100,0,0,100,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,50000,"[""['dear',"", ""'note',"", ""'post',"", ""'message',"", ""'thailand',"", ""'forum',"", ""'mistake',"", ""'remove',"", ""'post',"", ""'write',"", ""'bkk',"", ""'cm',"", ""'forums',"", ""'plan',"", ""'senior',"", ""'parent',"", ""'asia',"", ""'food',"", ""'good',"", ""'affordable',"", ""'2022',"", ""'1',"", ""'2',"", ""'months',"", ""'time',"", ""'frame',"", ""'late',"", ""'march',"", ""'mid',"", ""'late',"", ""'may',"", ""'friendly',"", ""'members',"", ""'ta',"", ""'learn',"", ""'chiang',"", ""'mais',"", ""'air',"", ""'quality',"", ""'extremely',"", ""'bad',"", ""'time',"", ""'rule',"", ""'cm',"", ""'bangkok',"", ""'away',"", ""'mountains',"", ""'hot',"", ""'anybody',"", ""'comparison',"", ""'heat',"", ""'bangkok',"", ""'vs',"", ""'hong',"", ""'kong',"", ""'singapore',"", ""'personally',"", ""'hong',"", ""'kong',"", ""'destination',"", ""'little',"", ""'summer',"", ""'temperature',"", ""'lower',"", ""'feel',"", ""'hot',"", ""'island',"", ""'effect',"", ""'singapore',"", ""'sit',"", ""'equator',"", ""'one',"", ""'season',"", ""'heat',"", ""'stifle',"", ""'hong',"", ""'kong',"", ""'long',"", ""'one',"", ""'isnt',"", ""'outdoor',"", ""'daytime',"", ""'much',"", ""'singapores',"", ""'air',"", ""'feel',"", ""'cleaner',"", ""'hks',"", ""'except',"", ""'bush',"", ""'burn',"", ""'season',"", ""'indonesia',"", ""'bkk',"", ""'pretty',"", ""'much',"", ""'stay',"", ""'away',"", ""'central',"", ""'areas',"", ""'lot',"", ""'skyscrapers',"", ""'trap',"", ""'heat',"", ""'historical',"", ""'temp',"", ""'humidity',"", ""'chart',"", ""'tell',"", ""'one',"", ""'feel',"", ""'grind',"", ""'advice']""]",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

i actually did not find singapore to be too hot or humid and i went in may. the weather was bearable for me, but for me there wasn't a lot to do and the food wasn't as good as i expected.
for bangkok, i usually go at either end of the year or beginning and the weather is fine for me. but it goes get back if you are out and about a lot especially in the day time.
so in conclusion hk is the worst for me, followed by bkk and sg was fine.

250,3052,TH,"replies.
i answer easy. personally love beach folks senior that. issue hk singapore worked expat year thus traveling places reminds work. job.
i research phuket, real community best beaches. want consider bkk lounge pool hot afternoons. riding taxis time expensive either. public transit available acts good alternative transit mode traffic bad.
as far mediterranean concerned, believe weather stable enough till least mid may. also, parents see asia time. covid situation eu seems far worst thailand, singapore, hk. love greece parents excited it. 2019, spent five ""eat, pray, love"" type weeks spain portugal alone. love (i call ""romance myself"") romantic parents.
so, next question is: phuket, find places nice beaches real local communities? believe phuket, stay phuket town local feel drive around. thought pattaya, parents hated red light districts visited decade ago. considered mexico, soon dismissed due high crime.
edited: 7:53 pm, april 03,","thank you for the replies.
i know that the answer won't be easy. i personally love the beach but my folks are too senior for that. another issue with hk and singapore is that i worked there as an expat for one year and thus traveling in these places reminds me of work. i didn't like my then job.
i will do some research about phuket, which has more of a real community though it doesn't have the best beaches. i still want to consider bkk as we can always just lounge by the pool in hot afternoons. riding taxis all the time isn't expensive either. public transit is available and acts as a good alternative transit mode when traffic is bad.
as far as the mediterranean is concerned, i believe the weather is still not stable enough till at least mid may. also, my parents would like to see asia this time. the covid situation in eu also seems to be far worst than thailand, singapore, and hk. i love greece but my parents aren't too excited about it. in 2019, i spent five ""eat, pray, love"" type weeks in spain and portugal alone. love it (i call this ""romance with myself"") but i don't think it is romantic with my parents.
so, my next question is: other than phuket, where can i find places with both nice beaches and real local communities? i believe that in phuket, i would stay around phuket town since there is a more local feel and that i don't have to drive around. i also thought about pattaya, but my parents hated the red light districts when they visited a decade ago. i also considered mexico, but soon dismissed it due to high crime.

if your kids like nature, perhaps in lieu of chiang mai (save it for a future winter trip) check out kanchanaburi or khao sok. kids might get a kick out of a couple nights in a hotel floating on cheiw larn lake in khao sok, being able to jump into the water for swim right off the rooms porch. or a couple nights in safari tents at elephant hills in khao sok.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g293915-i3686-k13548533-Feedback_on_4_week_family_iteniary_BKK_CM_PHKT_Phi_Phi-Thailand.html,"Feedback on 4 week family iteniary BKK, CM, PHKT, Phi Phi",MrCycling 🚵‍♂️,US,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrCycling?tab=forum,0,0,100,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,100,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,100,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,100,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,100,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,50000,"[""['question',"", ""'one',"", ""'children',"", ""'car',"", ""'sick',"", ""'night',"", ""'train',"", ""'wise',"", ""'choice',"", ""'heat',"", ""'factor',"", ""'march',"", ""'april',"", ""'may',"", ""'summer',"", ""'thailand',"", ""'northern',"", ""'reach',"", ""'quite',"", ""'hot',"", ""'upper',"", ""'30s',"", ""'low',"", ""'40s',"", ""'kid',"", ""'nature',"", ""'lieu',"", ""'chiang',"", ""'mai',"", ""'save',"", ""'future',"", ""'winter',"", ""'trip',"", ""'kanchanaburi',"", ""'khao',"", ""'sok',"", ""'kid',"", ""'kick',"", ""'couple',"", ""'nights',"", ""'hotel',"", ""'float',"", ""'cheiw',"", ""'larn',"", ""'lake',"", ""'khao',"", ""'sok',"", ""'able',"", ""'jump',"", ""'water',"", ""'swim',"", ""'right',"", ""'room',"", ""'porch',"", ""'couple',"", ""'nights',"", ""'safari',"", ""'tent',"", ""'elephant',"", ""'hill',"", ""'khao',"", ""'sok']""]",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

in short, bodies of water heat up or cool down (absorb or release energy) depending on their surroundings (which can be the sun beating down on them, cool night air etc).
as a general rule the smaller the body of water the more easily they will lose or gain heat. the larger the body of water the longer it takes for this to occur. this is why:
- pools are cooler in the morning- they have been cooled by the night air. this effect will be stronger if you are in an area with cold nights, ie mountains, deserts etc. to overcome this you can heat pools or put a cover over them at night but both are expensive, resource heavy options.
- the ocean is still cold during spring and the first hot days of summer - it's too big to warm up quickly
- the ocean is surprisingly warm in autumn/fall,- it takes some time to cool after the heat of summer

we spent a month in thailand feb 2020 with our children aged 8 and 11. absolutely amazing experience and so worthwhile doing with them.
our itinerary was:
3 nights bangkok stayed at ibis riverside (great family rooms)
2 nights khao yai stayed at greenleaf and did the afternoon tour on 1st day then full day tour on 2nd day. absolutely amazing place and greenleaf is highly recommended. tours were incredible and we saw wild elephants as well as so much else.
next we got train to ayutthaya and spent afternoon on temple tour before getting night train to chiang mai.
7 nights at chiang mai which again absolutely fabulous with kids. highlights were day with karen tribe native elephants (cant recommended highly enough), sticky waterfalls, big game fishing, grand canyon water park.
then we got direct flight to krabi and taxi to koh lanta for 5 nights. koh lanta amazing and very family friendly. best day ever was a private long-tail trip to koh rok, most magical day of my life with lanta paradise i think was called. also loved car hire and going to national park, and mangrove kayaking trip.
after this we got speedboat to koh mook for 3 nights. very quiet but very pretty and a totally different vibe as not at all developed, no real roads, no 7/11, no atm etc. loved it here, only thing put me off going back was a hotel behind main beach been knocked down and was quite a building site.
next got speedboat to koh lipe for 4 nights. stayed at castaway in family house. absolutely stunning here, like nowhere else i've been. but busier. snorkeling incredible and the water the most beautiful crystal clear turquoise colour. loved it.
then flew from hat yai to bangkok for 1 more night before heading home.

edited: 2:24 am, june 27,","@ felix. you have to stay 3 days in your hotel and can only do guided tours activities around ko samui, ko phangan and ko tao for another 4 days. those activities apparently includes diving, snorkeling, sailing etc.
samui used to have a ‘field hospital’ for covid cases: a beachfront resort in lamai.
there are likely to be flights from hong kong and singapore to samui once the scheme is officially approved. also transiting through bangkok is probably possible as well.

edited: 12:53 pm, august 28,","there's a little funfair with rides for young children on the pier, and in the last couple of days a new ferris wheel has also appeared on the pier - 
bonkerz is an indoor play centre which might be a useful place to visit if it's raining - 
if the weather is nice there are two beaches to visits - the north shore and the west shore (of which west shore is by far the better beach).
there's a toboggan run at the ski centre on the great orme. it's up quite a steep hill but you can drive up and there's a car park - 
bodafon farm park would be a good place to visit with young children. it's a bit of a way from the town centre so you'd need to drive there but again there's a car park on the site.
there is parking throughout llandudno but it's a mixture of street parking with time limits, street parking with no time limits and car parks that you have to park on. it's not a big town and other than the great orme it's mostly flat so your best bet might be to find somewhere reasonably central so you don't have to keep moving your car. the town hall car park might be an option if you're happy to pay and display or there are car parks at maelgwyn road and york road which are a bit cheaper but a bit further from the town centre - 
the postcode for the copper mines is ll30 2xg - there's a car park on site.

-book the guided tour in advance. it was sold out for the day i went, and i had been waiting many years to visit the cathedral (romanesque architecture is my absolute favorite). it did not even occur to me that i needed to book many days in advance. i honestly thought i would cry when they kindly said it was sold out*. i texted my children and husband; my husband offered to try to find me a private tour guide immediately, but there was not way that could have worked out. very sweet of him, though.
-tour groups are currently limited to 5 or 6 ppl total. i was confused bc there was at least 1 large school group there on that day; many more than 5-6 ppl. i realize the rules come from the uk govt, not the cathedral. i realize that the cathedral is doing its best to follow what seem to be confusing rules (a big school group = ok, +6 adults in a tour group = not ok). it is what it is--just know them before you go.
-reserve a table in the cafe if you think you might eat there, or eat after 2pm.
*i did not cry, although i may never get to go to durham again (i live in tx), because of the volunteers at the cathedral. i would especially like to highlight hazel, a docent who was so helpful. she was like an angel. she answered my many questions in great detail and was the best of the british--kind, knowledgeable, and with a reserve that comes from a deep well of very good manners. she made me feel i could ask as many questions as i wanted to.
another female docent, tall, thin, with a sporty short haircut, encouraged me to buy a guidebook (which i did) and it was so helpful. many thanks to her.
it was a miserable day--chilly and pouring rain. a chipper younger woman at the entrance pointed out the river path to the bridge, and i'm so glad she did; it was a wonderful (although chilly) walk.
i arrived on a train from london; there is a bus that runs you to the cathedral every 15 minutes or so. many thanks to the women working in the station that day who pointed me in the right direction to catch the bus.
the bus driver was so nice and friendly. such an asset to durham and i'm sorry i did not make note of his name.
i had not eaten all day and, after seeing most of the cathedral, i went down to the cafe on a chance; there was 1 unreserved table at 2:15 (the guided tour started at 2). the women working in the cafe were very helpful. i had the lasagna special (lasagna, bread, and a salad) and a giant (hot and cozy) latte. my lunch was delicious and perfect for the weather.
there was a young, young woman in the gift shop; she was precious and sweet. the shop has a very good book on the architecture of the cathedral which i have been reading.
i wandered around the immediate area before catching the bus back to the train station and back to london. 6 hours on a train; 3 hours in durham.
all of the people i have referenced were at their posts after 12:20 on july 6. they deserve recognition. if there is any way to forward my thanks to them, please let me know.
the cathedral is exceptional and durham, even in the pouring rain, was charming. it was well worth the 3 hours there and 3 hours back on the train.

i'm currently looking for ideas for our holiday this year, restrictions permitting, of course.
i have to possible weeks when we can visit, due to annual leave approval at work - these are either a week mid august or a week at the beginning of september. which would be best?
second question is regarding where to go... we usually travel a bit further afield but after an amazing holiday in the scottish highlands last year, we've decided to explore closer to home. we would like to spend our holiday enjoying scenic walks, a bit of sightseeing and with good food - plus maybe even a day or two on the beach if the weather is kind. which island would you recommend? or would the scilly isles be a better destination? do you have any particular recommendations? we would love to have access to a pool if possible and don't really want to be self catering.
i have visited guernsey a few times as a teenager and loved it, but the most recent visit was more than 1 5 years ago.
we are planning on driving from cheshire and getting the ferry from southampton (as my partner doesn't fancy flying or going through an airport) but understand we won't really need the car when we get there.
any thoughts much appreciated!

#2 and #4 - i guess it might get moved into trip reports, but i deliberately didn't put it in there, because i get the impression noone ever looks in there. i thought it might be allowed to stay in the general scotland section on the basis that others contributed towards planning the trip (sounds like a lame argument tbf haha)
#3 that was the storm that hit when i was at the top of the quirang. on the way out it was glorious weather, then as we got to the top it closed right in and visibility dropped to almost nothing. quite a bit of hail, but it cleared up enough for us (i was tagging along with some others, one of whom had a map app on his mobile), to get back to the car park literally moments before the temp dropped to zero and the skies opened for an hour and a half of heavy snow.
i'll get those photos sorted out asap.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g186485-i107-k13543455-Trip_done_on_my_way_home-Scotland.html,Trip done - on my way home,Rob,0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Robs2ndattempt?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,300,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,134,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,300,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,68978,"[""['1',"", ""'mac',"", ""'wasnt',"", ""'dissappointed',"", ""'weather',"", ""'wasnt',"", ""'perfect',"", ""'work',"", ""'fine',"", ""'ie',"", ""'walk',"", ""'generally',"", ""'sunshine',"", ""'real',"", ""'affect',"", ""'weather',"", ""'camp',"", ""'6',"", ""'foot',"", ""'4',"", ""'standard',"", ""'length',"", ""'2',"", ""'season',"", ""'sleep',"", ""'bag',"", ""'good',"", ""'trip',"", ""'lot',"", ""'many',"", ""'help',"", ""'blimey',"", ""'1400',"", ""'miles',"", ""'12',"", ""'days',"", ""'2',"", ""'4',"", ""'guess',"", ""'move',"", ""'trip',"", ""'report',"", ""'deliberately',"", ""'impression',"", ""'noone',"", ""'ever',"", ""'allow',"", ""'stay',"", ""'general',"", ""'scotland',"", ""'section',"", ""'basis',"", ""'others',"", ""'contribute',"", ""'plan',"", ""'trip',"", ""'sound',"", ""'lame',"", ""'argument',"", ""'tbf',"", ""'3',"", ""'storm',"", ""'hit',"", ""'top',"", ""'quirang',"", ""'way',"", ""'glorious',"", ""'weather',"", ""'top',"", ""'close',"", ""'right',"", ""'visibility',"", ""'drop',"", ""'quite',"", ""'hail',"", ""'clear',"", ""'tag',"", ""'others',"", ""'one',"", ""'map',"", ""'app',"", ""'mobile',"", ""'car',"", ""'park',"", ""'literally',"", ""'moments',"", ""'temp',"", ""'drop',"", ""'zero',"", ""'sky',"", ""'open',"", ""'hour',"", ""'half',"", ""'heavy',"", ""'snow',"", ""'ill',"", ""'photos',"", ""'sort',"", ""'asap']""]",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

yuri.","i’m glad ripon had it’s problem sorted out.
i was looking at the week starting at 30.7.21.
wood burner in july. there’re english summers, and there’re english summers. 3 years ago, when we visited yorkshire it was so hot! water in aysgarth falls dried out. all of the gardens looked miserable, and sun burnt.
2 years ago, in dartmoor there were many rainy days, with temperatures dropping to +16c during the day ( our winter temperature). reaching your cottage after being caught in the rain - wood burner is useful and cozy. our resilience to cold is different to yours. we had a one day heat wave (+29c), just two days ago.
also, i’m only looking at the cottages with larger fridge, since we’re eating breakfasts and dinners at “home”. we’ve hired cottages with them smallish installed fridges before. it’s been annoying, to go to the supermarket every second day.
we need two bathrooms! teenage girls need their time in shower, and i’m an ale drinking diabetic...
we need a garden, with outdoor seating. that’s where i spend my evenings drinking tea, smoking, etc.
we don’t like them compound like a few cottages sharing a yard. we’ve stayed in such place in peak district by monyash once. there were a few noisy families there. girls felt they had to behave at all times, instead of allowing themselves to act freely. it’s not like they’re doing something criminal. they like to dance, sing, jump, play badminton, chess, chase bunnies, etc. i like to make them feel comfortable. both are extremely hard working students, and they deserve their time off the rules&regulations.
all in all, choosing a holiday cottage is always uneasy task for me. corona only made things more complicated.
since most ( if not all ) of the self catering bookings are totally refundable nowadays. i’d expect late vacancies to pop up. that, if uk will allow british folks to travel abroad. then, it’ll go back to normality: when you stand better chance to meet a brit in crete, than in the oxford street, london!

okay. the state of tamil nadu actually gets most of its rain in the northwest monsoon from october to december; rather than the southwest monsoon between july and september.
even so, chennai / pondy / and other coastal places will still get rain in august; average temperatures will be in the mid 30s. along the coast in the sub-tropics you should expect quite humid conditions - depending on what you are used to. madurai and other inland places are likely to be drier, with similar temperatures. note that there is very little relief from the temperatures at night - mid 20s perhaps.
generally speaking, the best time to go - weather wise - would be january - march; after the monsoon so you avoid the rain and get cooler weather. late january - early februay would be my pick.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g297675-i7547-k13465220-Tamil_Nadu_July_August-Coimbatore_Coimbatore_District_Tamil_Nadu.html,Tamil Nadu July/August,DrRudi,AU,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DrRudi?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,50,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,200,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,22500,"[""['plan',"", ""'rent',"", ""'car',"", ""'driver',"", ""'good',"", ""'choice',"", ""'itinerary',"", ""'chennai',"", ""'mahabalipuram',"", ""'pondicherry',"", ""'kumbakonam',"", ""'thanjavur',"", ""'tiruchirapalli',"", ""'chettinad',"", ""'madurai',"", ""'state',"", ""'tamil',"", ""'nadu',"", ""'rain',"", ""'northwest',"", ""'monsoon',"", ""'october',"", ""'december',"", ""'southwest',"", ""'monsoon',"", ""'july',"", ""'september',"", ""'chennai',"", ""'pondy',"", ""'coastal',"", ""'place',"", ""'rain',"", ""'august',"", ""'average',"", ""'temperatures',"", ""'mid',"", ""'30s',"", ""'coast',"", ""'sub',"", ""'tropics',"", ""'expect',"", ""'quite',"", ""'humid',"", ""'madurai',"", ""'inland',"", ""'place',"", ""'drier',"", ""'similar',"", ""'temperatures',"", ""'note',"", ""'little',"", ""'relief',"", ""'temperatures',"", ""'night',"", ""'mid',"", ""'20s',"", ""'generally',"", ""'speak',"", ""'time',"", ""'weather',"", ""'wise',"", ""'january',"", ""'march',"", ""'monsoon',"", ""'avoid',"", ""'rain',"", ""'cooler',"", ""'weather',"", ""'late',"", ""'january',"", ""'early',"", ""'februay',"", ""'pick']""]",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

dec 31: bomdilla guwahati - 217 kms 38 km/hr
left bomdilla early morning, reached guwahati pm. made sure road travel night.
note locals : never met hospitable welcoming people arunachal pradesh locals india. loved food too. shut shop pm, live simple enough life. appreciation beauty sorrounds want others experience - thats wanna revisit sometime life.
note roads : tezpur -> bhalukpong -> bomdilla route took coming tenga valley -> samteng -> bhairabkunda -> orang route took going back. roads second route 10 times never repeat mistake following route. nightmare, rocky road construction every kms km's strectches bad road. plus late night dark gain altitude fast route many hairpin bends.
because construction route, built time reader travels highly recommend second route. snowfall 30th dec night snow (not lot) coming tawang risky narrow roads. driving experienced driver strict no.
note drinks : try local ara, shots together :p
overall, best trip india far heartbeat xoxo","here are my notes from north east india trip. hope these are helpful to other community members. we had total 12 days for the trip. itinerary below lists activities and useful tips:
dates : 20 dec 2020 - 2 jan 2021
dec 20 - land at guwahati
dec 20 - dec 27 -> meghalaya
dec 27 - jan 1 -> arunachal
jan 2 -> assam and fly back to bangalore
bomdilla : you get great cafes here, rooms etc. there are atms easily available too. well connected to everywhere and is the best focal point to stay. you can explore dirang and other places nearby. at a lower altitude than tawang so temperatures are warmer. the whole town shuts down at about 6 pm though like in other towns in arunachal pradesh.
tawang : at night temperatures fell to -5. the town itself isn't so big and not much tourist attractions except a monastry. the main attraction is going even higher to the border areas.
i really wanted to cover mechuka too but didn't have time. i am pretty sure i will miss some things in this post so feel free to contact me over mail at shivam.agarwal345@gmail.com or just ping me. instagram hanle - agrwl_shivam
pre-trip preparations:
1. obtain inner line permit to enter arunachal pradesh: this was covid times and there was a lot of confusion regarding this. seemed from reviews that online application is enough but we submitted our application on dec 15 and it was never processed. you cannot enter arunachal without one.
we were lucky to get it from a travel agency called holiday homes. they overcharged but got it done in 2 days.
2. if you plan on crossing states like i did, during these times the covid certificate is only valid for 4 days so you may need to get tested again.
- as soon as we entered meghalaya border from guwahati we had to show a certificate at the border checkpoint (whole process took about an hour)
- we had to again get covid tested in meghalaya local hospital (was like 300 rs and results came on the spot but was very very painful) because we wanted to enter arunachal
3. get winter clothing - cannot stress this enough.
4. don't bother so much about availability in arunachal pradesh in hostels/b&b's but in other states make advance bookings.
5. make advance booking for a cab to arunachal (from meghalaya/guwahati upto you) but on the spot prices are bad (4 days for arunachal was 20k for us). book a big car like a sumo, jeep etc. we did the trip in i20 and a couple of times it was stuck in snow, bad.
we have friends in meghalaya so meghalaya and assam part were just visiting friends and family and exploring nearby places. i will recommend not to miss dawki no matter what. cherrapunji was a disappointment as it was the wrong time of the year to see cloud cover etc.
this report will mainly focus on the arunachal pradesh trip that we(2 friends + driver) covered in 4 days!!
dec 28: shillong to bomdilla - 300 kms at an avg speed of 31 km/hr
pumpkin guest house oyo review - we stayed here in shillong for 3 days, the rooms where cheap some 1k per night for the 2 of us and the rooms and bathrooms are reasonably comfy, good location too. however, the staff take value for money really seriously here. except i think warm water, every other
request was denied by one guy at the reception who manages everything. i think for breakfast he gave me 2 boiled eggs + red tea and said no to bread, omlette and even salt. so don't expect any service.
10 am : leave shillong
2 pm : reached guwahati (where our 4 wheeler car was booked)
3 pm : leave for bomdilla
we covered 300 kms at an average speed of 31 km/hr on this day. we wanted to reach our hostel we booked in bomdilla before midnight but actually we were running way late. plus soon after you leave bhalukpong you gain altitude really fast and the roads start spiralling like crazy and it was sort of 9 pm by the time
we reached bhalukpong, so we were riding very bad terrain in pitch black darkness. but my crazy excitement after entering arunachal was too much (and we had to cover the whole trip in 4 days losing a day wasn't an option) and i kept pushing the driver and we made it to bomdilla by midnight. wouldn't recommend anyone at all to drive that route at night though.
12 pm : 1 km from our hostel we saw that there was a police block. except us like 2 other cars were also stuck. there is apparently some rock cutting going on ahead and roads won't be open till 8 am. there was no warning about this by anyone at all. we did a 180 and started looking for lodging before its too late and only option left
is to sleep in car. we found an amazing place soon although nothing is open by then. the guy gave us proper dinner, a room with heater and comfy bed and blankets and it was all for some 1.5k for the night. this is the most striking feature about arunachal the people are just crazy hospitable. they want
to welcome travellers from their entire heart. we basically stood in front of one of many hotels and it was pitch black no lights and all but we rang the number and someone picked up and did all this for us. i think its a common thing for them, travellers asking for rooms late so they sleep by the phone..by 1 am we had eaten and were asleep.
note: as you enter arunachal there is a very small check that happens where they check if u have ilp.
dec 29: bomdilla to tawang - 170 kms at avg speed of 9.5 km/hr
9 am : breakfast at elegant restaurant. so so cheap and tasty that while returning also we didn't try another restaurant, this one was just perfect.
9 am - 4 pm : this drive from bomdilla to tawang is what the trip is all about. you are driving through beautfil hills with snow capped mountains in the background thinking this is so bful when out of nowhere, a half frozen lake appears. we actually shouted and got out of our car and danced on reaching this lake (at 1 degree celcius) called sela pass .
the beauty of sela pass and the drive both before and after is so bful i will never ever forget it. as you enter tawang there is an army checkpoint where a very detailed check happens. you have to show ilp, verification, covid certificate etc. took 2 hrs at this checkpoint. the army people give you free tea and snacks (like biscuits/samosa etc) and its really something listening to their stories. safe to say my best day of the year 2020 came at the end of the year.
we stayed at dolma khangsar guest house tawang.
dolma khangsar guest house tawang review - very good service, the poeple are very friendly and the rooms shower etc are extremely cozy and well maintained. will recommend it 11/10. the only negative i can think can be the taste of food.
we did a lot of stops in between so we reached this place by about 10 pm.
dec 30: explored tawang, explored the market, visited monastry, pankang teng tso lake - the highest field firing range in the country(4225 m altitude). with the himalayan range in the background, tawang is a must visit. bumla pass was closed for travellers due to border tensions and we missed madhuri lake as we got stuck in the snow once and had to get down and push while coming to p.t.tso and didn't want to risk it going further up. return back to bomdila, stayed at anu's guesthouse
review of anu homestay bomdilla - run by anu, this place is the perfect stop for travellers. cozy rooms and good kitchen services are available, parking is available too. met a lot of fellow backpackers and had an amazing time. it was very cheap as are other places in bomdilla. food was very tasty and cheap too. no complaints.
dec 31: bomdilla to guwahati - 217 kms at 38 km/hr
left bomdilla early morning, reached guwahati by 4 pm. we made sure not to do a road travel at night.
note on the locals : never met more hospitable and welcoming people than arunachal pradesh locals in india. i loved the food there too. they all shut shop at 6 pm, live a simple enough life. they have an appreciation for the beauty that sorrounds them and they want others to experience it too - thats why i will wanna revisit sometime in life.
note on the roads : you can either take tezpur -> bhalukpong -> bomdilla route which we took while coming or the tenga valley -> samteng -> bhairabkunda -> orang route which we took while going back. the roads in the second route is 10 times better than first and i will never repeat the mistake of following the first route. it was a nightmare, there was rocky road and construction every 2 kms and there was km's of strectches of very bad road. plus it was very late at night and dark and you gain altitude very fast in that route too many hairpin bends.
because of the construction on that route, it may be built by the time the reader travels but i highly recommend to take the second route. there was a bit of snowfall on 30th dec night so there was some snow (not a lot) while coming from tawang but still very risky in such narrow roads. driving there without an experienced driver is a strict no.
note on the drinks : if you try local ara, do not take more than 2 shots together :p
overall, my best trip in india so far and would go again in a heartbeat

hope all are safe and well. me and my wife, in late 30s, plan to travel to india in july 2021 for friends wedding (if all vaccination and all is done). we want to explore india and one of the places that came up is rajasthan.
i am seeing mixed reviews on the weather... some places mention july is the best time (due to onset of monsoon) whereas others suggest it may be too hot (95+ f) and not the best time to visit.
we want to spend around 7 days. we have jaipur/ jodhpur/ udaipur in mind. we are flexible to add or remove destinations but want to make our trip comfortable.
we are from boston ma and 95f may become too bad?
anyone recently traveled to rajasthan around july? if this is not the best place to visit, where else could we go in india?

thanks ","hi folks,
i am planning a solo trip to kashmir from jan, 14th to 26th. since i am traveling solo, i would prefer to stay in hostels or maybe homestays which don't cost me a lot and prefer to travel by shared taxis or buses wherever possible. i plan to cover srinagar, pahalgam, aru, betaab and lidder valley, gulmarg, sonmarg, yusmarg, and aherbal.
-- would all these places be open during that time because of snowfall and all?
-- would it be possible to find a budget-friendly place to stay and travel by shared taxis or buses to all these places?
-- i could also take around a week skiing course in gulmarg and cut the travel to some of the places. how much it would cost to take such a skiing course?
-- i am looking for suggestions on some offbeat places worth exploring to avoid the crowd and immerse myself in the local culture.

we skipped scuba and did seawalking in havelock and glass boat ride / snorkeling in neil (off bharatpur beach) and enjoyed both. it depends on the time you have in hand in either place. scuba - many prefer havelock.
the key deciding factor on when to go for undersea activity: the weather on a given day for high under water visibility - my suggestion if an earlier day has sunny bright weather devoid of clouds, go. do not wait for the location - you are on a short tight schedule and you cant do it over again!
if you go by makruzz the actual travel time is about 90 minutes pb - hl. hl-nl and nl to pb should be about 60+ mins. government ferries take much longer. the check in process is more complex now and may need you to report 90-120 minutes earlier depending on the current regulations - security checks, checking in, verification of covid negative report, handing over baggage.
collecting baggage on arrival would take another 30 mins.- it was a chaotic process.
you can book sound and light show online - some museums also i guess - checkout what is available to pre-book

water sports can be booked on the spot - scuba one day earlier preferably",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g297583-i9941-k13479495-Itinerary_for_6D_in_Andaman_and_Nicobar-Andaman_and_Nicobar_Islands.html,Itinerary for 6D in Andaman and Nicobar,ravi_vee,Galaxy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ravi_vee?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,50,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,50,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,50,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,50,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,50,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,200,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,200,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,52500,"[""['radhanagar',"", ""'beach',"", ""'famous',"", ""'pristine',"", ""'sand',"", ""'sunset',"", ""'afternoon',"", ""'3pm',"", ""'530',"", ""'till',"", ""'sunsets',"", ""'felt',"", ""'worth',"", ""'least',"", ""'4',"", ""'5',"", ""'hours',"", ""'kid',"", ""'play',"", ""'folks',"", ""'rush',"", ""'skip',"", ""'scuba',"", ""'seawalking',"", ""'havelock',"", ""'glass',"", ""'boat',"", ""'ride',"", ""'snorkel',"", ""'neil',"", ""'bharatpur',"", ""'beach',"", ""'time',"", ""'hand',"", ""'place',"", ""'scuba',"", ""'many',"", ""'prefer',"", ""'havelock',"", ""'key',"", ""'factor',"", ""'undersea',"", ""'activity',"", ""'weather',"", ""'day',"", ""'high',"", ""'water',"", ""'visibility',"", ""'suggestion',"", ""'earlier',"", ""'day',"", ""'sunny',"", ""'bright',"", ""'weather',"", ""'devoid',"", ""'cloud',"", ""'wait',"", ""'location',"", ""'short',"", ""'tight',"", ""'schedule',"", ""'makruzz',"", ""'actual',"", ""'travel',"", ""'time',"", ""'90',"", ""'minutes',"", ""'pb',"", ""'hl',"", ""'hl',"", ""'nl',"", ""'nl',"", ""'pb',"", ""'60',"", ""'mins',"", ""'government',"", ""'ferry',"", ""'much',"", ""'longer',"", ""'process',"", ""'complex',"", ""'may',"", ""'report',"", ""'90',"", ""'120',"", ""'minutes',"", ""'earlier',"", ""'current',"", ""'regulations',"", ""'security',"", ""'verification',"", ""'covid',"", ""'negative',"", ""'report',"", ""'hand',"", ""'baggage',"", ""'collect',"", ""'baggage',"", ""'arrival',"", ""'30',"", ""'mins',"", ""'chaotic',"", ""'process',"", ""'book',"", ""'sound',"", ""'light',"", ""'show',"", ""'online',"", ""'museums',"", ""'guess',"", ""'checkout',"", ""'pre',"", ""'book',"", ""'water',"", ""'sport',"", ""'book',"", ""'spot',"", ""'scuba',"", ""'one',"", ""'day',"", ""'earlier',"", ""'preferably']""]",False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

each hotel is different in its own way, before you pick the hotel hope you are aware that both these hotels are in different region of nubra, one is in sumur and one in hunder. my recommendation would be to pick a place rather than a hotel. sumur is more green in general, hunder is a little more ""destery"" in my view you should go for something like a cottage for the feel of it. further more nubra is a large valley, by center if you mean a market place- there is none! you should rather consider what you would like to do in nubra...

i am planning a solo trip to kashmir from jan, 14th to 26th. since i am traveling solo, i would prefer to stay in hostels or maybe homestays which don't cost me a lot and prefer to travel by shared taxis or buses wherever possible. i plan to cover srinagar, pahalgam, aru, betaab and lidder valley, gulmarg, sonmarg, yusmarg, and aherbal.
-- would all these places be open during that time because of snowfall and all?
-- would it be possible to find a budget-friendly place to stay and travel by shared taxis or buses to all these places?
-- i could also take around a week skiing course in gulmarg and cut the travel to some of the places. how much it would cost to take such a skiing course?
-- i am looking for suggestions on some offbeat places worth exploring to avoid the crowd and immerse myself in the local culture.
-- what are the regulations for covid for someone arriving at srinagar airport?

i october best weather - less chance rain earlier year, temperatures mid high 20s.","hi dave, as someone has already said, most people don't go to hk for the beaches - but then most people don't usually spend more than a few days in hk and they spend all their time dashing around from one place to another to make sure that they see all the so-called 'must-do's'.
if you're planning to spend 10 days or more there, then i see nothing wrong at all with taking a day or two out to relax on a beach or beside a hotel pool - i've certainly done that myself! hong kong covers an area of over 2700 km², so there's plenty to see and do and over 700km of coastline to find a place to relax, but if you aren't going until next year, you've got loads of time to research and plan all that. if you decided to spend your entire 15 days there, then spending the first couple of days recovering from jetlag beside a hotel pool and the last couple of days lazing on a beach to prepare for the shock of going home, sounds like a good holiday to me!
i would say that october probably has the best weather - less chance of rain than earlier in the year, but still temperatures in the mid to high 20s.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g294217-i1496-k13484834-Best_month_for_the_beach-Hong_Kong.html,Best month for the beach,Xenos,Stockport,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Xenos?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,50,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,50,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,50,0,0,0,50,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,200,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,30000,"[""['dave',"", ""'people',"", ""'hk',"", ""'beach',"", ""'people',"", ""'spend',"", ""'days',"", ""'hk',"", ""'spend',"", ""'time',"", ""'dash',"", ""'one',"", ""'place',"", ""'see',"", ""'call',"", ""'must',"", ""'plan',"", ""'spend',"", ""'10',"", ""'days',"", ""'see',"", ""'wrong',"", ""'day',"", ""'two',"", ""'relax',"", ""'beach',"", ""'beside',"", ""'hotel',"", ""'pool',"", ""'hong',"", ""'kong',"", ""'cover',"", ""'area',"", ""'2700',"", ""'km²',"", ""'plenty',"", ""'see',"", ""'700km',"", ""'coastline',"", ""'place',"", ""'relax',"", ""'arent',"", ""'youve',"", ""'load',"", ""'time',"", ""'research',"", ""'plan',"", ""'spend',"", ""'entire',"", ""'15',"", ""'days',"", ""'spend',"", ""'couple',"", ""'days',"", ""'recover',"", ""'jetlag',"", ""'beside',"", ""'hotel',"", ""'pool',"", ""'couple',"", ""'days',"", ""'laze',"", ""'beach',"", ""'prepare',"", ""'shock',"", ""'home',"", ""'sound',"", ""'good',"", ""'holiday',"", ""'october',"", ""'weather',"", ""'less',"", ""'rain',"", ""'earlier',"", ""'temperatures',"", ""'mid',"", ""'high',"", ""'20s']""]",False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

i point stands, many people included caught booked move scenario explained previous post.
those booked mid last year obviously fall camp frankly given numerous overly optimistic statements boris happy band hopelessly inexperienced sycophants tory tabloids it’s hard pass blame them.
i week holiday malaysia india booked february 2022. booked february 2020, 60th it’s cost house - balance due last week.
to cancel lose £5k pay balance.
this means moment travel agent interest free loan me. idea go, strongly suspect refund policy 90 days date commencement holiday.
i haven’t knowingly booked holiday febrauary 2020 caught “move six months” trap three separate flight bookings cyprus dubai.
i agree chrissie - keep moving keep travel insurance valid maintain original cost flight.
it’s wilful ignorance
for op i’d move september october weather nicer !

i think my point still stands, many people myself included are caught in the booked and move it on scenario as i explained in my previous post.
those that have booked since mid last year obviously fall into the it will be over by 2021 camp and frankly given numerous overly optimistic statements by boris and his happy band of hopelessly inexperienced sycophants and the tory tabloids it’s hard to pass the blame on to them.
i have a 4 week holiday to malaysia and india booked for february 2022. its been booked since february 2020, is for my 60th and it’s cost more than my first house - the balance was due last week.
to cancel would lose £5k and so i had to pay the balance.
this means that at the moment the travel agent has an interest free loan from me. i have no idea if we will get to go, i strongly suspect not and the refund policy is up to 90 days after the date of commencement of the holiday.
i actually haven’t knowingly booked a holiday since febrauary 2020 but i am caught in the “move it on for six months” trap with three separate flight bookings to cyprus and dubai.
i agree with chrissie - i keep moving them on to keep the travel insurance valid and to maintain original cost of flight.
it’s not all about wilful ignorance

sorry i have to ask ... did they say that or is that your judgement? my father in his nineties enjoyed going to beach towns, though he wasn't a 'lay on the beach' kind of guy.
beach towns tend to have breezes which help make hot summer weather far more enjoyable. and a stroll along the beachfront, beats the pants off a stroll down a car clogged city street. realistically unless you require big city amenities (museums, art galleries, big shopping malls), beach communities have everything you need for a long stay.
most bigger beach communities here will have a substantial expat population and along with it, a bit of home comfort, western stores, foreigner oriented menus and such. however you can still go ""local"".
but since you asked about hua hin in particular, i find hua hin to be too modernized and too western for my tastes.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g293916-i3687-k13516582-Bangkok_vs_Singapore_and_Hong_Kong_in_March_May-Bangkok.html,Bangkok vs Singapore and Hong Kong in March-May,Michael P,CA,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/J4939HJmichaelp?tab=forum,0,0,50,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,200,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,50,50,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,200,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,50,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,200,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,50,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,200,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,92500,"[""['folks',"", ""'senior',"", ""'beach',"", ""'sorry',"", ""'judgement',"", ""'father',"", ""'nineties',"", ""'beach',"", ""'towns',"", ""'wasnt',"", ""'lay',"", ""'beach',"", ""'kind',"", ""'guy',"", ""'beach',"", ""'towns',"", ""'tend',"", ""'breeze',"", ""'help',"", ""'hot',"", ""'summer',"", ""'weather',"", ""'far',"", ""'enjoyable',"", ""'stroll',"", ""'beachfront',"", ""'beat',"", ""'pant',"", ""'stroll',"", ""'car',"", ""'clog',"", ""'city',"", ""'street',"", ""'realistically',"", ""'require',"", ""'big',"", ""'city',"", ""'amenities',"", ""'museums',"", ""'art',"", ""'galleries',"", ""'big',"", ""'shop',"", ""'malls',"", ""'beach',"", ""'communities',"", ""'long',"", ""'stay',"", ""'bigger',"", ""'beach',"", ""'communities',"", ""'substantial',"", ""'expat',"", ""'population',"", ""'home',"", ""'comfort',"", ""'western',"", ""'store',"", ""'foreigner',"", ""'orient',"", ""'menus',"", ""'local',"", ""'hua',"", ""'hin',"", ""'particular',"", ""'hua',"", ""'hin',"", ""'modernize',"", ""'western',"", ""'taste']""]",False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

speaking experience good choice little ones. reason little tired wants afternoon nap/time sun, head room sun bathe terrace dip & lagoon pool whilst little sleeps. put travel cot window you’re close enough see hear them.
our room safety gate well chance little wandering pool unattended.
if height summer it’s unlikely you’ll able spend day pool year old.
if isn’t issue look waldorf astoria stunning hotel caesar’s palace i’m sure partner live.
westin good choice well, several kiddies pool within grounds actual kids pool westin large & shaded.
if within budget al naseem madinat also.","have you considered a swim up lagoon pool room at the anantara?
speaking from experience i think these are good choice with little ones. the reason being is when the little one is tired and wants an afternoon nap/time out of the sun, you can head back to the room and sun bathe on your terrace and dip in & out of the lagoon pool whilst the little one sleeps. you can put the travel cot by the window so you’re close enough to see and hear them.
our room had a safety gate as well so no chance of a little one wandering into the pool unattended.
if not in the height of summer it’s unlikely you’ll be able to spend most of the day by the pool with a 1 year old.
if this isn’t an issue then look at waldorf astoria which is a stunning hotel or caesar’s palace which i’m sure your partner will live.
westin is a good choice as well, it has several kiddies pool within its grounds and the actual kids pool at the westin is large & shaded.
if you can get it within budget al naseem at the madinat is great also.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g295424-i872-k13461928-Baby_and_50th_birthday-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html,Baby and 50th birthday,hannahengland,UK,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hannahengland?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,100,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,100,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,100,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,30000,"[""['swim',"", ""'lagoon',"", ""'pool',"", ""'room',"", ""'anantara',"", ""'speak',"", ""'experience',"", ""'good',"", ""'choice',"", ""'little',"", ""'ones',"", ""'reason',"", ""'little',"", ""'one',"", ""'tire',"", ""'afternoon',"", ""'nap',"", ""'time',"", ""'sun',"", ""'head',"", ""'room',"", ""'sun',"", ""'bathe',"", ""'terrace',"", ""'dip',"", ""'lagoon',"", ""'pool',"", ""'whilst',"", ""'little',"", ""'one',"", ""'sleep',"", ""'travel',"", ""'cot',"", ""'window',"", ""'you’re',"", ""'close',"", ""'see',"", ""'hear',"", ""'room',"", ""'safety',"", ""'gate',"", ""'little',"", ""'one',"", ""'wander',"", ""'pool',"", ""'unattended',"", ""'height',"", ""'summer',"", ""'it’s',"", ""'unlikely',"", ""'you’ll',"", ""'able',"", ""'spend',"", ""'day',"", ""'pool',"", ""'1',"", ""'old',"", ""'isn’t',"", ""'waldorf',"", ""'astoria',"", ""'stun',"", ""'hotel',"", ""'caesar’s',"", ""'palace',"", ""'i’m',"", ""'partner',"", ""'live',"", ""'westin',"", ""'good',"", ""'choice',"", ""'kiddies',"", ""'pool',"", ""'ground',"", ""'actual',"", ""'kid',"", ""'pool',"", ""'westin',"", ""'large',"", ""'shade',"", ""'budget',"", ""'al',"", ""'naseem',"", ""'madinat']""]",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

you might want to consider a convenient base for exploring the main tourist sites (world trade centre to business bay area for the first few days - spending a little less on hotel b+b) and then some relaxing when connectivity to transport is less important but a sunny pool is.
shopping around is worth a few hours of your time.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g295424-i872-k13605863-First_timers_advice_on_hotels_areas_costs_etc-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html,first timers/ advice on hotels /areas / costs etc,Sean R,UK,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/275seanr?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,100,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,100,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,100,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,100,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,100,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,100,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,60000,"[""['plot',"", ""'‘to',"", ""'do’',"", ""'map',"", ""'per',"", ""'shaun’s',"", ""'suggestion',"", ""'break',"", ""'stay',"", ""'2',"", ""'chunk',"", ""'sightsee',"", ""'days',"", ""'laze',"", ""'pool',"", ""'convenient',"", ""'base',"", ""'explore',"", ""'main',"", ""'tourist',"", ""'sit',"", ""'world',"", ""'trade',"", ""'centre',"", ""'business',"", ""'bay',"", ""'area',"", ""'days',"", ""'spend',"", ""'little',"", ""'less',"", ""'hotel',"", ""'bb',"", ""'relax',"", ""'connectivity',"", ""'transport',"", ""'less',"", ""'important',"", ""'sunny',"", ""'pool',"", ""'shop',"", ""'worth',"", ""'hours',"", ""'time']""]",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

deira islands is far out for even general sightseeing never mind a night out and if you have a bad weather day you’re kind of stuck with nothing within walking distance.
i’d look around the marina area personally and there’s no need to be all inclusive with ladies nights, promotions etc but i do appreciate dubai can be expensive for alcohol so if you’re really wanting to go all inclusive then look at the following:
amwaj rotana
sheraton jumeirah
movenpick jbr
habtoor grand
dukes the palm
grand hyatt dubai
all of the above offer all inclusive to some extent and i’d pick any of them over riu dubai.
the first three are around the marina area which is ideal location wise but even dukes on the palm and grand hyatt ( which is in the city) are more easily located for getting about and whilst you’ll need taxis from these it’ll be much easier and cheaper!
there are other all inclusive hotels including le meridian mina seyahi (where barasti is located) however they’ll be a lot more price wise than riu.

edited: 7:50 am, january 13,","ive not stayed but would consider it for a long break, ive stayed in their thai hotels and the brand is good and it gets good reviews on here.
the usp is the pools as there at lots of them some with direct access from the rooms - they would be the ones i would want.
ghh is lovely but the pool which is small compared to most will fall into the shade at time times in dec so that will mean you will most def have to go each day across to lrm for pool and beach . that may get a bit relentless after a while and lrm is a busy hotel so it could be a challenge getting 6 loungers mid morning together on the beach or at pool. this would not bother me in the warmer months as the pool is fine in the sunnier days but in dubai winter it may become a issue it can be cold and windy because of the tower blocks blocking out the sun . you wont get that at lrm nor anantara. complete contract very different one will be lovely and hot the other could be chilly.
ghh is a lovely hotel but its a grown ups hotel - its not resort styled more biz orientated , its selling points are its large apartments and food , but i think for what you want and the difference in price anantara would be fine , just be prepared to plan days out as its a way down the palm , but many stay on the palm and are not bothered by that at all - atlantis is a fair old trek off as well. the palm has tons more now than it used to, so def things now on the palm to see and do. id try and get the apartment if possible to have pool access.

“the former water world had only nine outdoor water facilities. its appeal to the local residents was undermined given the fact that some other swimming facilities in hong kong at that time also featured water slides. besides, the former water world only operated from may to september each year, and its attendance was impacted by the persistently weak overall economic condition at that time due to the asian financial crisis in 1998. these all made the operation of the former water world difficult.”",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g294217-i1496-k13637450-Ocean_Park_s_Water_World_opening-Hong_Kong.html,Ocean Park's Water World opening,SolentTraveller,AU,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SolentTraveller?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,100,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,100,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,100,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,100,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,100,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,50000,"[""['official',"", ""'reason',"", ""'ocean',"", ""'park',"", ""'closure',"", ""'former',"", ""'water',"", ""'world',"", ""'legco',"", ""'meet',"", ""'2013',"", ""'environmental',"", ""'impact',"", ""'new',"", ""'water',"", ""'world',"", ""'“the',"", ""'former',"", ""'water',"", ""'world',"", ""'nine',"", ""'outdoor',"", ""'water',"", ""'facilities',"", ""'appeal',"", ""'local',"", ""'residents',"", ""'undermine',"", ""'fact',"", ""'swim',"", ""'facilities',"", ""'hong',"", ""'kong',"", ""'time',"", ""'feature',"", ""'water',"", ""'slide',"", ""'besides',"", ""'former',"", ""'water',"", ""'world',"", ""'operate',"", ""'may',"", ""'september',"", ""'attendance',"", ""'impact',"", ""'persistently',"", ""'weak',"", ""'overall',"", ""'economic',"", ""'time',"", ""'due',"", ""'asian',"", ""'financial',"", ""'crisis',"", ""'1998',"", ""'operation',"", ""'former',"", ""'water',"", ""'world',"", ""'difficult”']""]",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

edited: 4:16 am, april 22,","@peter m, to me 2 weeks in dubai alone would be a little too much. i have been to dubai as a female solo traveller for 7 days about 4 years ago and i felt that it was just nice. i did not visit a.d. but as advised by the others, it might be a good choice to visit there for say, 3 nights or so. on my trip to dubai, i visited the dubai opera, dubai aquarium at the dubai mall, and had dinner near the dubai fountain on day 1. the dubai fountain is beautiful in the evening. on day 2, i went to skydive dubai and dubai miracle garden. on day 3 morning, i went for the desert tour whereby i got to take the 4 x 4 dunes ride and the camel ride. in the afternoon, i took a stroll along the sunset beach where i saw the burj al arab very clearly at the other end. i went to ski dubai on day 4 and it took up almost the whole day. it was my first ski experience and i enjoyed it very much although it was artificial snow. i spent a day at dubai creek on day 5 exploring the old dubai. on day 6, i went to the burj khalifa's observation deck in the morning and talise ottoman hamman spa on the palm in the afternoon. i am still reminiscing the spa i had until now, it was that great! last day was just a rest and relax day strolling around the city area.
i guess it depends what type of solo traveller you are. i think the itinerary i had was a well mix of everything - adventure, heritage and culture, nature at the gardens and beaches, relaxation etc.

if you’re happy to eat indoors in the evening then i think summers in dubai are do-able, hotel prices are reasonable and there’s plenty of western tourists on holiday there.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g295424-i872-k13482819-Weather_in_August-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html,Weather in August,hannahengland,UK,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hannahengland?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,100,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,100,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,100,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,100,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,40000,"[""['cannot',"", ""'sit',"", ""'outside',"", ""'long',"", ""'periods',"", ""'pool',"", ""'august',"", ""'manage',"", ""'fine',"", ""'pool',"", ""'eat',"", ""'lunch',"", ""'shade',"", ""'day',"", ""'manage',"", ""'stroll',"", ""'outside',"", ""'summer',"", ""'long',"", ""'periods',"", ""'30',"", ""'mins',"", ""'it’s',"", ""'subjective',"", ""'question',"", ""'folk',"", ""'flat',"", ""'cannot',"", ""'cope',"", ""'heat',"", ""'humidity',"", ""'summer',"", ""'whereas',"", ""'others',"", ""'high',"", ""'tolerance',"", ""'humidity',"", ""'cope',"", ""'tourist',"", ""'live',"", ""'rarely',"", ""'venture',"", ""'outside',"", ""'anybody',"", ""'misfortune',"", ""'outdoor',"", ""'park',"", ""'height',"", ""'summer',"", ""'tell',"", ""'it’s',"", ""'pleasant',"", ""'steer',"", ""'wheel',"", ""'seat',"", ""'belt',"", ""'boil',"", ""'you’re',"", ""'happy',"", ""'eat',"", ""'indoors',"", ""'summer',"", ""'dubai',"", ""'able',"", ""'hotel',"", ""'price',"", ""'reasonable',"", ""'there’s',"", ""'plenty',"", ""'western',"", ""'tourists',"", ""'holiday']""]",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

you can forget about al fresco dining, but many cool bars (the penthouse, level 43) have their outside terraces open in summer and you can grab a drink or two, especially when the weather is a bit windy (light, somewhat pleasant breeze is a common thing in dubai in august).
of course, all of this is possible in the evening, because during the day it's best to stick to the pool or indoor attractions (although 10-15 mins strolls during the day, e.g. around dubai fountans, also weren't a problem for us). it's also worth mentioning that last year's summer was supposedly one of the coldest in years, so my experience may not be representative :d
that said, everyone reacts differently to extreme heat so it's difficult to say how will you. dubai in summer is still a very popular destination, and given how much cheaper everything is, i would say it's worth a shot. in worst case you will end up just chilling by the pool or in magnificent shopping malls most of the time :d",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g295424-i872-k13482819-Weather_in_August-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html,Weather in August,Gregory K,EU,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/329gregoryk?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,400,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,40000,"[""['dubai',"", ""'august',"", ""'weather',"", ""'problem',"", ""'manage',"", ""'walk',"", ""'30',"", ""'45',"", ""'mins',"", ""'marina',"", ""'jbr',"", ""'problem',"", ""'course',"", ""'tire',"", ""'unpleasant',"", ""'forget',"", ""'al',"", ""'fresco',"", ""'din',"", ""'many',"", ""'cool',"", ""'bar',"", ""'penthouse',"", ""'level',"", ""'43',"", ""'outside',"", ""'terrace',"", ""'open',"", ""'summer',"", ""'grab',"", ""'drink',"", ""'two',"", ""'weather',"", ""'windy',"", ""'light',"", ""'somewhat',"", ""'pleasant',"", ""'breeze',"", ""'common',"", ""'dubai',"", ""'august',"", ""'course',"", ""'day',"", ""'stick',"", ""'pool',"", ""'indoor',"", ""'attractions',"", ""'10',"", ""'15',"", ""'mins',"", ""'stroll',"", ""'day',"", ""'eg',"", ""'dubai',"", ""'fountans',"", ""'werent',"", ""'problem',"", ""'worth',"", ""'summer',"", ""'supposedly',"", ""'one',"", ""'coldest',"", ""'experience',"", ""'may',"", ""'representative',"", ""'react',"", ""'differently',"", ""'extreme',"", ""'heat',"", ""'difficult',"", ""'dubai',"", ""'summer',"", ""'popular',"", ""'destination',"", ""'much',"", ""'cheaper',"", ""'worth',"", ""'shoot',"", ""'worst',"", ""'case',"", ""'end',"", ""'chill',"", ""'pool',"", ""'magnificent',"", ""'shop',"", ""'malls',"", ""'time']""]",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

thank you.i don’t mind at all to be questioned as it’s part of the job but the only thing that made me mention my experience with the border control was that no one around me was questioned as much or so detailed, but hey ho, i’m home now and i’m enjoying the miserable weather - not haha
the flight from dubai to doha was half full and the one from doha to manchester appeared to be half full or maybe a tad more than half. when we chose our seats in economy the middle seat on all rows was greyed out which meant that they tried to socially distance the passengers as much as possible. business class was full but there’s plenty of space there to socially distance.
i think people are still travelling but some airlines, like qatar are restricting numbers to try and give people more space.

it's good to see they're digging into the detail a bit on returnees, even if somewhat arbitrarily.
interesting to see about qatar and their load factors, they were also restricting ticketing ex-uae recently (after you'd bagged yours) and some of the other carriers e.g. saudia are restricting intra-gcc ticketing also.

if you were a first timer or your time was limited then perhaps consider it but given you’re familiar with dubai then i’d recommend a diy exploration otherwise you’re 4 yr old will be bored and even the best behaved little one can start to get irritated after traipsing around the souks in june!
my daughter loved the smccu tour including the mosque visit however she was about 8 and in my opinion the right age to go, any younger boredom will have set in.
alternatively although it will be pricier look at hiring a private tour for half a day. dubai tours, arabian adventures etc they all do them.

if living in london, relative, you may or may not like the big mango. i know my first few visits, i hated it, and thought it nothing more than a giant slum. although, i did stay on lower suk, and didn't explore much. if used to squeaky clean western hygiene (appearance / smells (lack of sewer), then you can easily be put off.
now, after so many visits (100+) and still haven't seen it all, as krung thep metro is huge, i love arriving. and after a short week, i love leaving .... 🤣🤣🤣
being there on weekend has its pros & cons, more festive & more things open, but crowded. if you enjoy just knocking around & exploring a city's non touristy side, you'll love it.
but .... since coming from a big city, if so, and wanting beach time, you may want to prioritize that on first visit, as big city feeling can be found at home. especially coming from uk, as any beach, even thai's crappy ones along with warm weather would be a relief, from what i hear & read.🤣
my first thai beach experience was 20+ years ago, phuket, and got me on thinking about retiring in thailand. trip was actually a recon for retirement. 2nd beach holiday was pp, and sealed the idea.
hindsight, and when thailand opens to 'normal' tourism, i think pp would be my priority, as slow starting up again, before it turns back into a tourist ghetto, i think i'd prioritize my first visit after c19 there. save extensive exploration of the big mango for a later visit, as any changes there, will be for the better as they are revamping some areas already, and quite nicely.
about to revisit pp myself, before 2022, as looking lovely without tourist.
good thing not into ""museums/galleries"" .... they really suck here.

also i live with vulnerable adults so i want to be extra careful and not catch covid. i know 5 people that have just returned and have all caught covid since returning from dubai the day later.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g295424-i872-k13464098-Dubai_beginning_March-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html,Dubai beginning March,Ravi M,UK,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ravim45?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,200,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,50,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,50,0,50,0,0.0,0.0,200,50,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,50000,"[""['flight',"", ""'book',"", ""'dubai',"", ""'begin',"", ""'march',"", ""'uk',"", ""'time',"", ""'dubai',"", ""'unsure',"", ""'latest',"", ""'travel',"", ""'advice',"", ""'cannot',"", ""'travel',"", ""'strict',"", ""'see',"", ""'alot',"", ""'people',"", ""'holiday',"", ""'different',"", ""'date',"", ""'possibly',"", ""'may',"", ""'conscious',"", ""'weather',"", ""'hot',"", ""'dubai',"", ""'day',"", ""'live',"", ""'vulnerable',"", ""'adults',"", ""'extra',"", ""'careful',"", ""'catch',"", ""'covid',"", ""'5',"", ""'people',"", ""'catch',"", ""'covid',"", ""'dubai',"", ""'day']""]",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

i'm not hopeful of being able to travel. if you live with vulnerable adults then i would say you need to put their health above a holiday and consider travelling much later in the year when our uk vaccine programme is more complete and our infection and death rates are much, much lower.

maybe most people, we haven’t been able to dive in over a year, so we did a refresher course the first day off palm jumeirah with nemo’s. we’re pretty experienced divers, 32 dives all over, so no big deal, but they told us the visibility was poor off dubai and they were right. incredibly cloudy and tons of sediment in the water, but we still saw (kinda) a few arabian (asfur) angelfish right off the beach at duke’s when we went around after completing our refresher tasks. fujairah was a really nice dive, we did two dives at dibba rock and artificial reef, they also had nitrox, (or geezer gas), for me. we saw lots of morays, clownfish/anemones, turtles, trunkfish, triggers, pipefish, more asfur angels, some pretty nudibranchs, lots of healthy coral. but the water was pretty cool, i

it’s pool area is a bit disappointing due to being in the shade a lot, if you don’t plan to sunbathe or prefer to get away from summer heat, it might suit you though.
it’s worth noting that summer is low season so it’s possible to book a top hotel for a good price.
have a good shop about and consider what it is you want out of a hotel, i wouldn’t just book it based on price.
how do you plan to get about? the summer months are very hot & humid so it’s worth factoring in it you plan to get the metro, as it’s a bit of a walk from the but the tram stop is nearby .

looking forward hearing staying safe!","so my wife loves to swim but she is really difficult about getting cold (only time she has ever swum in open sea was in phuket in 35 degree weather :) so normally we only ever use heated jacuzzis, untill we stayed at the waldorf in amsterdam where the indoor pool is kept at 30-32 making it perfect for my wife. unfortunately the month after queen we stayed at the waldorf in berlin they didnt have the pool as warm which meant my wife stayed with the jacuzzi as usual. so my question... with january/feb being mild for dubai i understand many places heat their pools but i would guess they might not heat them to the soupy temperature me and my wife is looking for or am i wrong? alternatively are there any places with heated indoor pools? i would prefer staying at a hilton property as i am diamond but i also have gold with ihg, and am open to any other place if they have a pool that could live up to my wife's requirements :)

i understand concern safety i’m quite paranoid comes covid & germs general dubai rta quite stringent measures place hygiene. i’m unsure there’s maximum number passengers allowed, need two taxis you’re sitting face mask sanitising hands touching seat belts, doors you’d feel it’s obviously personal choice.
in honesty & travel anywhere year plan little terms sightseeing avoid crowds, transport much there’s obvious hurdle flight & airport...
edited: 7:02 am, april 25,","if you’ve been to dubai before then you’ll be aware of the standard of driving.... if you feel comfortable then go for it, i drove in dubai for years but i no longer do as the ever changing roads just give me a headache.
my husband drives now when we are there but he does find it stressful at times.
also be mindful if you go anywhere with outdoor parking, getting into a boiling hot car in the summer in dubai that’s been standing a few hours is no fun. touching the seatbelts and steering wheel even less so!!!
i understand your concern re safety as i’m quite paranoid when it comes to covid & germs in general but i think dubai rta has quite stringent measures in place re hygiene. i’m unsure if there’s still a maximum number of passengers allowed, if so then you might need two taxis but if you’re sitting in the back with a face mask on and sanitising your hands after touching seat belts, doors etc i think you’d feel okay but it’s obviously a personal choice.
in all honesty if & when i get to travel anywhere this year i plan to do little in terms of sightseeing and avoid crowds, transport as much as i can but there’s the obvious hurdle of the flight & airport...

maybe for some people. i've been to dubai numerous times and still have no desire to go up there, no matter what floor. it seems at least pre-covid people would just hang up there and block the views and getting there earlier didn't help. i'm like, why pay for a view and people are going to be all in my view? and of course you have to go on the perfect day, or you'll see much of nothing due to the weather conditions.
i'm not sure if you have the ""dubai museum/fort"" on your list of places to go, but i can say, it will give you a good perspective of past and current dubai. it was only one dirham when i went both times. it's basically down the street from al ustad. i was provided a complimentary tour when i arrived the one time. if they have any tours going on, you can just follow the small group around. the tour guides work for the dubai government tourists office. that might be more worth than the visit than a ripleys type setting.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g295424-i872-k13569047-6_day_Itinerary_critique_please-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html,6 day Itinerary critique please!,AA,UK,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SKOOBDO?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,50,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,50,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,50,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,50,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,50,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,200,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,32500,"[""['worth',"", ""'pay',"", ""'148',"", ""'floor',"", ""'burj',"", ""'khalifa',"", ""'move',"", ""'needle',"", ""'experience',"", ""'people',"", ""'dubai',"", ""'numerous',"", ""'time',"", ""'desire',"", ""'matter',"", ""'floor',"", ""'least',"", ""'pre',"", ""'covid',"", ""'people',"", ""'hang',"", ""'block',"", ""'view',"", ""'earlier',"", ""'help',"", ""'pay',"", ""'view',"", ""'people',"", ""'view',"", ""'course',"", ""'perfect',"", ""'day',"", ""'see',"", ""'much',"", ""'due',"", ""'weather',"", ""'dubai',"", ""'museum',"", ""'fort',"", ""'place',"", ""'good',"", ""'perspective',"", ""'past',"", ""'current',"", ""'dubai',"", ""'one',"", ""'dirham',"", ""'time',"", ""'basically',"", ""'street',"", ""'al',"", ""'ustad',"", ""'provide',"", ""'complimentary',"", ""'tour',"", ""'arrive',"", ""'one',"", ""'time',"", ""'tour',"", ""'small',"", ""'group',"", ""'tour',"", ""'guide',"", ""'work',"", ""'dubai',"", ""'government',"", ""'tourists',"", ""'office',"", ""'worth',"", ""'visit',"", ""'ripleys',"", ""'type',"", ""'set']""]",False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

for those levels, consider kagura/naeba instead, about 20 and 50 min respectively by express bus uphill from echigo-yuzawa station, which is served by joetsu shinkansen from tokyo in about 80 min direct.
have skied/stayed there 4 to 5 times. plenty of good runs for those ski levels, apart from great powder from jan.
gala - not enough runs. besides, plenty of beginners at the base where accidents occur. you might finish in half day - similarly in karuizawa.

edited: 4:47 am, april 23,","#8, it is very true. look at hertz car rental. the major mistake it made (according to news reports) was that it did not borrow a large sum of money at the beginning of the pandemic to weather the storm, and was not able to make scheduled loan repayments during the pandemic when the traffic virtually stopped. so it had to file for bankruptcy. it is coming out of bankruptcy now with the same name, but all old equity shareholders were wiped out.
large companies have larger financial obligations and larger losses. united airlines was losing $6 million a day.

indeed, in normal years i usually reserve kyoto hotels at least 5 months in advance, especially for sakura blossoms. another option is to stay in osaka and commute to kyoto daily in about 1 hour. however, the later you book the higher the hotel rates (when cheaper rooms have been snatched up) and possibly in less convenient locations.
rain is a non-issue in either the sakura or koyo season. in general, rainy days cannot be ruled out in any season. however, in those 2 seasons it's due to passing frontal rain resulting in drizzles in a location for at most 2 to 3 days and that's it. it won't be like occasional heavy downpours during the rainy season in late june to mid july or during passing/landing typhoons.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g294232-i525-k13515559-Japan_Honeymoon-Japan.html,Japan Honeymoon,DLi_hk,HK,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DLi_hk?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,200,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,200,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,50,200,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,62500,"[""['spring',"", ""'blossom',"", ""'amaze',"", ""'quite',"", ""'gamble',"", ""'timelines',"", ""'book',"", ""'honeymoon',"", ""'2',"", ""'weeks',"", ""'advance',"", ""'may',"", ""'adventurous',"", ""'indeed',"", ""'normal',"", ""'reserve',"", ""'kyoto',"", ""'hotels',"", ""'least',"", ""'5',"", ""'months',"", ""'advance',"", ""'sakura',"", ""'blossom',"", ""'stay',"", ""'osaka',"", ""'commute',"", ""'kyoto',"", ""'daily',"", ""'1',"", ""'hour',"", ""'book',"", ""'higher',"", ""'hotel',"", ""'rat',"", ""'cheaper',"", ""'room',"", ""'snatch',"", ""'possibly',"", ""'less',"", ""'convenient',"", ""'locations',"", ""'rain',"", ""'non',"", ""'sakura',"", ""'koyo',"", ""'season',"", ""'general',"", ""'rainy',"", ""'days',"", ""'cannot',"", ""'rule',"", ""'season',"", ""'2',"", ""'season',"", ""'due',"", ""'pass',"", ""'frontal',"", ""'rain',"", ""'drizzle',"", ""'location',"", ""'2',"", ""'3',"", ""'days',"", ""'occasional',"", ""'heavy',"", ""'downpours',"", ""'rainy',"", ""'season',"", ""'late',"", ""'june',"", ""'mid',"", ""'july',"", ""'pass',"", ""'land',"", ""'typhoons']""]",False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

thank you also for your suggestion re bus then train from kawaguchi-ko to matsumoto. as i much prefer trains to buses, i was minded to take the fujikyu railway from kawaguchi-ko then change at otsuki and take the ltd exp from there to matsumoto (with a further change at kofu if the timings don't work out for the direct from otsuki to matsumoto). do you think that is a bad idea?

happy planning!","hope you don't mind me butting in here, op, but as a frequent visitor to this part of the alps area (actually coming home 8days ago from there) let me say: roughly speaking, 2 out of 3days are overcast/snowy for the winter months. so chances are you may not be able to soak in the great alpine feel that shin hotaka has to offer. yes, when the weather cooperates, a great reward awaits, where mesmerizing views of the silvery tall peaks get unfolded before your eyes. hate to say this, but the said bus trip doesn't mean much for a first-timer when it doesn't. yet one thing to note is, city of matsumoto is about 1hour train ride away from nagano, in which city (matsumoto) an authentic japanese castle (called black crow castle) welcomes visitors, where exquisitely crafted old interiors together with exhibits like samurai swords and armors sure draw their attention. yes, a photo opportunity too: a couple of young guys clad in samurai armors like to put you in a pic with either of them at the inner entrance. views from the mainkeep are nice, to boot. on a clear day you can see as far as mt yari (not to mention stately mt jonen/otensho/tsubakuro/cho, names of the beauties/tall peaks of the northern japanese alps). should you agree, i suggest you take matsuden tram from matsumoto so you head to shinshimashima by rail. yes, from here, you switch to a nohi bus and it takes you to hirayu (1hr, give or take), an onsen town nestled in this part of the alps and a half-way point on the matsumoto-takayama corridor. along your way is a huge river gorge with scenic dams dotted around. hirayu-takayama is also a 1hr ride, where (though fleeting seconds) you have a chance to be *ohh-ing and ahh-ing* looking at the awesome tall jagged ridgeline of the snow-blanketed hotaka mountains. yes, you can bus it from hirayu to shin hotaka (30min or so), then backtrack and off you go to takayama. view-wise only, matsumoto-takayama wins handsdown, compared to takayama-s'go-kanazawa. yes, all depends on weather.

with said above, shinkanse ride nagano kanazawa godsend hokuriku-goers tokyo/nagano. far combination tram bus rides creature-comfort, matilda. yes, decide direction.
again happy planning!","matilda, am glad if i gave a positive twist to your itinerary. in case you're not sure, matsumoto is pretty straight forward to get to if you take jr from kofu: 1hour-plus train (ltd express) ride away, give or take. so is matsumoto-nagano. see images of matsumoto castle on flickr and give a click to one that takes your fancy so it pops out large: 
looks enticing, no? views from the top is one of a kind. no other castle in japan can afford visitors with as good mountain views, imo. as i said in my last post, you can see as faraway/back as the peak of mt yari (japanese matterhorn).
btw, am i right to assume you are ok (splurging a little bit) for an overnight stay in an onsen ryokan? that type of accommodation galore in hirayu! you can enjoy skiing there too if you wish (almost a stone's-throw away). from the bus station, beautiful snow-blanketed mt kasa and mt norikuras look inviting weather permitting. if allowed, i'd go on suggesting you venture out to (wintertime) kamikochi highland so you capture a gorgeous scene like i did 3winters in a row in the recent past... but that'd take another thread to talk over with, sorry.
roads are icier between hirayu and takayama (particularly so when you're approaching a raised big curve over a huge cliff a couple minutes after departing from hirayu for takayama, where 9000feet peaks loom/tower ahead on your right-hand side) than between shinshimashima and hirayu. but i have never seen/heard about any road accidents around here during winter (when everyone's sticking with safe drive), nor any leg of the road getting closed because of snow. as i said in my last post, you need to ride (in your case: possible aversion to buses) a tram from matsumoto so that you can reach shinshimashima. an interesting ride for first-timers, i reckon, if they like to catch japanese local scenes in the flesh (views plus people, brings a smile on my face when i see apple-red-cheek kids commuting). a tram station like shinshimashima is very small, with a large parkng lot adjacent to it though. so you may feel as if you came to boonies/back o' beyond. yes, there's a cafe right outside the station (signpost saying *kamikochi curry* is their specialty), but i've never seen it open, oh and a veggie/fruit shop across the road from it. and, view-wise, it's not something to write home about, sadly. yes, inside the small complex is a wooden bench- and vending machines-equipped waiting room, oh and a very nice western-style restroom. up until 2summers ago, theirs was as stinky as mountain hut's (sorry but true), but then provided with *toto washlets* talking about the niceties of them requires another thread. ;) (yes, you sure will use ones at your hotels when you come. i remember a first-timer getting panicky in his bathroom and wanting help here on ta years back.) i got dumbfounded when i went in to see the spick'n span men's room at that time! they still looked like pretty much of brand new ones even when i used to ease myself 9days ago from today. the station staff must have been taking mighty good care of them, i gather.
with all of that said above, the shinkanse ride from nagano to kanazawa is a godsend to hokuriku-goers if from tokyo/nagano. it's far better than a combination of tram and bus rides when you think of your creature-comfort, matilda. yes, it's up to you to decide on either direction.

besides, overnight bus is not for everyone - don't expect a good sleep and thus likely being tired the whole day after.
as long as you visit in the morning hours on a clear and calm day, it'd be spectacular.

so the feeling, in only my opinion, is very piccadilly circus/las vegas/times square if you stay on/near princes street. if you like that vibe, you're in luck. shopping, day-drinking (i am 100% not judging as i have enjoyed day-drinking myself), loud acoustical-guitar music, etc.
for boring people like me, i would suggest staying either way further back in the old town section or the new town section. and keep in mind that the balmoral and the waldorf are pc/lv/ts in terms of their locations even though they are expensive.
it was pouring rain most of our visit, but the little bit of rural scotland we saw from the train reminded me of maine. not shocking since the the mountains that end at the coast of maine pick up in scotland. pretty much the same geological thumbprint very roughly speaking (my background is in geology). really lovely.
the castle was booked up our weekend, so we went to the holyrood palace. very calm, not touristy, very pleasant. there was a watercolor exhibit at the queen's gallery next door that we also enjoyed. additionally, we liked the national scottish gallery. it had a nice gift shop and cafe, as well.
we decided that we've been to edinburgh twice: the first time and the last time. we would use e'burgh as a launching spot for a more rural, wilderness visit. but that's just us. apparently, i have rubbed off on my daughter and despite her college antics and interests, she seems to prefer quiet and calm and historical as opposed to shopping and a festival scene; don't assume all people under 25 will love edinburgh.
it was very easy to get to edinburgh from london. the train ride has great vistas if you sit on the coastal side. we booked 1st class for the return trip and it was fun. free sandwiches, chips, wine, sodas, etc. lots of sheep out the window. i saw a small group of deer laying in.a field. very picturesque.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g186525-i108-k13603320-Went_to_Edinburgh-Edinburgh_Scotland.html,Went to Edinburgh...,Melissa R.,0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MelissaR0123?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,100,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,100,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,100,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,100,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,100,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,100,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,100,0,100,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,100,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,100,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,100000,"[""['daughter',"", ""'visit',"", ""'scotland',"", ""'sit',"", ""'eburgh',"", ""'night',"", ""'sun',"", ""'afternoon',"", ""'arrive',"", ""'depart',"", ""'waverly',"", ""'feel',"", ""'opinion',"", ""'piccadilly',"", ""'circus',"", ""'las',"", ""'vegas',"", ""'time',"", ""'square',"", ""'stay',"", ""'near',"", ""'princes',"", ""'street',"", ""'vibe',"", ""'shop',"", ""'day',"", ""'drink',"", ""'100',"", ""'judge',"", ""'day',"", ""'drink',"", ""'loud',"", ""'acoustical',"", ""'guitar',"", ""'music',"", ""'bore',"", ""'people',"", ""'stay',"", ""'way',"", ""'old',"", ""'town',"", ""'section',"", ""'new',"", ""'town',"", ""'section',"", ""'keep',"", ""'mind',"", ""'balmoral',"", ""'waldorf',"", ""'pc',"", ""'lv',"", ""'ts',"", ""'term',"", ""'locations',"", ""'expensive',"", ""'pour',"", ""'rain',"", ""'visit',"", ""'little',"", ""'rural',"", ""'scotland',"", ""'saw',"", ""'train',"", ""'remind',"", ""'maine',"", ""'shock',"", ""'mountains',"", ""'end',"", ""'coast',"", ""'maine',"", ""'pick',"", ""'scotland',"", ""'pretty',"", ""'much',"", ""'geological',"", ""'thumbprint',"", ""'roughly',"", ""'speak',"", ""'background',"", ""'geology',"", ""'castle',"", ""'book',"", ""'weekend',"", ""'holyrood',"", ""'palace',"", ""'calm',"", ""'touristy',"", ""'pleasant',"", ""'watercolor',"", ""'exhibit',"", ""'queen',"", ""'gallery',"", ""'door',"", ""'additionally',"", ""'national',"", ""'scottish',"", ""'gallery',"", ""'gift',"", ""'shop',"", ""'cafe',"", ""'edinburgh',"", ""'twice',"", ""'time',"", ""'time',"", ""'eburgh',"", ""'launch',"", ""'spot',"", ""'rural',"", ""'wilderness',"", ""'visit',"", ""'apparently',"", ""'rub',"", ""'daughter',"", ""'despite',"", ""'college',"", ""'antic',"", ""'interest',"", ""'prefer',"", ""'quiet',"", ""'calm',"", ""'historical',"", ""'oppose',"", ""'shop',"", ""'festival',"", ""'scene',"", ""'assume',"", ""'people',"", ""'25',"", ""'edinburgh',"", ""'easy',"", ""'edinburgh',"", ""'london',"", ""'train',"", ""'ride',"", ""'vistas',"", ""'sit',"", ""'coastal',"", ""'side',"", ""'book',"", ""'1st',"", ""'class',"", ""'trip',"", ""'fun',"", ""'free',"", ""'sandwich',"", ""'chip',"", ""'wine',"", ""'sodas',"", ""'lot',"", ""'sheep',"", ""'window',"", ""'saw',"", ""'small',"", ""'group',"", ""'deer',"", ""'lay',"", ""'ina',"", ""'field',"", ""'picturesque']""]",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

- perth - lady marys walk, or the leisure centre if weather is bad.
- anything around loch tay or the forest there? kids have wetsuits and could maybe try kayaking or paddleboarding if there is something recommended.
i will also ensure i myself, go on a whiskey tour, looking at blair athol and possibly doing one of the munroes - schiehallion perhaps.
thanks for any suggestions.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g186564-i1348-k13622489-Family_activites-Perth_and_Kinross_Scotland.html,Family activites,sterankin,Belfast,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sterankin?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,50,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,200,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,50,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,50,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,50,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,30000,"[""['minute',"", ""'trip',"", ""'perth',"", ""'kinross',"", ""'week',"", ""'2',"", ""'kid',"", ""'age',"", ""'9',"", ""'7',"", ""'try',"", ""'4',"", ""'day',"", ""'stay',"", ""'stay',"", ""'near',"", ""'bankfoot',"", ""'outside',"", ""'perth',"", ""'try',"", ""'mix',"", ""'outdoor',"", ""'activities',"", ""'potential',"", ""'indoor',"", ""'ones',"", ""'weather',"", ""'bad',"", ""'hop',"", ""'local',"", ""'guidance',"", ""'concern',"", ""'may',"", ""'book',"", ""'ideas',"", ""'crief',"", ""'hydro',"", ""'good',"", ""'place',"", ""'spend',"", ""'half',"", ""'day',"", ""'indoor',"", ""'blair',"", ""'drummond',"", ""'safari',"", ""'park',"", ""'perth',"", ""'lady',"", ""'marys',"", ""'walk',"", ""'leisure',"", ""'centre',"", ""'weather',"", ""'bad',"", ""'loch',"", ""'tay',"", ""'forest',"", ""'kid',"", ""'wetsuits',"", ""'try',"", ""'kayak',"", ""'paddleboarding',"", ""'something',"", ""'recommend',"", ""'ensure',"", ""'whiskey',"", ""'tour',"", ""'blair',"", ""'athol',"", ""'possibly',"", ""'one',"", ""'munroes',"", ""'schiehallion',"", ""'suggestions']""]",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

you’ll find you spend a lot of time watching the race on the big screens (or your ipad) as well as what’s in front of you so a decent view of a screen is important - silverstone is pancake flat so seeing across the circuit is near impossible). high up won’t achieve much more viewing and puts you i bit further from the action, the win is that if it’s raining you’ll be drier and if it’s blazing sun there’s some shade - i doubt it matters but i’d want to be a dozen rows back from the front to cover weather extremes.
a f1 race is a relatively long event and there’s no natural ‘half time’ so from drivers parade to the end will take its toll on the bladders of the folk who go to the race with a few (or a lot of) beers (and there will be quite a few of them). if you sit at the end of a row you’ll be jumping up to let them visit the facilities with monotonous regularity, if you sit in the middle it will be a struggle if you get the call of nature. your choice!

thanks for your help!",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g186243-i848-k13636548-Surfboard_hire-St_Ives_Cornwall_England.html,surfboard hire,Sonya W,0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sonyaw2021?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,300,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,134,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,38978,"[""['visit',"", ""'st',"", ""'ives',"", ""'2',"", ""'weeks',"", ""'21',"", ""'august',"", ""'town',"", ""'time',"", ""'hire',"", ""'surf',"", ""'board',"", ""'plenty',"", ""'surf',"", ""'hire',"", ""'place',"", ""'dwindle',"", ""'recent',"", ""'hire',"", ""'soft',"", ""'top',"", ""'board',"", ""'town',"", ""'town',"", ""'right',"", ""'roof',"", ""'gear',"", ""'tie',"", ""'top',"", ""'car',"", ""'hire',"", ""'1',"", ""'2',"", ""'weeks',"", ""'daily',"", ""'collect',"", ""'basis',"", ""'help']""]",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

edited: 5:19 am, yesterday","when we visit london we often take a trip to brighton. you really need a full day but it might be a welcome change.
the royal pavilion is well worth a visit and it is worth checking what is currently on display. weather depending, there are some pleasant walks along the beach, along the pier and in the direction of the marina. the lanes offers a number of small shops, for the more interesting and quirky, then the north laine is a must.
the journey is pleasant, we tend to take the thameslink from st pancras rather than southern from victoria. it's a little over an hour and the trains are generally quiet, even over a weekend. we have found that they lay on trains with many more carriages than needed so you're guaranteed to find a quiet and relatively empty space.
it's a relatively short walk down the hill from the station to the main part of town. there are buses which may be desirable on the way back up the hill depending on the weather and how exhausting the day has been..
whatever you decide to do, enjoy!

630,3922,0,"day trips fort william - plenty choice!
i'd look glencoe glen etive (the latter glen used skyfall filming happens) - look going chairlift decent weather day; short walk takes magnificent viewpoint all, including top ben nevis clear.
some photos it: 
if chairlift appeal gondola nevis range walk too.it's good view match character glencoe.
drive glen etive far wish; beautiful glen summer, quite busy informal campers.
i recommend part day, drive round kinlochleven loop - views stunning missed many people hurtling a82.the lochleven seafood cafe good.the little glencoe cafe village scenic location nice food/cakes. said there's location food view kingshouse hotel near ski centre. eaten though.
if gentle strolls thing, glencoe lochan fits bill; uphill, waterfall walk (when rivers got higher again!) kinlochleven.
getting arisaig camusdarach beaches makes good day could carry see something skye nipping ferry armadale (book well advance.)even seeing south skye/sleat (perhaps lunch hotel eilean iarmain hotel/bar) well worth it.views fantastic.
you could corran ferry see something ardnamurchan, beautiful peninsula, perhaps going far salen. kilcamb lodge hotel gem good food options there. cut acharacle, walk castle tioram lovely easy too.
you loop, driving, part longer day takes camusdarach.
arisaig shearwater boat goes eigg day trip - beautiful island, well worth seeing.bikes hire little bus used people gorgeous singing sands - check first.
check route description steall falls walk ensure - rocky places underfoot steep gorge people i'm sure find dry weather. takes nice spot.
further north urquhart castle gets pounding forum - early beat rush hour speak. spot.loch ness beautiful loch nicest end fort augustus nice wee place good views.various lunch options look popping glengarry castle hotel.pricey lunch good tea cakes gorgeous setting.
starters 10","4 day trips from fort william - plenty of choice!
i'd look at glencoe and glen etive for one (the latter glen used in skyfall filming as it happens) - look at going up the chairlift on a decent weather day; a short walk from there takes you to a magnificent viewpoint over all, including the top of ben nevis if clear.
some photos from it: 
if a chairlift doesn't appeal you can also go up the gondola at nevis range and there is a walk you can do from there too.it's a good view but to me doesn't match in character what you get from glencoe.
drive down glen etive as far as you wish; it's a beautiful glen though in summer, quite busy with informal campers.
i would always recommend as part of that day, a drive round the kinlochleven loop - views are stunning and it's missed out by so many people hurtling up the a82.the lochleven seafood cafe is very good.the little glencoe cafe in the village isn't in the most scenic location but it does nice food/cakes. that said there's probably no better location for food with a view than the kingshouse hotel up near the ski centre. haven't eaten there yet though.
if gentle strolls are the thing, the glencoe lochan fits the bill; uphill, there is a waterfall walk (when rivers have got higher again!) at kinlochleven.
getting out to arisaig and the camusdarach beaches makes for a good day out and you could carry on and see something of skye by nipping over on the ferry to armadale (book well in advance.)even seeing some of south skye/sleat (perhaps lunch at the hotel eilean iarmain hotel/bar) would be well worth it.views are fantastic.
you could also go over on the corran ferry to see something of ardnamurchan, a beautiful peninsula, perhaps going just as far as salen. the kilcamb lodge hotel is a gem and does good food but there are other options out there. if you cut through to acharacle, a walk to castle tioram is lovely and easy too.
you can also do that loop, with more driving, as part of a longer day that takes in camusdarach.
arisaig is also where the shearwater boat goes over to eigg as a day trip - beautiful island, well worth seeing.bikes for hire and a little bus used to take people to the gorgeous singing sands - but check first.
check out the route description for the steall falls walk to ensure it's ok for you - it is a bit rocky in places underfoot above a steep gorge though most people i'm sure find it ok in dry weather. it takes you to a nice spot.
further north is urquhart castle which gets a pounding on the forum but i like it - if you can get there early to beat the rush hour so to speak. it's in a great spot.loch ness isn't our most beautiful loch but it's nicest end is at fort augustus which is a nice wee place in itself with good views.various lunch options there or look at popping in to the glengarry castle hotel.pricey for lunch but does good tea and cakes in a gorgeous setting.

looks like you had great fun - snow looks great.
have never skiied in norikura kogen, though the slalom run there looks tempting - apart from its onsen up on 1400m.
shiga kogen - great shots of the northern jp alps range in the distance. skied once only in 2013 and terakoya, ichinose pistes were some of our fav.
hakuba happo-one - also stayed in hakuba tokyu hotel once in jan 2018 when my wife joined (not skiing though). in that year snow was like showering 50cm daily and the mountains were hardly visible for the few days we stayed. next time i'd also look for kashima-yari, jiigatake (on clear days) when taking the topmost ski lift.

love it - and love your description of photoing night shots without a tripod.
the monster looks to me like what we see out our back windows: giant hemlock trees heavily laden with new fallen snow. fortunately for our trees the snow doesn't stay on the branches too long or it would result in them being permanently deformed, or worse - they might break from the weight of the wet snow.
thanks again for sharing your photo and your ski trip.

btw, for onsen accommodation, takamagahara comes to my mind (ichinose’s next-door neighbor yet actually connected with each other). you may like to see this: 
onsen waters, if they tried to dig them out in the ground, would perhaps be found in oku shiga, so says their japanese homepage, but they don’t because of the protection of their natural environment.

i think i know how an avid skier like you is now feeling. (would drive me crazy if it was me.) no harm meant, and i'm not really sure, but rather than go to fulong (the next winter olympic venue), hakuba/shiga kogen (natural powders, not artificial ones, galore) sure looks to be a better bet in a case like yours. so i hope japan can open her doors to overseas skiers, come next season. yes, i did see a group of young english-speaking boarders in yakebi; a tall and fair-haired blue-eyed middle-aged solo skier in 47; french-speaking family skiers, young and energetic english-speaking slalomers, and a spaniard (instrunctor) in happo one. but they should all be japan residents, i imagine. so would be nice if things went better soon.

agree it’s better to drop matsuyama and takamatsu this time. there are many interesting places in mainland honshu that are worth going for a couple of days. if cherry blossom is a main objective consider spending more time in osaka and kyoto. in average year your time of visit is in season and there are many beautiful sakura sites in and around osaka and kyoto. we took in some during our spring visit to the kansai region in 2019. do let me know if you are interested and i can elaborate a bit more.
another place often neglected is nagoya which to most is just a transport hub for train travel. a highly worthwhile side trip is the spectacular illumination event in the flower park of nabana-no-sato which is an easy evening excursion if you are staying a night in nagoya.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g294232-i525-k13542015-4_weeks_in_March_2022_second_trip-Japan.html,4 weeks in March 2022 (second trip),William512,CA,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/William512?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,100,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,100,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,100,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,30000,"[""['drive',"", ""'fuji',"", ""'five',"", ""'lakes',"", ""'region',"", ""'fine',"", ""'twice',"", ""'spring',"", ""'fall',"", ""'slightly',"", ""'traffic',"", ""'autumn',"", ""'foliage',"", ""'plan',"", ""'mid',"", ""'april',"", ""'good',"", ""'time',"", ""'kawaguchiko',"", ""'cherry',"", ""'blossom',"", ""'beautiful',"", ""'pink',"", ""'moss',"", ""'kawaguchiko',"", ""'hold',"", ""'annual',"", ""'sakura',"", ""'festival',"", ""'time',"", ""'frame',"", ""'weather',"", ""'permit',"", ""'course',"", ""'it’s',"", ""'drop',"", ""'matsuyama',"", ""'takamatsu',"", ""'time',"", ""'many',"", ""'interest',"", ""'place',"", ""'mainland',"", ""'honshu',"", ""'worth',"", ""'couple',"", ""'days',"", ""'cherry',"", ""'blossom',"", ""'main',"", ""'objective',"", ""'spend',"", ""'time',"", ""'osaka',"", ""'kyoto',"", ""'average',"", ""'time',"", ""'visit',"", ""'season',"", ""'many',"", ""'beautiful',"", ""'sakura',"", ""'sit',"", ""'osaka',"", ""'kyoto',"", ""'spring',"", ""'visit',"", ""'kansai',"", ""'region',"", ""'2019',"", ""'interest',"", ""'elaborate',"", ""'place',"", ""'neglect',"", ""'nagoya',"", ""'transport',"", ""'hub',"", ""'train',"", ""'travel',"", ""'highly',"", ""'worthwhile',"", ""'side',"", ""'trip',"", ""'spectacular',"", ""'illumination',"", ""'event',"", ""'flower',"", ""'park',"", ""'nabana',"", ""'sato',"", ""'easy',"", ""'excursion',"", ""'stay',"", ""'night',"", ""'nagoya']""]",True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

thank much insight.","my boyfriend and i booked flights on a whim... and then started researching and feel like we are totally overwhelmed (we don’t know much about japan but can’t wait to go!)
where do i begin? i got some guidebooks, but there is so much info on them that covers the entire country... i feel like i should nail down the regions were visiting before i start researching because otherwise there’s just too much information.

hoping to hit up the south/west when it might still be somewhat warm and see some fall colors, then head north/east (who knows if it will be snowing by then, which could be cool).
we usually like to spend at least three days in a location, so we could probably hit up four regions?
i don’t even know 100% that the trip will happen because of covid - of course it will all depend on what state the world (and japan) is it at the time. i am hopeful though.

""due to the 3.11 earthquake occurred in march 11, 2011, we lost two of three ships. fortunately, however, we can enjoy cruising on the last one with you! we really appreciate your warm support. please enjoy the beauty and the strength of the nature surrounding jodogahama beach, which was never lost even in the disaster.""",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g1022873-i14313-k13471017-Tsunami_Inundation_signs-Miyako_Iwate_Prefecture_Tohoku.html,Tsunami Inundation signs,Bargainhunter,US,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bargainhunter?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,50,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,50,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,200,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,50,0.0,0.0,0,0,50,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,30000,"[""['comment',"", ""'relate',"", ""'miyako',"", ""'iwate',"", ""'prefecture',"", ""'miyako',"", ""'island',"", ""'end',"", ""'japan',"", ""'okinawa',"", ""'see',"", ""'rock',"", ""'formations',"", ""'jodogahama',"", ""'beach',"", ""'stay',"", ""'miyako',"", ""'view',"", ""'sightsee',"", ""'boat',"", ""'town',"", ""'suffer',"", ""'greatly',"", ""'2011',"", ""'earthquake',"", ""'tsunami',"", ""'2016',"", ""'brochure',"", ""'jodogahama',"", ""'beach',"", ""'sightsee',"", ""'boat',"", ""'due',"", ""'311',"", ""'earthquake',"", ""'occur',"", ""'march',"", ""'11',"", ""'2011',"", ""'lose',"", ""'two',"", ""'three',"", ""'ship',"", ""'fortunately',"", ""'cruise',"", ""'one',"", ""'warm',"", ""'support',"", ""'beauty',"", ""'strength',"", ""'nature',"", ""'surround',"", ""'jodogahama',"", ""'beach',"", ""'lose',"", ""'disaster']""]",True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

677,4017,JP,">>a) jr rail pass, tokyo metro 72 hour pass beneficial save money? see kyoto offers similar bus subway pass.
if leave japan osaka kansai airport, need jr pass all. passes pay well.
except traveling round trip tokyo - nikko/nasushiobara, save little jr tokyo wide pass  save include ride narita airport - tokyo ltd. exp. narita express tokyo - kawaguchiko ltd. exp. fuji excursion within 3-day window.
>>b) wish goshuin, times days, shrines temples open? shrine temple recommendations appreciated.
shrines temples usually closing day. opening time available official sites.
for day 5, worth spending whole day nasu visiting sesshoseki. temples shrines + nature stuffs, nikko bundle attractions.
btw, understand goshuin ""the prove sincere worship"", collection rare stamps. :)
>>c) day 7- recommendation hotel good view mt fuji, assuming weather cooperating. wish stay lake ashinoko area?
if want view mt fuji room, look kawaguchiko, hakone. visiting kawaguchiko stay night there, explore hakone next day instead.
also, quite number ryokans hakone kawaguchiko offer private hot springs (in room private bath house) limit choice two. jalan  filter ryokans.",">>a) will the jr rail pass, tokyo metro 72 hour pass be beneficial and save us money? i also see that kyoto offers a similar bus and subway pass.
if you can leave japan from osaka kansai airport, then you do not need a jr pass at all. most of the passes does not pay off as well.
except if you are traveling round trip tokyo - nikko/nasushiobara, then you can save a little bit with jr tokyo wide pass  you can save more if you can include the ride narita airport - tokyo on ltd. exp. narita express or tokyo - kawaguchiko on ltd. exp. fuji excursion within the 3-day window.
>>b) as we wish to do goshuin, how do we know the times and days, shrines and temples are open? any shrine or temple recommendations will be appreciated.
shrines and temples are usually do not have closing day. opening time are available on their official sites.
for day 5, i don't think it is worth spending a whole day to nasu just visiting sesshoseki. if you like temples and shrines + nature stuffs, i think nikko can give you a better bundle of attractions.
btw, hope you understand that goshuin is ""the prove of your sincere worship"", not the collection of rare stamps. :)
>>c) on day 7- any better recommendation for hotel with a good view of mt fuji, assuming the weather is cooperating. we wish to stay in the lake ashinoko area?
if you want a better view of mt fuji from room, where you should look for is kawaguchiko, not hakone. so i would suggest you visiting kawaguchiko and stay 1 night there, and explore hakone on the next day instead.
also, there are quite a number of ryokans in hakone and kawaguchiko do offer private hot springs (in room one or private bath house) so you don't have to limit your choice to just one or two. you can use jalan  to filter those ryokans.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g294232-i525-k13582338-Japan_2_weeks_2023_advice-Japan.html,Japan 2 weeks 2023 advice,HiroSKMT,CN,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HiroSKMT?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,50,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,50,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,200,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,200,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,50,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,47500,"[""['jr',"", ""'rail',"", ""'pass',"", ""'tokyo',"", ""'metro',"", ""'72',"", ""'hour',"", ""'pass',"", ""'beneficial',"", ""'save',"", ""'money',"", ""'see',"", ""'kyoto',"", ""'similar',"", ""'bus',"", ""'subway',"", ""'pass',"", ""'japan',"", ""'osaka',"", ""'kansai',"", ""'airport',"", ""'jr',"", ""'pass',"", ""'pass',"", ""'pay',"", ""'except',"", ""'travel',"", ""'round',"", ""'trip',"", ""'tokyo',"", ""'nikko',"", ""'nasushiobara',"", ""'save',"", ""'little',"", ""'jr',"", ""'tokyo',"", ""'wide',"", ""'pass',"", ""'save',"", ""'include',"", ""'ride',"", ""'narita',"", ""'airport',"", ""'tokyo',"", ""'ltd',"", ""'exp',"", ""'narita',"", ""'express',"", ""'tokyo',"", ""'kawaguchiko',"", ""'ltd',"", ""'exp',"", ""'fuji',"", ""'excursion',"", ""'3',"", ""'day',"", ""'window',"", ""'b',"", ""'wish',"", ""'goshuin',"", ""'time',"", ""'days',"", ""'shrine',"", ""'temples',"", ""'open',"", ""'shrine',"", ""'temple',"", ""'recommendations',"", ""'shrine',"", ""'temples',"", ""'close',"", ""'day',"", ""'open',"", ""'time',"", ""'official',"", ""'sit',"", ""'day',"", ""'5',"", ""'worth',"", ""'spend',"", ""'whole',"", ""'day',"", ""'nasu',"", ""'visit',"", ""'sesshoseki',"", ""'temples',"", ""'shrine',"", ""'nature',"", ""'stuff',"", ""'nikko',"", ""'bundle',"", ""'attractions',"", ""'btw',"", ""'goshuin',"", ""'prove',"", ""'sincere',"", ""'worship',"", ""'collection',"", ""'rare',"", ""'stamp',"", ""'c',"", ""'day',"", ""'7',"", ""'recommendation',"", ""'hotel',"", ""'good',"", ""'view',"", ""'mt',"", ""'fuji',"", ""'assume',"", ""'weather',"", ""'cooperate',"", ""'wish',"", ""'stay',"", ""'lake',"", ""'ashinoko',"", ""'area',"", ""'view',"", ""'mt',"", ""'fuji',"", ""'room',"", ""'kawaguchiko',"", ""'hakone',"", ""'visit',"", ""'kawaguchiko',"", ""'stay',"", ""'1',"", ""'night',"", ""'explore',"", ""'hakone',"", ""'day',"", ""'instead',"", ""'quite',"", ""'number',"", ""'ryokans',"", ""'hakone',"", ""'kawaguchiko',"", ""'private',"", ""'hot',"", ""'spring',"", ""'room',"", ""'one',"", ""'private',"", ""'bath',"", ""'house',"", ""'limit',"", ""'choice',"", ""'one',"", ""'two',"", ""'jalan',"", ""'filter',"", ""'ryokans']""]",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

sorry to be getting to the thread so late in the discussion. i too recommend staying at least a night at kawaguchiko, if for no other reason than you have a better chance for clear skies if you have 2 rather than 1 day.
chureito pagoda is fine if the weather be clear, otherwise don't bother. also rather than taking the stairs as dli_hk says, you can walk up the road for vehicles which we found to be much easier than the stairs.
whatever you do, be sure to check one of the live cams before heading out - and even then things can get cloudy fast:


and we recommend the momiji tunnel more than the momiji corridor for spectacular views (and photo ops) of fuji in a “tunnel view” through koyo (or sakura)
see this article -

and scroll down to the photo with the caption “a beautiful view of mt. fuji from lake kawaguchi with autumn foliage.l”
read the paragraph below the photo, beginning “if you have time and are keen to make your koyo viewing of mt. fuji complete i suggest that you visit the momiji tunnel. visitors often get the momiji corridor and the tunnel mixed up, and i was actually confused about the difference before consulting a helpful clerk at the information desk at kawaguchi station.”
if you want further info on getting to the momiji tunnel, just ask i’d be happy to help.

for hiroshima, i'd recommend you either stay in miyajima (aka itsukushima) or stay somewhere landside that's not far from the ferry terminal. you really want to spend a fully day there; it's magical. and it gets better in the evenings as well as early morning, when it's utterly devoid of the hordes of daytrippers. by the way, even though the main torii gate is completely covered up due to renovation, it's still an amazing place to visit.
on the way from kanazawa to takayama, i strongly suggest you swing by shirakawa-go (gokayama); it's especially gorgeous in the winter months when snow envelops the gassho-style thatched roof houses there.
the only other thing i'd suggest would be to spend a fully day in nara. while kyoto is amazing, in many ways we enjoyed nara even more. and i'm not talking about the deer park (to me, that's a waste of time unless your kids enjoy interacting with animals.) the historic sights are completely different in look, feel and historical significance compared to kyoto's main attractions - i highly encourage you check it out!",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g294232-i525-k13506436-First_trip_to_Japan_advice_on_2_5_weeks_itinerary-Japan.html,First trip to Japan - advice on 2.5 weeks itinerary,KI-NRT,US,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KI-NRT?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,100,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,100,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,100,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,100,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,100,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,50000,"[""['oreo',"", ""'itinerary',"", ""'place',"", ""'plan',"", ""'visit',"", ""'detail',"", ""'specific',"", ""'suggestions',"", ""'interest',"", ""'temples',"", ""'culture',"", ""'food',"", ""'nature',"", ""'hike',"", ""'people',"", ""'watch',"", ""'budget',"", ""'help',"", ""'narrow',"", ""'instance',"", ""'kyotos',"", ""'top',"", ""'sight',"", ""'cluster',"", ""'one',"", ""'area',"", ""'ton',"", ""'awesome',"", ""'areas',"", ""'walkable',"", ""'bunch',"", ""'place',"", ""'require',"", ""'bus',"", ""'train',"", ""'taxis',"", ""'time',"", ""'efficiently',"", ""'taxi',"", ""'route',"", ""'advisable',"", ""'3',"", ""'full',"", ""'day',"", ""'kyoto',"", ""'itinerary',"", ""'hiroshima',"", ""'recommend',"", ""'stay',"", ""'miyajima',"", ""'aka',"", ""'itsukushima',"", ""'stay',"", ""'landside',"", ""'far',"", ""'ferry',"", ""'terminal',"", ""'spend',"", ""'fully',"", ""'day',"", ""'magical',"", ""'early',"", ""'morning',"", ""'utterly',"", ""'devoid',"", ""'hordes',"", ""'daytrippers',"", ""'way',"", ""'main',"", ""'torii',"", ""'gate',"", ""'completely',"", ""'cover',"", ""'due',"", ""'renovation',"", ""'amaze',"", ""'place',"", ""'visit',"", ""'way',"", ""'kanazawa',"", ""'takayama',"", ""'strongly',"", ""'swing',"", ""'shirakawa',"", ""'gokayama',"", ""'gorgeous',"", ""'winter',"", ""'months',"", ""'snow',"", ""'envelop',"", ""'gassho',"", ""'style',"", ""'thatch',"", ""'roof',"", ""'house',"", ""'spend',"", ""'fully',"", ""'day',"", ""'nara',"", ""'kyoto',"", ""'amaze',"", ""'many',"", ""'ways',"", ""'nara',"", ""'talk',"", ""'deer',"", ""'park',"", ""'waste',"", ""'time',"", ""'kid',"", ""'interact',"", ""'animals',"", ""'historic',"", ""'sight',"", ""'completely',"", ""'different',"", ""'feel',"", ""'historical',"", ""'significance',"", ""'kyotos',"", ""'main',"", ""'attractions',"", ""'highly',"", ""'encourage']""]",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

","overall your itin looks fine and well planned.
better drop by shirakawa-go for a few hours while travelling enroute to takayama by nohi bus. the village should be covered in snow in feb, offering a more serene tone.
nara - a day trip from either osaka or kyoto would suffice - served by frequent commuter trains in less than 1 hour.
both nikko and hakone are top day trip destinations from tokyo. the latter is more for natural scenery and some museums spread out in the mountains. apart from those, consider also kamakura/enoshima closer to the sea.
koyasan would likely be covered in snow at 1000m. for an overnight stay in temples, beware to arrive earlier as vegetarian dinner is usually served early. ours was served before 6pm. also note that most rooms do not have own bathroom/toilet and have to be shared. if this is an issue, book one with own toilet as we did. though it costs more, it's good value for money.
>>we want to stay at least one night in a ryokan with an onsen and eat a kaiseki.
along your itin, consider hakone before returning to tokyo. hakone has more than 200+ ryokans spread out in the mountains. i usually recommend those around lake ashi where mt fuji can be viewed on clear days.

--nabana sato bad place visit, ""must"" sort place either. park hour outside central nagoya;
--if basing kyoto, many day trips planned, best pick base within 5-minute walking radius kyoto station;
--if concerns dragging bags moving around, luggage forwarding strategically. bags hotels door-to-door. delivery next day (except airport requires days) need overnight bags between;
--green car good vital. ordinary car seats much comfortable airplane's economy seat.","another suggestion:
2/15 -2/18 tokyo full days, take one day to head to kamakura-enoshima
2/19 nikko day trip
2/20 izu peninsula, kawazu/izu kogen day trip for early blossoms
2/21 early train to kanazawa and overnight there, see snow monkeys en route if interested
2/22 kanazawa
2/23 bus to shirakawago morning, continue to takayama in the afternoon
2/24 takayama until the afternoon, nagoya overnight if you want to visit nabana no sato. otherwise, head to kyoto
2/25-3/3 kyoto, including day trips to 1) nara/osaka; 2) koyasan (unless you think your kids would enjoy a temple stay with morning service); 3) hiroshima/miyajima (go early); 4) himeji (1/2 day required)
3/4 train to odawara for hakone. head to hnd airport later in the evening via shinagawa
3/5 1am depart
key points to this proposed itinerary:
--landing at 6am, your hotel will most likely only allow you to drop your bags off. hnd airport has paid showers if you are interested. you then need to plan your time to pass the morning until after lunch. asakusa (with or without skytree) and tsukiji market are good candidates
--from 2/19 to 3/4, you can use a 14-day jr pass to cover all jr travels. that means you can use shinkansen or limited express trains to cover many of the rides to izu peninsula, nikko, kanazawa, kyoto-osaka-hiroshima, hakone and even heading towards the airport;
--nabana no sato is not a bad place to visit, but it's not really a ""must"" sort of place either. the park itself is about an hour outside central nagoya;
--if basing yourself at kyoto, with so many day trips planned, it's best to pick a base within a 5-minute walking radius of kyoto station;
--if you have concerns dragging bags while moving around, use luggage forwarding strategically. your bags will go between hotels door-to-door. delivery is next day (except to the airport which requires 2 days) so you will need to use overnight bags in between;
--green car is good but it's not vital. ordinary car seats are much more comfortable than an airplane's economy seat.",0,0,0,0,JP,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,50.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,50,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,50,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,50,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,200,50,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,200,50,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,55000,"[""['suggestion',"", ""'2',"", ""'15',"", ""'2',"", ""'18',"", ""'tokyo',"", ""'full',"", ""'days',"", ""'one',"", ""'day',"", ""'head',"", ""'kamakura',"", ""'enoshima',"", ""'2',"", ""'19',"", ""'nikko',"", ""'day',"", ""'trip',"", ""'2',"", ""'20',"", ""'izu',"", ""'peninsula',"", ""'kawazu',"", ""'izu',"", ""'kogen',"", ""'day',"", ""'trip',"", ""'early',"", ""'blossom',"", ""'2',"", ""'21',"", ""'early',"", ""'train',"", ""'kanazawa',"", ""'overnight',"", ""'see',"", ""'snow',"", ""'monkey',"", ""'en',"", ""'route',"", ""'interest',"", ""'2',"", ""'22',"", ""'kanazawa',"", ""'2',"", ""'23',"", ""'bus',"", ""'shirakawago',"", ""'morning',"", ""'continue',"", ""'takayama',"", ""'afternoon',"", ""'2',"", ""'24',"", ""'takayama',"", ""'afternoon',"", ""'nagoya',"", ""'overnight',"", ""'visit',"", ""'nabana',"", ""'sato',"", ""'head',"", ""'kyoto',"", ""'2',"", ""'25',"", ""'3',"", ""'3',"", ""'kyoto',"", ""'include',"", ""'day',"", ""'trip',"", ""'1',"", ""'nara',"", ""'osaka',"", ""'2',"", ""'koyasan',"", ""'kid',"", ""'temple',"", ""'stay',"", ""'morning',"", ""'service',"", ""'3',"", ""'hiroshima',"", ""'miyajima',"", ""'early',"", ""'4',"", ""'himeji',"", ""'1',"", ""'2',"", ""'day',"", ""'require',"", ""'3',"", ""'4',"", ""'train',"", ""'odawara',"", ""'hakone',"", ""'head',"", ""'hnd',"", ""'airport',"", ""'via',"", ""'shinagawa',"", ""'3',"", ""'5',"", ""'1am',"", ""'depart',"", ""'key',"", ""'point',"", ""'propose',"", ""'itinerary',"", ""'land',"", ""'6am',"", ""'hotel',"", ""'allow',"", ""'drop',"", ""'bag',"", ""'hnd',"", ""'airport',"", ""'pay',"", ""'shower',"", ""'interest',"", ""'plan',"", ""'time',"", ""'pass',"", ""'morning',"", ""'lunch',"", ""'asakusa',"", ""'skytree',"", ""'tsukiji',"", ""'market',"", ""'good',"", ""'candidates',"", ""'2',"", ""'19',"", ""'3',"", ""'4',"", ""'14',"", ""'day',"", ""'jr',"", ""'pass',"", ""'cover',"", ""'jr',"", ""'travel',"", ""'shinkansen',"", ""'limit',"", ""'express',"", ""'train',"", ""'cover',"", ""'many',"", ""'rid',"", ""'izu',"", ""'peninsula',"", ""'nikko',"", ""'kanazawa',"", ""'kyoto',"", ""'osaka',"", ""'hiroshima',"", ""'hakone',"", ""'head',"", ""'airport',"", ""'nabana',"", ""'sato',"", ""'bad',"", ""'place',"", ""'visit',"", ""'must',"", ""'sort',"", ""'place',"", ""'park',"", ""'hour',"", ""'outside',"", ""'central',"", ""'nagoya',"", ""'base',"", ""'kyoto',"", ""'many',"", ""'day',"", ""'trip',"", ""'plan',"", ""'pick',"", ""'base',"", ""'5',"", ""'minute',"", ""'walk',"", ""'radius',"", ""'kyoto',"", ""'station',"", ""'concern',"", ""'drag',"", ""'bag',"", ""'move',"", ""'luggage',"", ""'strategically',"", ""'bag',"", ""'hotels',"", ""'door',"", ""'door',"", ""'delivery',"", ""'day',"", ""'except',"", ""'airport',"", ""'require',"", ""'2',"", ""'days',"", ""'overnight',"", ""'bag',"", ""'green',"", ""'car',"", ""'good',"", ""'vital',"", ""'ordinary',"", ""'car',"", ""'seat',"", ""'much',"", ""'comfortable',"", ""'airplanes',"", ""'economy',"", ""'seat']""]",True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

as suggested i am dividing the two itineraries in two threads, hope this helps.
also, i already changed some of the stuff you recommended (
i am currently planning my future (hopefully 2022) trip to vietnam, and i was extremely impressed by the beauty of the rural areas.
i am a photographer, so mind that any trip i do is aimed towards that, just as much as having an authentic experience.
i laid out two itineraries, one in april and one in september, as they seem like great months overall for the whole country, weather wise.
my april itinerary looks like this:
31st march, arrival in ho chi minh city, spend two nights there.
2nd april, flight to hue for the hue festival, stay two nights.
4th april, train/whatever from hue to ninh binh, stay three nights.
8th april, mai chau by motorbike from ninh bing, one night.
9th april, pu luong by motorbike, day trip or one night.

but since i've been revisiting (virtually) the đắk lắk area the last couple of weeks, i'll just say that there have been a lot of changes. many more homestays (besides the new/newer hotels) that look quite nice and comfortable as opposed to the dingy guesthouses of old.
if anybody plans to visit, march would be a good time if you like dry weather.
it's the season for the coffee flower blooms and also the season for the rubber plants to shed their leaves:

the bi-annual coffee festival is held in buôn ma thuột in march on odd years, but as it was suspended this year, there's a good possibility for it next year.
on the other hand, if you like waterfalls, opt for november - which is also toward the end of the rainy season; time for the tree marigold to blossom.

after buôn ma thuột/đắk lắk, if you time it well, you could join the 3 to 4-day festival up in chư pah (gia lai) - just north of pleiku.

march is good if you like the occasional fog that brings out the mistyque of the place.
the view from the mua cave also depends. people start planting some time in march so you may see fields of water entertwined with fields of greens.
if you're on the river, you may see the peasants working.
there might be another incentive to travel in week 2 or 3 of april, when you may catch a local or regional festival.
the one in hoa lư should be staged between the 6th and 10th.

weather wise, as in rain / wet / potential flooding, you probably want to avoid september through to end of november.

one question i have is how is the weather in may? also, what process is the hoang su phi district in regarding the growing of rice? i know the falling water season occurs differently in northern vietnam, but would like to land myself there during this time. is early may too early? or should i move my visit to the backend of my trip? if i am in northern vietnam during the earlier part of the month, what would be a good suggestion for an area where the falling water season occurs if hoang su phi is not the best option? all information is greatly appreciated.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g1544599-i21344-k13460878-Hoang_Su_Phi_in_May-Ha_Giang_Ha_Giang_Province.html,Hoang Su Phi in May,TheFiveCentDime,US,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheFiveCentDime?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,100.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,100,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,100,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,100,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,40000,"[""['hello',"", ""'travel',"", ""'much',"", ""'possibility',"", ""'stand',"", ""'right',"", ""'coronavirus',"", ""'plan',"", ""'3',"", ""'week',"", ""'trip',"", ""'vietnam',"", ""'future',"", ""'may',"", ""'intent',"", ""'traverse',"", ""'country',"", ""'north',"", ""'south',"", ""'majority',"", ""'north',"", ""'spend',"", ""'time',"", ""'foothills',"", ""'mountains',"", ""'trek',"", ""'remove',"", ""'commercialize',"", ""'hence',"", ""'sapa',"", ""'draw',"", ""'many',"", ""'reason',"", ""'lot',"", ""'interest',"", ""'ha',"", ""'giang',"", ""'appeal',"", ""'many',"", ""'ways',"", ""'one',"", ""'question',"", ""'weather',"", ""'may',"", ""'process',"", ""'hoang',"", ""'su',"", ""'phi',"", ""'district',"", ""'grow',"", ""'rice',"", ""'fall',"", ""'water',"", ""'season',"", ""'occur',"", ""'differently',"", ""'northern',"", ""'vietnam',"", ""'land',"", ""'time',"", ""'early',"", ""'may',"", ""'early',"", ""'move',"", ""'visit',"", ""'backend',"", ""'trip',"", ""'northern',"", ""'vietnam',"", ""'earlier',"", ""'part',"", ""'month',"", ""'good',"", ""'suggestion',"", ""'area',"", ""'fall',"", ""'water',"", ""'season',"", ""'occur',"", ""'hoang',"", ""'su',"", ""'phi',"", ""'information',"", ""'greatly']""]",False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

we start rainy season northern vietnam large swath mainland southeast asia. but, start peak july - august. hand, heavy wintertime fog spring haze, skies often clear, good time landscape photography. north vietnam beginning myself, look promising year.
you study weather here:

may early rice planting hoang su phi xim man. difficult exactly start, mid late-june.
here shot thông nguyên, taken july 4, 2019. see immature seedlings are, guess missed planting week.

if interested rice planting, last year started sa pa bat xat districts 10th may. mu cang chi started 20th.
none destinations require deal planning visit. could easily ha noi latest rice-planting intel, check weather, head north.
how traveling north? motorcycle, hire-car, bus?
take care :)","hello,
we can say that may is the start of the rainy season not only in northern vietnam but a large swath of mainland southeast asia. but, it's just the start and really doesn't peak until july - august. on the other hand, you don't have the heavy wintertime fog or spring haze, so the skies are often very clear, a good time for landscape photography. i would like to be in north vietnam by the beginning of may myself, but it doesn't look promising for this year.
you can study up on the weather here:

may is too early for rice planting in hoang su phi and xim man. difficult to say exactly when it will start, but i would say mid to late-june.
here is a shot from thông nguyên, taken on july 4, 2019. you can see how immature the seedlings are, i guess i missed planting by a week.

if you are really interested in rice planting, last year they started in sa pa and bat xat districts around the 10th of may. mu cang chi started around may 20th.
none of these destinations require a great deal of planning to visit. you could easily go up to ha noi and get the latest rice-planting intel, check the weather, and then head further north.
how will you be traveling in the north? motorcycle, hire-car, bus?

@scott
thanks for the info, i am sure it will be stunning either way! and yes, part of the plan was ninh binh and pu luong would be in a different stage all together. glad to know i will be within target for that :)
@michael
i unfortunately do not drive, so motorbike is definitely out of the question. most likely bus, private car, or a combo of the two, would be my route of travel (have been considering hoang su phi lodge, and one of their trekking packages). thanks for the info on weather in general for the area, and that of your experience in july. good to know regarding mu cang chai as well. that has also been in consideration (recommendations in detail there would certainly be helpful). for my time, the ha giang loop was not really factored into my itinerary, even though i know it is one of the major draws to the region. perhaps i will reevaluate that.
@john
maybe the end of may might be better to aim for. i could flip my itinerary around and go south to north in this case. my work schedule limits me to travel within the month, and not straddling two. this year i have already factored not be an option, so looking toward 2022 for this. i was starting to plan my trip to vietnam back in 2019, but jumped on an opportunity to go to the philippines with a friend instead, and had a fantastic time (my first intro to se asia). we basically were in ph when covid went into a full scale pandemic, and had some trouble getting home in mid feb due to lockdowns and travel bans. we were very lucky. congrats on your first dose of the vaccine! and yes, hopefully we can all look forward to when travel can resume.

you have time to do lots of research and ask many questions as you decide what is important to your group; big city, beach, warm weather, etc.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g293921-i8432-k13564400-Milestone_Birthday_10_Day_Trip_to_Vietnam_Thailand-Vietnam.html,Milestone Birthday 10 Day Trip to Vietnam & Thailand,golfandfish,Washington State,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/golfandfish?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,50,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,200,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,50,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,25000,"[""['month',"", ""'plan',"", ""'trip',"", ""'lock',"", ""'birthday',"", ""'month',"", ""'weather',"", ""'influence',"", ""'plan',"", ""'various',"", ""'place',"", ""'season',"", ""'visit',"", ""'one',"", ""'countries',"", ""'visit',"", ""'eliminate',"", ""'travel',"", ""'time',"", ""'airplane',"", ""'pretty',"", ""'much',"", ""'waste',"", ""'day',"", ""'organize',"", ""'trip',"", ""'large',"", ""'group',"", ""'less',"", ""'move',"", ""'time',"", ""'lot',"", ""'research',"", ""'many',"", ""'question',"", ""'important',"", ""'group',"", ""'big',"", ""'city',"", ""'beach',"", ""'warm',"", ""'weather']""]",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

travelfish has a pretty good list of highlights:

> should we fly or go overnight train?
either is good, but it depends on where you're going and what fits your schedule. trains are fine, but don't go everywhere.
the one thing to remember with vietnam is that it's bigger than it looks on the map and that travel is slower and more tiring than you'd expect. maybe that's two things. and it's worth checking out the expected weather:  there's three things..
it all depends on what your interests are and what you'd like to see/do. you've probably got at least a year to plan before you'd be able to travel, so there's plenty of time to research and plan.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g293921-i8432-k13554198-Vietnam_three_weeks-Vietnam.html,Vietnam - three weeks,manatdollar,US,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/manatdollar?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,50,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,50,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,200,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,25000,"[""['wonder',"", ""'travelfish',"", ""'pretty',"", ""'good',"", ""'highlight',"", ""'north',"", ""'vietnam',"", ""'worth',"", ""'time',"", ""'fly',"", ""'overnight',"", ""'train',"", ""'good',"", ""'fit',"", ""'schedule',"", ""'train',"", ""'fine',"", ""'everywhere',"", ""'one',"", ""'vietnam',"", ""'bigger',"", ""'map',"", ""'travel',"", ""'slower',"", ""'tire',"", ""'youd',"", ""'expect',"", ""'two',"", ""'worth',"", ""'expect',"", ""'weather',"", ""'three',"", ""'interest',"", ""'youd',"", ""'see',"", ""'youve',"", ""'least',"", ""'plan',"", ""'youd',"", ""'able',"", ""'travel',"", ""'plenty',"", ""'time',"", ""'research',"", ""'plan']""]",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

far clear vietnam open 2022. 1st half extremely unlikely opinion, unless vaccine fairy finds millions spare doses. second half 2022? far away guess.
vietnam needs 150 million doses caver 75 million people. they're currently less 30,000 people fully vaccinated million vaccinated once. plans orders 110 million doses, they're delivery year. home grown vaccines trials, help safe, effective, approved, available massive quantities. that's lot ifs.
january/february pretty nice phu quoc want chill. plenty accommodation eateries. weather's seeing lot country: 
do watch tết 1st february. expect massive logistical problems trying travel days side.
you can't currently visa vietnam all, so, plan investigate like, booking anything sure travel vietnam possible (which doubt much feb 2022 :-( )

far from clear that vietnam will be open by 2022. 1st half is extremely unlikely in my opinion, unless the vaccine fairy finds millions of spare doses. second half of 2022? too far away to guess.
vietnam needs 150 million doses to caver 75 million people. they're currently at less than 30,000 people fully vaccinated and about one million vaccinated once. they have plans and orders for about 110 million doses, but they're not all for delivery this year. they have home grown vaccines in trials, which might help if they are safe, effective, approved, and available in massive quantities. that's a lot of ifs.
january/february are pretty nice on phu quoc if all you want to do is chill. plenty of accommodation and eateries. but the weather's ok for seeing a lot more of the country: 
do watch out for tết which is 1st february. expect massive logistical problems if trying to travel a few days either side.
you can't currently get a visa for vietnam at all, so, plan and investigate all you like, but i wouldn't be booking anything until it's sure that travel to vietnam is possible (which i doubt very much it will be by feb 2022 :-( )

(tageckozy)","the biggest prpobem we should care for travelings vietnam after new corona ends is not about the condition of each destination(sightseeing spots, beaches, nightlife spots etc), weather and the time to visit there etc but about people's mind in vietnam after new corona problem ends though it's still uncertain when the time to go to vietnam in safe comes.
i think that the quality=mind of people in vietnam after new corona will surely return to 1990's when vietnam government officially opened their country to foreigners(=opened ""free traveling"" without getting parmission after entering into vietnam).
it's the storm of rips-off, scammings, agressive overchargings etc that vilently blew to foreign visitors in 1990's (it has also blown in vietnam till today).
people's mind for rips-off, scammings, agressive overchargings to foreign visitors in vietnam is ""immortal""(they are very thitsty now for getting their targets and victims due to the decreasing of the number of foreign visitors) so unless you do aboiding those bad acts concerning money conciously, safe and enjoyable travel is never guaranteed even if you aim to do anything you like and the beautiful scenery and food etc are the same to the past, or if the travel circumstances and means are restored.
this is my opinion based on my plenty of bad and bitter experiences in 1990's after vietnam government officially opened their country to foreigners though i also have plenty of good experiences

i'm sorry.. clearer original post. intent options tokyo kyoto:
1. flying haneda sapporo 12/28 flying sapporo kansai 12/30 minimize long crowded train trips. flying better?
2. taking train mie prefecture see nabana sato park illuminations.
3. taking train nagano, shirakawago snow. trains crowded going nagano kyoto coming tokyo?
4. going hiroshima/miyajima. unique fly hiroshima haneda fly kansai.
i trying change flight going tokyo looking good! definitely change hotels disney portion closer tokyo station shinjuku. read going disney christmas crowded research that.
thank suggestions!","thank you everyone for your input.
i'm sorry.. i should have been clearer in my original post. my intent is to do only 1 out of the 4 options between tokyo and kyoto:
1. flying from haneda to sapporo on 12/28 then flying from sapporo to kansai on 12/30 to minimize long crowded train trips. is flying really any better?
2. taking the train to mie prefecture to see nabana no sato park illuminations.
3. taking the train to nagano, shirakawago for snow. are the trains just as crowded going from nagano to kyoto as they would be coming from tokyo?
4. going to hiroshima/miyajima. not really unique but we can fly to hiroshima from haneda then fly into kansai.
i am trying to change the flight to one going to tokyo but it's not looking good! i would definitely change hotels after the disney portion to closer to tokyo station or shinjuku. i read that going to disney after christmas is very crowded but i will do more research on that.

","#7,
your option 1 is a waste of time and money unless you have mandatory plans such as skiing + onsen in hokkaido. sapporo alone is not worthy for such a detour from your main itin in honshu. snow would be around in shirakawa-go and kanazawa by end dec.
opt 2+3. doable. tokyo > nagoya > shirakawago > kyoto via kanazawa or the other way as mentioned by sammy in #3.

if the jr station is a little bit farther, just walk for 5-10 mins more although summer heat might be uncomfortable.
if you are not planning to get a jr pass, it is 600-1500 jpy, depending on how much you need to take subways. the cheapest ride is around 180-200 jpy, even just one station apart.
sometimes, they can offer a cheaper one day subway pass on weekends but that depends. i only experienced it in osaka though.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g294232-i525-k13456636-Japan_2021-Japan.html,Japan 2021 ?,CarterStrife7,"Otaru, Japan",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CarterStrife7?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,200,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,50,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,22500,"[""['jr',"", ""'pass',"", ""'travel',"", ""'japan',"", ""'tokyo',"", ""'jr',"", ""'local',"", ""'trans',"", ""'tokyo',"", ""'subway',"", ""'rid',"", ""'place',"", ""'reachable',"", ""'via',"", ""'jr',"", ""'line',"", ""'jr',"", ""'station',"", ""'little',"", ""'farther',"", ""'walk',"", ""'5',"", ""'10',"", ""'mins',"", ""'summer',"", ""'heat',"", ""'uncomfortable',"", ""'plan',"", ""'jr',"", ""'pass',"", ""'600',"", ""'1500',"", ""'jpy',"", ""'much',"", ""'subways',"", ""'cheapest',"", ""'ride',"", ""'180',"", ""'200',"", ""'jpy',"", ""'one',"", ""'station',"", ""'apart',"", ""'cheaper',"", ""'one',"", ""'day',"", ""'subway',"", ""'pass',"", ""'weekend',"", ""'experience',"", ""'osaka']""]",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

we are considering re-booking our trip for 9 days at the end of december 2021
(christmas and new years) or 8-9 days in late february 2022. is there much of a difference between those 2 months for a standard first visit to japan (say 4 nights tokyo, 4 nights kyoto)? late december seems to be slightly less cloudy and has beautiful light displays and fireworks, but is more expensive and crowded to visit. february gives us 2 more months for the covid situation to improve, and seems less expensive, but i hope that it is not too rainy and cloudy in kyoto and tokyo in late february. we are not bothered by cold at all for a city trip like this, but constant rain and dreary weather would be a big disappointment.
if anyone has thoughts as between trying for late december 2021 versus late february 2022, i would greatly appreciate hearing from you. it has been our dream to visit japan for a long time, and although obviously we cannot visit between now and the olympics, i really hope that by late december it will be a much better situation. thank you so much in advance!",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g294232-i525-k13538118-Visit_Japan_December_2020_or_February_2021-Japan.html,Visit Japan December 2020 or February 2021 ?,NYTravelerBD,"Larchmont, New York",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NYTravelerBD?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,134,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,300,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,134,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,47956,"[""['wife',"", ""'visit',"", ""'japan',"", ""'8',"", ""'old',"", ""'daughter',"", ""'2020',"", ""'cancel',"", ""'due',"", ""'covid',"", ""'course',"", ""'right',"", ""'least',"", ""'olympics',"", ""'american',"", ""'visitors',"", ""'allow',"", ""'hop',"", ""'fall',"", ""'begin',"", ""'wife',"", ""'vaccinate',"", ""'daughter',"", ""'old',"", ""'vaccinate',"", ""'book',"", ""'trip',"", ""'9',"", ""'days',"", ""'end',"", ""'december',"", ""'christmas',"", ""'new',"", ""'8',"", ""'9',"", ""'days',"", ""'late',"", ""'february',"", ""'2022',"", ""'much',"", ""'difference',"", ""'2',"", ""'months',"", ""'standard',"", ""'visit',"", ""'japan',"", ""'4',"", ""'nights',"", ""'tokyo',"", ""'4',"", ""'nights',"", ""'kyoto',"", ""'late',"", ""'december',"", ""'slightly',"", ""'less',"", ""'cloudy',"", ""'beautiful',"", ""'light',"", ""'display',"", ""'fireworks',"", ""'expensive',"", ""'crowd',"", ""'visit',"", ""'february',"", ""'2',"", ""'months',"", ""'covid',"", ""'situation',"", ""'improve',"", ""'less',"", ""'expensive',"", ""'rainy',"", ""'cloudy',"", ""'kyoto',"", ""'tokyo',"", ""'late',"", ""'february',"", ""'bother',"", ""'cold',"", ""'city',"", ""'trip',"", ""'constant',"", ""'rain',"", ""'dreary',"", ""'weather',"", ""'big',"", ""'disappointment',"", ""'thoughts',"", ""'try',"", ""'late',"", ""'december',"", ""'versus',"", ""'late',"", ""'february',"", ""'2022',"", ""'greatly',"", ""'hear',"", ""'dream',"", ""'visit',"", ""'japan',"", ""'long',"", ""'time',"", ""'obviously',"", ""'cannot',"", ""'visit',"", ""'olympics',"", ""'late',"", ""'december',"", ""'much',"", ""'situation',"", ""'much',"", ""'advance']""]",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

i'd say dress in layers (one day in tokyo it was 7°c in the morning and 17°c in the afternoon) and take time to rest and have a hot (or cold) drink.
and if you can, take the shinkansen between tokyo and kyoto and choose seat e (d is fine too) in any of the carriages to get a view of mount fuji from the train; in winter, the sky is more likely to be clear so the chances of seeing mount fuji are greater!
note: look into takuhaibin, the luggage delivery service.

i used them between tokyo and kyoto, making for a hassle-free travel experience on the train (it takes 2 days, if i remember well, for the luggage to arrive so plan accordingly).

a june trip (not before 2022!) would be ideal for the personal calendar, but i understand that is japan's rainy season. this trip would include the standard tourist spots on honshu - tokyo, kyoto, hakone, perhaps kanazawa and takayama. 2 - 3 weeks.
i have lived in singapore and also spent a lot of time in hong kong in all months including typhoon season and august humidity. i've also visited cambodia during rainy season.
perhaps someone can compare japan's june rainy season to one of those locations? i'm wondering if rain comes late in the day for several hours? any time of day, but probably not the entire day? entire day for several days on end? i recognize that no one season is predictable based on the past and there are yearly variations, but any notion of what to expect would be helpful.

rain in hk - sw monsoon rain from end april till may/june. sometimes, presence of stationary fronts might lead to downpours for days until it either dissipates or moves north if the sw monsoon gains the upper hand.
rainy season in japan except hokkaido - roughly from mid june to mid july. it can be in drizzles or heavy downpours depending on the scale and duration of that frontal rain band.
for nice ""shoulder"" seasons, consider may (after the golden week) when weather is generally warm but not too hot nor humid. another timeslot for sightseeing is oct to early nov if you prefer to avoid the koyo (fall foliage) season in those places. weather is drier and day temps are in low 20s or high teens, though occasional typhoons may pass by or land resulting in a few rainy days in affected locations.
ps. have visited singapore all year round - probably over 70 times for business stretching for 15+ years, 10+ in tokyo from jan thru' oct for business and another 80+ for personal travels all over japan (except okinawa).

edited: 2:32 am, april 06,","as per yearly average, sakura usually reaches full bloom in tokyo around end mar/early april.
when do the cherry blossoms bloom?

however, timing has been more fickle in recent years due to global warming. for instance, full bloom dates in tokyo have been about 7 days earlier than average this year.

for planning, my suggestion is to plan for the last week of march if your timeline is flexible. note that this is just my guess - based on my 10+ sakura visits in japan. jma usually releases its sakura forecast from around late feb, and of course the closer the more accurate, and barring any unforeseen weather conditions closer and/or during the blooming season.
in general, weather during sakura blossom would not be that cold. expect day temps to range from low to high teens (in degree celcius). in march 2021, there were a few days when day temps shot up to low 20s.

rainy days cannot be avoided in japan, which is surrounded by oceans in all directions. nevertheless, rain in that timeline is more due to passing frontal rain, resulting in mostly drizzles for roughly 2 to 3 days max per location. umbrellas can be borrowed from hotel concierge or can be bought in convenience stores around the corners.

we go to bali mostly for diving (me and daughter), snorkeling (all of us including mrs pig) and chillaxing (all of us). so our itinerary revolves around these interests/activities.

we are hoping for nov 2021. as oz will be out we will do something like amed - gilis - nusa lembongan - sanur or
amed - gilis - kuta lombok (southern lombok - laid back place, big beaches with picturesque coastline) - fly back to bali (30mins) - sanur

as you haven't yet told us what you actually want from your bali holiday, it's very hard to offer more advice than that already given.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g294226-i7220-k13467742-Kuta_Bali_is_it_a_nice_place_to_stay-Bali.html,"Kuta, Bali - is it a nice place to stay?",cbimages,AU,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cbimages?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,100,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,100,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,100,100,0,0,0.0,0.0,100,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,100,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,60000,"[""['becky',"", ""'date',"", ""'right',"", ""'australian',"", ""'school',"", ""'holiday',"", ""'expect',"", ""'place',"", ""'crowd',"", ""'expensive',"", ""'hotel',"", ""'pool',"", ""'may',"", ""'full',"", ""'children',"", ""'traffic',"", ""'hellishly',"", ""'heavy',"", ""'worse',"", ""'kuta',"", ""'legian',"", ""'seminyak',"", ""'strip',"", ""'reason',"", ""'youve',"", ""'seminyak',"", ""'kuta',"", ""'previous',"", ""'post',"", ""'theyre',"", ""'part',"", ""'urban',"", ""'sprawl',"", ""'walk',"", ""'one',"", ""'beach',"", ""'report',"", ""'surf',"", ""'rougher',"", ""'rip',"", ""'seminyak',"", ""'tell',"", ""'bali',"", ""'holiday',"", ""'hard',"", ""'advice']""]",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
774,4261,ID,"can’t missing out. different different likes/dislikes happy. we’re big ubud fans. days stay. bother. that’s us.
you can’t fit everything want see trip.
we tend start amed every year every year slightly different itinerary (usually mrs pig daughter) hasn’t (i solo diving/chillaxing trips places mrs pig daughter haven’t).
diving snorkeling forms large part holidays whether mrs pig (who doesn’t dive loves snorkeling) daughter (who marine biologist loves diving snorkeling).
so holiday sure mrs pig isn’t bored/becomes dive widow whilst diving.
that’s amed good. ican dives morning finish day lunch.
give mrs pig doorstep snorkeling, chilled places eat shopping happy.
we big amed fans generally spend days amed.
myself daughter easy going diving. easy access “fall water” snorkeling easy going life. mrs pig likes fact fall water snorkel i’m diving. enough places eat drink variety.
i haven’t found dive centre gilis matches dive amed accept “difference”. flexible “friendly”.
but mrs p fall water snorkeling lot shopping amed
after nights amed much night people places gilis/nl night “down south” flying home.
pemuteran good. nice place stay. good places eat drink main road. stay 
however wouldn’t pemuteran gilis/lombok trip.
we tend start amed amed - pemuteran - ubud - “down south” works well.
ubud - pemuteran - amed - “down south” works.
if lots time obviously amed could gilis “down south”
we transfers sightseeing. e.g. ubud pemuteran stop lake beratan ulun danu beratan and/or northern waterfalls.
between ubud amed easily stop tirta gangga water palace.
we often stop going amed “down south” literally drive past front door.
it much choice.
but nice blend everything taste feel ….. rest want come something else.","can’t say if you are missing out. we are all different and have different likes/dislikes and things that make us happy. we’re not big ubud fans. might have a few days stay. may not bother. but that’s us.
you can’t fit in everything you might want to see and do in one trip.
we tend to start in amed every year but every year we have a slightly different itinerary that one of us (usually mrs pig and daughter) hasn’t been to (i have had solo diving/chillaxing trips where i have been to places mrs pig and daughter haven’t).
diving and snorkeling forms a large part of our holidays whether me and mrs pig (who doesn’t dive but loves snorkeling) or with our daughter (who is a marine biologist and loves diving and snorkeling).
so when we go on holiday i make sure mrs pig isn’t bored/becomes a dive widow whilst i am diving.
that’s why amed is so good. ican do 2 dives in the morning and finish for the day at lunch.
give mrs pig doorstep snorkeling, chilled places to eat and some shopping and she is happy.
we are big amed fans so generally spend the most days in amed.
myself and daughter like the easy going diving. we all like the easy access “fall in the water” snorkeling and the easy going life. mrs pig likes the fact she can just fall in the water snorkel while i’m diving. enough places to eat and drink to have variety.
i haven’t yet found a dive centre in gilis that matches how we dive in amed so accept the “difference”. not as flexible or “friendly”.
but for mrs p fall in the water snorkeling and lot more shopping than amed
after 5 nights or more in amed we are then very much 3 or 4 night people in other places like gilis/nl etc and now only have a night or 2 “down south” before flying home.
pemuteran also good. nice place to stay. few good places to eat and drink on the main road. we stay at 
however we wouldn’t have pemuteran and say gilis/lombok on the same trip.
we tend to always start in amed so amed - pemuteran - ubud - “down south” works well.
ubud - pemuteran - amed - “down south” also works.
if you have lots of time obviously after amed could do gilis then “down south”
we also make use of transfers to do a bit of sightseeing. e.g. between ubud and pemuteran can stop at lake beratan ulun danu beratan and/or northern waterfalls.
between ubud and amed can easily stop at tirta gangga water palace.
we often stop there if going from amed to “down south” as you literally drive past the front door.
it is all probably too much choice.
but i think you have a nice blend of everything to give you a taste and feel ….. and like the rest of us make you want to come back again to do something else.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g294226-i7220-k13599665-2022_back_to_the_drawing_board-Bali.html,2022 -

i’ve heard nasty eye infections leading blindness normal bodies water pools world, given i’ve heard excessive water pollution there, well tap water quality, i’m little concerned!
would love hear other’s experiences what’s worked them!","i’m planning my first trip to bali, and am looking to see what other contact lens wearers’ experiences are in regards to safety.
i’ve heard the ocean water is quite polluted, but my sight is really bad, and i can’t afford lasik, so if i want to surf or enter the water and not get lost, i pretty much have to wear contacts. (i don’t want prescription goggles)
my plan is to wear daily contacts and throw them out immediately after swimming, and on days i don’t swim, throw them out at the end of the day.
i’ve heard about nasty eye infections leading to even blindness from normal bodies of water and even pools all around the world, so given what i’ve heard about the excessive water pollution there, as well as the tap water quality, i’m a little bit concerned!
would love to hear other’s experiences and what’s worked for them!",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g294226-i7220-k13583532-Tips_for_Contact_Lens_Use_in_Bali-Bali.html,Tips for Contact Lens Use in Bali?,Hailey,"Waterloo, Canada",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/haileydoerr?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,100,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,100,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,100,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,100,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,100,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,50000,"[""['i’m',"", ""'plan',"", ""'trip',"", ""'bali',"", ""'see',"", ""'contact',"", ""'lens',"", ""'wearers’',"", ""'experience',"", ""'safety',"", ""'i’ve',"", ""'hear',"", ""'ocean',"", ""'water',"", ""'quite',"", ""'pollute',"", ""'sight',"", ""'bad',"", ""'can’t',"", ""'afford',"", ""'lasik',"", ""'surf',"", ""'enter',"", ""'water',"", ""'lose',"", ""'pretty',"", ""'much',"", ""'wear',"", ""'contact',"", ""'don’t',"", ""'prescription',"", ""'goggle',"", ""'plan',"", ""'wear',"", ""'daily',"", ""'contact',"", ""'throw',"", ""'immediately',"", ""'swim',"", ""'days',"", ""'don’t',"", ""'swim',"", ""'throw',"", ""'end',"", ""'day',"", ""'i’ve',"", ""'hear',"", ""'nasty',"", ""'eye',"", ""'infections',"", ""'lead',"", ""'blindness',"", ""'normal',"", ""'body',"", ""'water',"", ""'pool',"", ""'world',"", ""'i’ve',"", ""'hear',"", ""'excessive',"", ""'water',"", ""'pollution',"", ""'tap',"", ""'water',"", ""'quality',"", ""'i’m',"", ""'little',"", ""'concern',"", ""'hear',"", ""'other’s',"", ""'experience',"", ""'what’s',"", ""'work']""]",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

edited: 8:25 pm, 21,","hi grace, just be aware that february/march is the wet season in bali. the west coast beaches will be covered in rubbish and debris. it will be extremely hot and humid. there will be downpours, then maybe sunny, maybe cloudy and sunsets hit and miss. don’t book any activities until your on the ground in bali to ascertain the weather conditions.
currently if and when bali should open it’s stated that there will be green zones - nusa dua, sanur and ubud. there is a 5 day quarantine in designated green zone hotels, a pcr test on arrival and at the end of your quarantine stay. these costs are at your own expense. understand the covid rules for your transit country.
we always book everything ourselves (airline/accommodation). we use an ota and choose the “free cancellation” option when booking accommodation. understand the policy of your airline’s refunds if the flight should be cancelled.
you may like to follow jackie pomeroy’s covid-19 update on fb. as mentioned bali is in indonesia and it’s the indonesian government that makes the final decisions not the bali governor. due to no international travellers to bali in over a year many hotels, restaurants, cafes, shops, supermarkets, shopping centres have closed and it's very likely some will never return so it’s very difficult to recommend anything. many hotels are up for sale.

if booked everything separately different rules rights regarding cancelation/refunds/rebookings.
as example last year numerous flights booked singapore airlines bali 2021. booked third party (expedia) direct. london-bali flights booked turkish airlines (for daughter bf) expedia.
in cases airlines canceled flights (as indonesia closed international tourism importantly dps closed) got full refunds flights. law uk eu. flight canceled entitled full refund.
not long haul. daughter due fly lufthansa muc (home) christmas. uk announced kent variant germany closed border uk canceled flights within 8hrs announcement. daughter missed deadline 10hours (all bags packed xmas presents, extra luggage checked in). seen since.
did money flights, business upgrade, extra baggage.
if decide cancel based governmental advice feel area grey. many airlines offering rebooking vouchers refunds.
this highlighted last year uk british airways refused refunds despite ukgov advice travel. attitude “our flights going - problem chose fly”.
fell foul that. munich daughter london number flights booked ba last year cancel. got ba runaround. idea amount vouchers/credits remaining.
all aside mentioned february/march rainy season beaches seminyak covered rubbish.
balis rainy season isn’t rainy. nothing see rainy season vietnam, thailand cambodia. fact peak amount rain balis rainy season similar peak rain ko samui's dry season.
if want reliable weather consider september. october early november fairly dry.
covid/tourism aside plus point haven’t booked package hotels paid change itinerary. research bali decide change itinerary properties.
you haven’t listed hotels/properties booked. important check exact location property booked. believe hotel tourist brochure location.
this true ubud properties. ubud doesn’t ubud.
there ubud town, ubud district (up 8km town directions) “nowhere near ubud we’ll call ubud 20km 1hrs drive town good day”.
do granted services “free shuttle” town benefit means decent service.
seminyak bad certainly spreads long way. kuta merges legian seminyak crossing road bar/shop located along long, mainly surfing kuta beach.
you “seminyak” closer beachwalk mall kuta seminyak square.
the problem “seminyak” properties spread long way land past bypass towards canggu “countryside” kerobokan.
if wantany info properties simply ask.","hi grace,
if you have booked everything separately there are different rules and rights you have regarding cancelation/refunds/rebookings.
as an example last year we had numerous flights booked with singapore airlines to bali in 2021. some were booked through a third party (expedia) some direct. i also had some london-bali flights booked with turkish airlines (for my daughter and her bf) over expedia.
in all cases the airlines canceled the flights (as indonesia was closed to international tourism and importantly dps was closed) and i got full refunds for all flights. this is the law in the uk and eu. if your flight is canceled you are entitled to a full refund.
not just long haul. my daughter was due to fly with lufthansa to muc (home) for christmas. after uk announced the kent variant germany closed off the border with uk and canceled all flights within 8hrs of the announcement. my daughter missed the deadline by 10hours (all bags packed with xmas presents, extra luggage checked in). not seen her since.
did get all the money back for flights, business upgrade, extra baggage.
if you decide to cancel based on governmental advice or just how you feel then the area is very grey. many airlines were offering rebooking or vouchers but not refunds.
this was highlighted last year in the uk when british airways refused refunds despite ukgov advice not to travel. their attitude was “our flights are still going - not our problem you chose not to fly”.
fell foul of that. us in munich and daughter in london had a number of flights booked with ba last year we had to cancel. got the ba runaround. no idea what amount of vouchers/credits we have remaining.
all that aside as mentioned february/march is rainy season and beaches around seminyak can be covered in rubbish.
balis rainy season isn’t actually that rainy. nothing like what you see in the rainy season in vietnam, thailand and cambodia. in fact the peak amount of rain in balis rainy season is similar to the peak rain in ko samui's dry season.
if you want more reliable weather consider may to september. even october to early november is fairly dry.
covid/tourism aside one plus point if you haven’t booked a package and your hotels are not paid for you can change your itinerary. as you do more research on bali you may decide to change your itinerary or your properties.
you haven’t listed the hotels/properties you booked. it is important that you check the exact location of any property you have booked. do not believe any hotel or tourist brochure on location.
this is especially true for ubud properties. ubud doesn’t mean ubud.
there is ubud town, ubud district (up to 8km from town in some directions) and “nowhere near ubud but we’ll call ourselves ubud anyway even though it is 20km and 1hrs drive to town on a good day”.
do not take for granted services like “free shuttle” to town as a benefit or means there is a decent service.
seminyak is not as bad but certainly spreads out a long way. kuta merges into legian into seminyak just by crossing the road from one bar/shop to another all located along the long, mainly surfing kuta beach.
you can actually be in “seminyak” and be closer to beachwalk mall in kuta than seminyak square.
the problem with “seminyak” properties is that they spread a long way in land past the bypass and also up towards canggu and into the “countryside” of kerobokan.

any advice will be helpful, thank you in advance!",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g294231-i9609-k13487271-Sumatra_Mentawai_islands_trip-Sumatra.html,Sumatra (Mentawai islands) trip,Srdan,"Cacak, Serbia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cpku?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,300,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,30000,"[""['hello',"", ""'everybody',"", ""'visit',"", ""'sumatra',"", ""'may',"", ""'june',"", ""'beginner',"", ""'surfer',"", ""'besides',"", ""'surf',"", ""'lessons',"", ""'islands',"", ""'mentawai',"", ""'islands',"", ""'example',"", ""'snorkel',"", ""'dive',"", ""'mentawais',"", ""'besides',"", ""'surf',"", ""'worth',"", ""'visit',"", ""'end',"", ""'surfer',"", ""'failure',"", ""'besides',"", ""'mentawais',"", ""'visit',"", ""'palau',"", ""'weh',"", ""'overkill',"", ""'visit',"", ""'besides',"", ""'mentawai',"", ""'place',"", ""'worth',"", ""'visit',"", ""'area',"", ""'plan',"", ""'12',"", ""'14',"", ""'days',"", ""'part',"", ""'sumatra',"", ""'sumatra',"", ""'plan',"", ""'bali',"", ""'10',"", ""'days',"", ""'advice',"", ""'helpful',"", ""'advance']""]",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

my own priority is wildlife, so i've researched that, and while yes, bukit lawang is an option to see semi-wild orangutan, the longer path and wilder beasts can be found at ketambe which takes a day to get to instead of a few hours like bukit lawang. bukit lawang isn't big and definitely not as touristy as bali, it is touristy as compared to ketambe. the other even wilder option is to go visit mr. jali's lone place at kedah, which is a few hours further up from kedah along the same road. i've been trying to arrange that and haven't been able to reach jali's operation yet. but it does appear to be operating, as i can see from his instagram (which i found but he doesn't respond to messages in english and i don't speak the local language (yet)).
all of the above is based on extensive research, but not having actually set foot there yet. perhaps some locals will see this thread and give better answers.

i'm currently stuck in singapore. i found that in the last week or so, i was not able to send or receive sms intermittently. on one day, i may be able to send and receive sms in the morning between 7 - 8 am, and then i can't after that. i use the number for otp and the otp would arrive in my phone after a few hours, which render the otp invalid. on other days, i wouldn't be able to send sms in the morning or the the otp won't come. but after 5 pm in the afternoon, all the otp attempts would come flooding in.
i checked with singtel and they say their network is ok. and telkomsel couldn't tell me anything. the case is still pending their resolution.

i am hoping for november but it is just a hope - that is for both the jab and bali opening.
went for the first time in early november in 2018 (amed, gilis, kuta) and weather was great, sea calm and clear).
unlike you, and my parents/sister/brother who are a few miles from you in hessenford/widegates we (me 57 mrs pig - not 57 ) don’t expect our first jab until november.
as oz is jabbing and everybody may be done by october along with i think qantas mooting that international travel for ozzies may be possible from november that may be a possible date given that bali has so many australian tourists.
just a guess/hope/finger in the air/tea leaves/runes. no idea if gregg has polished his crystal balls so not definitive.

they sightseeing laying beach. dad loves diving mom doesn't, dive couple times only.
i idea splitting time two different parts island (i realize long takes cross island).
please let suggestions recommendations!","thank you all very much for the replies! all so helpful! here's a bit more information:
i'm thinking 10 or 12 days in may of 2022 for the trip, hoping that covid will not be an issue at that point (my parents are both vaccinated) and based on my research may is the beginning of the dry season but not high season yet.
they have never been to asia which why i thought of bali as a great introduction to the continent, given that it should be great for both cultural sightseeing and beach life. also, they live in italy and not all destinations have good flight arrangements (i was thinking of thailand and the philippines too but flights are just not convenient).
i'm thinking of a staffed villa for a couple of reasons: first, they love having space and being away from people. they normally prefer quiet and secluded places. second, i think it's an experience to have an amazing villa by the beach (i've done this in thailand before and had an amazing time) where the staff thinks of everything. and while they will definitely go out for a few meals, given that this is a gift i want it to be all inclusive and completely worry-free.
they both like sightseeing and laying on the beach. my dad loves diving but my mom doesn't, so he will probably dive a couple of times only.
i like the idea of splitting their time between two different parts of the island (i didn't realize how long it takes to cross the island).

jaap","hello
i was thinking of planning a trip to indonesia for 3 weeks from late august to the middle of september.
i know the question regarding possible travel concidering covid is a hard one for anyone to answer so i'm not asking that one.
my idea was to book a flight with a cancellation ensurance as there are cheap flights at the moment. and wait untill the situation is more clear. then i will either cancel or plan the rest of my trip.
so my actual question is: is it easy to book accomodation and tours only a week or 2 before or even on the spot?
pottential plans i have (the plans will form with the answer i hope to gain here):
- land in jakarta and go to bali with train/driver with some stops (i would like to try this in about 5 days) (additional question: are trains easy to use in indonesia?)
- few days in bali
- lombok (hike to the top of the vulcano and diving) this is the one i really want to do
- back to bali to take a flight to some other island for hiking and diving ( maybe komodo)
thank you for all your answers

jaap","hello annemieke
thank you very much for your answer. it answers pretty much all of my questions. everything is indeed unsure and if it is still mandatory to go in quarantine i would probally postpone my vacation.
esspecially thanks for the tip about the direct flight from lombok, i tried to search for that but thought it wasn't possible.
which vulcano hike would you recommend? we're not afraid of an adventureous hike. i was a bit afraid of the rinjani climb because i read alot about trash on the mountain and that would bother me alot, it just pains me to see something like that.

i dive, daughter dives wife likes snorkel.
in normal times spend time gili t. usually straight amed (also popular diving,snorkeling, chillaxing).
generally debris gets washed rainy season (dec-feb). dry season frequent july high winds coming java sea leading rough seas resulting debris washed up.
the gili patches beach small underdeveloped beachfront areas (yes some) covered debris. mentioned previously lot beach clear goes walk island parts left “natural”.
the beach areas island largely kept clean. unusual broken bits coral washed beach. tou notice straight away jump fastboat bare feet shallows.
easy find turtles. anywhere pier near www.manta-dive.com (where stay) danima resort fall snorkel turtles. see whilst stood beach.
north end island good snorkel spot.
fastboats
lots fastboat services gilis. companies include free mainland pickups/dropoff services, often direct hotel, ubud major southern resorts.
book tickets bali best prices.
should note overall travel time (ubud pickup, road transfer padangbai, wait around, boat journey) ubud gili ~ 3.5hrs.
this isn’t bad way reach gili 10:30/10:45
problem return. fastboats roundtrip services gili round gilis, compulsory stop lombok, returning bali.
this means return boat service gili mainland 2:45 road transfers couple hours depending going.
return services start boat arrives 11am-12 noon. overall assume least hours return journey time best.
alternative - amed
if want fall water snorkeling look amed.
only 2hrs drive ubud. ubud - amed - gilis.
amed large area. beaches aren’t white sand “caribbean idyll”. sand/stone mix.
it large area. stay jemeluk bay. largest area places eat/drink/stay.
as flavour stay www.kembalibeachbungalows.nl
just walk out, fall water snorkel. often see turtles. lots fish. seen morays, stonefish (dangerous) odd baracuda. nemos etc. seen juvenile blacktip sharks front 
area paid back.
above main jemeluk beach 
good place bite eat views. best views yoga deck whole bali.","we go to bali for diving/snorkeling/chillaxing.
i dive, daughter dives and wife likes to snorkel.
in normal times we spend time on gili t. usually straight after amed (also popular for diving,snorkeling, chillaxing).
generally most debris gets washed up during the rainy season (dec-feb). in the dry season not so frequent however around july can get high winds coming down the java sea leading to rough seas and resulting in debris being washed up.
the thing about gili t is there a patches of beach in the small underdeveloped beachfront areas (yes there are some) which do get covered in debris. as mentioned previously a lot of beach clear up goes on but if you walk around the island there are parts that are left more “natural”.
the beach areas all around the island are largely kept clean. not unusual however for broken bits of coral to get washed up on the beach. tou notice this straight away when you jump of the fastboat in bare feet in the shallows.
easy to find turtles. anywhere between the pier near www.manta-dive.com (where we stay) and danima resort just fall in and snorkel with turtles. can see them whilst stood on the beach.
north end of the island is a good snorkel spot.
fastboats
lots of fastboat services to the gilis. most companies include free mainland pickups/dropoff services, often direct hotel, from ubud and all major southern resorts.
book your tickets once in bali for best prices.
should note that overall travel time (ubud pickup, road transfer to padangbai, wait around, boat journey) ubud to gili t is ~ 3.5hrs.
this isn’t too bad on the way out because you will reach gili t around 10:30/10:45
problem is return. because the fastboats are roundtrip services after gili t they go round the other gilis, compulsory stop on lombok, before returning to bali.
this means that the return boat service from gili t to the mainland can be 2:45 then you have road transfers which can take a couple of hours depending on where you are going.
return services only start when the first boat arrives around 11am-12 noon. overall you can assume at least 4 hours return journey time at best.
alternative - amed
if you want fall in the water snorkeling then look at amed.
only 2hrs or so drive from ubud. we sometimes do ubud - amed - gilis.
amed is a large area. the beaches aren’t white sand “caribbean idyll”. more a sand/stone mix.
it is a large area. we stay in jemeluk bay. the largest area with most places to eat/drink/stay.
as a flavour we stay at www.kembalibeachbungalows.nl
just walk out, fall in the water and snorkel. often see turtles. lots of fish. seen morays, stonefish (dangerous) and the odd baracuda. nemos etc. even seen juvenile blacktip sharks in front of the 
area is very paid back.
above main jemeluk beach is 
good place for a bite to eat and views. probably has the best views from a yoga deck in whole bali.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g294226-i7220-k13472472-Bali_Best_beach_Gili_Which_one_vs_Nusa-Bali.html,Bali- Best beach?

best places stay based personal interests. certain sights activities best done certain places. much size bali 5280sqkm - times size greater manchester. put together poor roads traffic, won’t average much 30kmh, ages anywhere.
purely example bali mainly diving, snorkeling chillaxing. stay areas (amed east coast, pemuteran, gili islands nusa lembongan). amed every year. 90kms dps takes 3hr transfer.
ubud popular good base sightseeing activities. people choose visit kuta etc. 30km usually takes 1h30 day. traffic horrendous “down south”.
as far visiting doesn’t look promising honest, somewhat ironically, china mooted possibly countries indonesia sort “travel corridor”.
other known/to considered entry criteria be. different depending come from.
could include any/some/combination -ve test, covid vaccine, compulsory quarantine arrival.
you account rules countries transit.
as example generally fly bali singapore airlines. last year height pandemic singapore banned european travelers transiting changi airport.
and course uks travel advice/regulations including right travel quarantine return. travel ban travel insurance invalid.
we “hoping” november don’t need plan “lastminute.com” eventually fulfil entry “exit” critera.

firstly denpasar is just the administrative capital. not a tourist destination. dps airport is actually in tuban which is the start of the huge tuban/kuta/legian/seminyak urban tourist strip.
mengwi is a place near taman ayung temple (one of our favourite places to visit) but is also an area. it is a narrow but somewhat long dragged out area. covers about 1km of beach between canggu and tanah lot but stretches over 20km inland.
best places to stay should be based on your own personal interests. certain sights and activities are best done from certain places. this is much to do with the size of bali 5280sqkm - over 4 times the size of greater manchester. put this together with the poor roads and traffic, where you won’t average much more than 30kmh, it can take ages to get anywhere.
purely as an example we go to bali mainly for the diving, snorkeling and chillaxing. so stay in those areas (amed on the east coast, pemuteran, gili islands and nusa lembongan). we are in amed every year. it is only 90kms from dps but takes 3hr transfer.
ubud is popular and also a good base for sightseeing and some activities. some people choose to visit from kuta etc. it is only 30km or so but usually takes 1h30 during the day. traffic is horrendous “down south”.
as far as visiting it doesn’t look promising and to be honest, somewhat ironically, china has been mooted as possibly one of the first countries with whom indonesia will have some sort of “travel corridor”.
other things not known/to be considered are what the entry criteria will be. again this may be different depending on where you come from.
could include any/some/combination of -ve test, covid vaccine, compulsory quarantine on arrival.
you also have to take into account the rules of the countries you transit.
as an example we generally fly to bali with singapore airlines. last year at the height of the pandemic singapore even banned european travelers from transiting at changi airport.
and of course the uks own travel advice/regulations including right to travel and quarantine on return. may or may not still have a travel ban and any travel insurance may be invalid.
we are “hoping” for november but we don’t need to plan and will do it all a bit “lastminute.com” when eventually we fulfil all the entry and “exit” critera.

it’s clear snow festival ahead i’d book cancellable accommodation off-chance don’t end getting screwed last-minute once!
when sensible time book room, e.g. 5th-10th february 2022? (day trips asahikawa otaru)?
we could spend 14-17 days considering something roughly following:
days 1-5 : sapporo/otaru/asahikawa
days 6-9 : rusutsu skiing
days 10-11 : abashiri
days 12-14: furano skiing
days 15-17 : tokyo hakodate ???
we visited japan times previously spent september 2018 hokkaido adored, speak basic japanese fully vaccinated.
i disregarded niseko sounds “international” don’t fancy ski resort full australians tbh. stick hokkaido split honshu?
any tips welcome!","2021 is clearly a write-off for visiting japan but hopefully 2022 will be a bit better, it’s maybe unlikely but my partner and i would love to visit hokkaido in february 2022 to see the sapporo snow festival, do some skiing, eat loads of great food, see the drift ice, soak in onsets etc.
it’s not clear if the snow festival will go ahead but i’d like to book some cancellable accommodation on the off-chance so that i don’t end up getting screwed last-minute for once!

we have visited japan 4 times previously and spent september 2018 in hokkaido which we adored, i speak basic japanese and we are both fully vaccinated.
i disregarded niseko as it sounds too “international” and i don’t fancy a ski resort full of australians tbh. should we stick to hokkaido or split between there and honshu?

overall your itin looks fine.
have skiied in both niseko (4 times) and rusutsu (once). more better runs in former than latter. hv also bumped into aussie skiers in those other than hakuba, nozawa onsen etc in japan. the long (aussie) holiday season should have finished by end jan so there might be less in feb.
besides, i prefer the onsens and dining options in niseko than in rusutsu.

avoid july/august as it can be unbearably hot and humid and you could spend half your time hiding in shops just to take advantage of the air conditioning.
the last time i went was in october and it was beautiful weather.
i would say do your own thing and be flexible with travels. if you have 4 to 6 weeks then you don't have to book the whole trip in one go or if you do just make sure that you have free cancellation then if you want to stay a little longer somewhere or make a detour then you can. there is lots to see.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g294232-i525-k13504103-4_to_6_weeks_in_Japan_2022-Japan.html,4 to 6 weeks in Japan 2022,Daizy R,AU,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/twojacksjackie?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,100,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,100,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,100,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,100,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,40000,"[""['guide',"", ""'easy',"", ""'japan',"", ""'flexibility',"", ""'japan',"", ""'one',"", ""'safest',"", ""'countries',"", ""'ever',"", ""'people',"", ""'super',"", ""'helpful',"", ""'reserve',"", ""'time',"", ""'japan',"", ""'bee',"", ""'3',"", ""'time',"", ""'avoid',"", ""'july',"", ""'august',"", ""'unbearably',"", ""'hot',"", ""'humid',"", ""'spend',"", ""'half',"", ""'time',"", ""'hide',"", ""'shop',"", ""'advantage',"", ""'air',"", ""'time',"", ""'october',"", ""'beautiful',"", ""'weather',"", ""'flexible',"", ""'travel',"", ""'4',"", ""'6',"", ""'weeks',"", ""'book',"", ""'whole',"", ""'trip',"", ""'one',"", ""'free',"", ""'cancellation',"", ""'stay',"", ""'little',"", ""'longer',"", ""'detour',"", ""'lot',"", ""'see']""]",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

in general, highway bus drivers japan much cautious (than elsewhere world). steering speeds 60-80km/h expressways less swerving. taken b/w nagoya <> takayama (in hours well 10 years ago), tokyo <> fuji 5-lake (2 hrs+) elsewhere japan ski resorts many times.

note khp (as recommended earlier) saves complete round trip osaka. one-way travel onomichi/hiroshima only, buy single shinkansen highway bus ticket.
also, hiroshima airport serves asia destinations only.

in general, highway bus drivers in japan are much more cautious (than elsewhere in the world). steering speeds might be around 60-80km/h even on expressways and less swerving. have taken those b/w say nagoya <> takayama (in 3 hours though well over 10 years ago), tokyo <> fuji 5-lake (2 hrs+) and elsewhere in japan such as to ski resorts many times.

note that the khp (as recommended earlier) saves if you complete a round trip from osaka. for one-way travel to onomichi/hiroshima only, just buy single shinkansen or highway bus ticket.
also, the hiroshima airport only serves a few asia destinations only.

try to study basic japanese etiquette; there are plenty of youtube videos on this topic.
when to go? check the climate data for japan. the summer is hot and humid. fall and spring are pleasant. try to avoid major japanese holiday periods, which are heavy travel periods for the japanese. i've tried august (way too hot and humid), september (still too humid), october (comfortable), and november (comfortable if you don't mind an occasional chill). there are typhoons in the fall, but i'd rather have a rainy day than a week of high humidity. see  .
where to stay? hotel rooms tend to be small. almost all neighborhoods are safe, so you can go cheap and still have a clean room in a safe area. i stay mostly at the toyoko inn hotel chain, where you get a tiny but clean room and free breakfast. it's a convenience to have a little refrigerator in the room, a microwave in the lobby, and coin-operated laundry machines; toyoko inns have them all. for other hotels, the rakuten travel website is a good start.
the japanese train system has excellent english signage and offers reliable service. you can find train schedules at www.hyperdia.com. consider the national japan rail pass and/or one of the regional rail passes.
if you want to see the katsura imperial villa garden in kyoto, you will need to make a reservation in advance.
consider adding nagasaki to your itinerary; the dejima museum is excellent. for more ideas of places to visit on kyushu, see

some quiet beaches would be good too!",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g293916-i3687-k13578206-Driving_Bangkok_to_Surat_Thani-Bangkok.html,Driving Bangkok to Surat Thani,heva34,UK,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/heva34?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,100,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,100,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,20000,"[""['drive',"", ""'stop',"", ""'waterfalls',"", ""'temples',"", ""'frequent',"", ""'tourists',"", ""'real',"", ""'authentic',"", ""'thai',"", ""'food',"", ""'way',"", ""'meet',"", ""'people',"", ""'adventure',"", ""'instead',"", ""'usual',"", ""'flight',"", ""'phuket',"", ""'surat',"", ""'thani',"", ""'rest',"", ""'tourists',"", ""'quiet',"", ""'beach',"", ""'good']""]",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

i'd travel khao lak, daughter wants tsunami museum not. enjoy chasing waterfalls hip deep tourists.
many thanks","so we were supposed to be in khao lak for christmas and new year. obviously that didn't happen.
we've bumped it and are booked into the arinara (i'm aware it's closed atm) for christmas 2021.
without this descending into an argument about vaccines/quarantine. if we can't fly there or go without quarantine, tui will simply cancel it and i'll get my thousands back or amend the booking. i'm already vaccinated and had covid a year ago with a packet of paracetamol the solution.
is it easy to get a local private 'guide'.
i know i can book tours etc but i'm looking for maybe 2 days of travel, in a car, with just us 3.
google tells me average taxi driver earns 107 thb daily, grab driver 150thb daily.
i'd be happy to pay 200 -250 thb an hour if they don't drive like life is a roller coaster. english or german speaking at basic level also a bonus.
is this feasible?
am i being cheap and should i expect to pay much more? am i better off just asking locals or are there established companies that offer these services?
i'd like to travel up to khao lak, my daughter wants to go back to the tsunami museum and what not. we also enjoy chasing waterfalls that are not hip deep in tourists.

big disadvantage i have is a lack of technical it ability. i don't have line and have no i-phone or i-pad. i'm just an old fashioned laptop user.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g293915-i3686-k13475457-ASQ_report-Thailand.html,ASQ report,MOTALAW,CA,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MOTALAW?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,50,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,50,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,200,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,50,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,50,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,50,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,200,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,52500,"[""['report',"", ""'craig',"", ""'read',"", ""'good',"", ""'rest',"", ""'thailand',"", ""'trip',"", ""'hotel',"", ""'sound',"", ""'good',"", ""'7',"", ""'11',"", ""'microwave',"", ""'hot',"", ""'snack',"", ""'imo',"", ""'asq',"", ""'hotels',"", ""'stay',"", ""'rest',"", ""'early',"", ""'part',"", ""'2022',"", ""'november',"", ""'winter',"", ""'covid',"", ""'hit',"", ""'britain',"", ""'appealling',"", ""'glamorous',"", ""'weather',"", ""'girl',"", ""'tv',"", ""'endure',"", ""'coldest',"", ""'january',"", ""'10',"", ""'2011',"", ""'spend',"", ""'january',"", ""'bangkok',"", ""'miss',"", ""'cold',"", ""'weather',"", ""'time',"", ""'big',"", ""'disadvantage',"", ""'lack',"", ""'technical',"", ""'ability',"", ""'line',"", ""'phone',"", ""'pad',"", ""'old',"", ""'fashion',"", ""'laptop',"", ""'user']""]",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

guessing op would be a tourist...hence the vid of a tourist area.
i can show a vid of the surfside rd here (pkk), dead during weekdays, but one street over, less than 100 meters away, also running parallel to the surf, and you'd never know there's a pandemic.
i'm pretty sure people can think for themselves, as we all state ""tourist areas' relying on 'international tourism' (patong beach / bangla rd) are affected. not everyday living in more local areas, as more normal. people still work, eat, shop & even party.

edited: 5:34 am, march 04,","i'd suggest you seek-out hand-dived or farmed shellfish as dredging does a lot of damage to the marine ecosystem and there are already large areas off the west of scotland under dredging bans to try and let the seabed recover after years of over-dredging.
although it shouldn't be any problem in may, you should also be aware that there have been bans on landing and warnings placed on the consumption of inshore scottish shellfish as a result of blue-green algae, which can be toxic in even tiny amounts and is most likely to occur in the high-summer months of the hottest summers.

i booked on the skybus and when i got to lands end airport about 10:00 there was thick fog and no flights. it hadn't cleared by early afternoon and the forecast for the following day was for high winds which meant travel on the scillonian was also doubtful. so i cut my losses, phoned the heliport and managed to get on a late afternoon flight. thick fog at st just but a perfectly clear day in penzance and at st marys
from memory the skybus was about £85 each way and the single helicopter flight was about £130 (i came back via skybus). without the helicopter i’d have lost 1 or 2 days of my 4 day trip.

3 get fully insured against the prospect of regularly cancelled flights, disruption and expense
friends of ours found themselves camped down in the church hall overnight like refugees but without the sally army providing tea, or better still go by helicopter or ferry, its your best bet. hope this helps",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g186309-i1326-k13490206-Chopper_or_sky_bus-Isles_of_Scilly_England.html,Chopper or sky bus,Stuart T,0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stuarttQ9761YB?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,200,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,50,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,200,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,42500,"[""['short',"", ""'question',"", ""'slightest',"", ""'hint',"", ""'fog',"", ""'whole',"", ""'fall',"", ""'must',"", ""'plane',"", ""'top',"", ""'tip',"", ""'1',"", ""'plan',"", ""'travel',"", ""'home',"", ""'saturday',"", ""'worst',"", ""'vagrant',"", ""'monday',"", ""'2',"", ""'weather',"", ""'airport',"", ""'day',"", ""'departure',"", ""'limit',"", ""'capacity',"", ""'ferry',"", ""'cross',"", ""'straight',"", ""'alternative',"", ""'3',"", ""'fully',"", ""'insure',"", ""'prospect',"", ""'regularly',"", ""'cancel',"", ""'flight',"", ""'disruption',"", ""'expense',"", ""'friends',"", ""'camp',"", ""'church',"", ""'hall',"", ""'overnight',"", ""'refugees',"", ""'sally',"", ""'army',"", ""'provide',"", ""'tea',"", ""'helicopter',"", ""'ferry',"", ""'bet',"", ""'help']""]",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

i guess one of the bonuses of llandudno is that most of the attractions are grouped together either on or very close the great orme (there's also a ski slope and toboggan run which you'll see if you get onto the cable car) so even without a car you should have no problem getting from place to place.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g190724-i837-k13644671-2_days_to_organise-Llandudno_Conwy_County_North_Wales_Wales.html,2 days to organise,cowbag,Stamford,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cowbag?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,100.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,100,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,100.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,100,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,100,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,50000,"[""['tram',"", ""'cable',"", ""'car',"", ""'run',"", ""'bottom',"", ""'orme',"", ""'summit',"", ""'complex',"", ""'top',"", ""'start',"", ""'different',"", ""'place',"", ""'less',"", ""'destination',"", ""'tram',"", ""'split',"", ""'two',"", ""'section',"", ""'one',"", ""'base',"", ""'halfway',"", ""'station',"", ""'one',"", ""'halfway',"", ""'station',"", ""'summit',"", ""'complex',"", ""'quite',"", ""'close',"", ""'halfway',"", ""'station',"", ""'pier',"", ""'entrance',"", ""'close',"", ""'base',"", ""'orme',"", ""'tramway',"", ""'cable',"", ""'cars',"", ""'pier',"", ""'geographically',"", ""'close',"", ""'vintage',"", ""'coach',"", ""'tour',"", ""'marine',"", ""'drive',"", ""'depart',"", ""'pier',"", ""'entrance',"", ""'tour',"", ""'hour',"", ""'include',"", ""'run',"", ""'commentary',"", ""'see',"", ""'lot',"", ""'notice',"", ""'car',"", ""'pier',"", ""'open',"", ""'fairly',"", ""'late',"", ""'whereas',"", ""'tram',"", ""'cable',"", ""'car',"", ""'limit',"", ""'open',"", ""'hours',"", ""'easily',"", ""'place',"", ""'day',"", ""'guess',"", ""'one',"", ""'bonuses',"", ""'llandudno',"", ""'attractions',"", ""'group',"", ""'together',"", ""'close',"", ""'orme',"", ""'ski',"", ""'slope',"", ""'toboggan',"", ""'run',"", ""'see',"", ""'onto',"", ""'cable',"", ""'car',"", ""'car',"", ""'problem',"", ""'place',"", ""'place']""]",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

edited: 6:29 am, january 29,","just to add that ferry from mallaig to skye does not go off anywhere near is often as it did three or four years back when the normal ferry went in for repairs and it was replaced by a ferry that was not suitable at certain tides so it was often cancelled even when the weather was fine . prior to this this wasn't the case and it was only cancelled due to bad weather and for the last couple of years it hasn't been the case either and it is back to be cancellations for weather reasons. it is of course still worth checking but easy enough to change your plans at the start of the day when you reach fort william :-).

i really wouldn't change any plans over a situation that was occurring two or three years ago or panic over the weather having an affect on crossings between april and october although yes it can happen but you would be unlucky.

we are an american couple (husband/wife), late 50s, in good health.
we are considering a trip to england this christmas and new year’s (we will have about 9 days).
our primary interests are natural beauty (one author called these “healing views”), i.e., coastline walks and hikes as well as inland walks, e.g., along rivers, gentle rolling hills, etc. we also enjoy cathedrals and history. we assume southern england would be better at that time of year than farther north.
first question: where do you recommend that we focus our attention? i’m thinking of cornwall, devon/dorset, isle of wight, south downs, or kent.

at the risk of repeating what others have said, this is not a plan which many brits would actively recommend and it has a some known and predictable constraints (such as length of day, limited - or some days zero - public transport, food shops closed or with limited hours, restaurants shut or concentrating on festive parties, closure of visitor attractions) combined with the unpredictability of the weather (which may go from delightful to dreary within one day).
that said, here’s what i’d recommend to my own american friends.
use the first and ninth days as buffers and treat this as a one week holiday. take the train to somewhere where you can pick up a hire car and drive to a single, comfortable self-catering house or cottage, for the week. en route, do one ‘big shop’ at a supermarket to cover most of the week’s food. (bear in mind that before christmas and new year some roads and trains get very busy as people congregate from distant parts for seasonal family celebrations and that food shops are likewise busy with people stocking up.)
use your home as a base for daily sorties to local coasts, rivers, woods, moors…. keep things flexible, planning each day the day before and using what are by then the excellent short-term weather forecasts issued, for instance, by the met office.
personally my chosen venue would be the lovely estuary town of dartmouth in south devon, my home county. car pick-up probably in exeter. my family have done exactly what i’ve described above a couple of times (without the transatlantic flight and long train journey!) and had a great time. here you have a complete variety of possible coastal, river, woodland and moorland day walks almost on your doorstop, close enough to your base to allow for complete flexibility and in a town which is pleasant just to stroll around for an hour or so if the weather turns.
second choice would be the delightful coastal town of sidmouth in east devon. or lyme regis or swanage in dorset.
but to echo some other comments above, i’d go in may or september unless december was the only option.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g186217-i16-k13636157-Christmas_Holiday_and_Hiking_in_Southern_England-England.html,Christmas Holiday and Hiking in Southern England,Rogeroos,IN,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rogeroos?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,134,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,134,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,300,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,134,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,56934,"[""['john',"", ""'welcome',"", ""'forum',"", ""'risk',"", ""'repeat',"", ""'others',"", ""'plan',"", ""'many',"", ""'brits',"", ""'actively',"", ""'recommend',"", ""'predictable',"", ""'constraints',"", ""'length',"", ""'day',"", ""'limit',"", ""'days',"", ""'zero',"", ""'public',"", ""'transport',"", ""'food',"", ""'shop',"", ""'close',"", ""'limit',"", ""'hours',"", ""'restaurants',"", ""'shut',"", ""'concentrate',"", ""'festive',"", ""'party',"", ""'closure',"", ""'visitor',"", ""'attractions',"", ""'combine',"", ""'unpredictability',"", ""'weather',"", ""'may',"", ""'delightful',"", ""'dreary',"", ""'one',"", ""'day',"", ""'here’s',"", ""'i’d',"", ""'recommend',"", ""'american',"", ""'friends',"", ""'ninth',"", ""'days',"", ""'buffer',"", ""'treat',"", ""'one',"", ""'week',"", ""'holiday',"", ""'train',"", ""'pick',"", ""'hire',"", ""'car',"", ""'drive',"", ""'single',"", ""'comfortable',"", ""'self',"", ""'cater',"", ""'house',"", ""'cottage',"", ""'week',"", ""'en',"", ""'route',"", ""'one',"", ""'‘big',"", ""'shop’',"", ""'supermarket',"", ""'cover',"", ""'week’s',"", ""'food',"", ""'bear',"", ""'mind',"", ""'christmas',"", ""'new',"", ""'roads',"", ""'train',"", ""'busy',"", ""'people',"", ""'congregate',"", ""'distant',"", ""'part',"", ""'seasonal',"", ""'family',"", ""'celebrations',"", ""'food',"", ""'shop',"", ""'likewise',"", ""'busy',"", ""'people',"", ""'stock',"", ""'home',"", ""'base',"", ""'daily',"", ""'sorties',"", ""'local',"", ""'coast',"", ""'rivers',"", ""'woods',"", ""'moors…',"", ""'keep',"", ""'flexible',"", ""'plan',"", ""'day',"", ""'day',"", ""'excellent',"", ""'short',"", ""'term',"", ""'weather',"", ""'forecast',"", ""'instance',"", ""'meet',"", ""'office',"", ""'personally',"", ""'venue',"", ""'estuary',"", ""'town',"", ""'dartmouth',"", ""'south',"", ""'devon',"", ""'home',"", ""'county',"", ""'car',"", ""'pick',"", ""'exeter',"", ""'family',"", ""'exactly',"", ""'i’ve',"", ""'describe',"", ""'couple',"", ""'time',"", ""'transatlantic',"", ""'flight',"", ""'long',"", ""'train',"", ""'journey',"", ""'time',"", ""'complete',"", ""'variety',"", ""'coastal',"", ""'river',"", ""'woodland',"", ""'moorland',"", ""'day',"", ""'walk',"", ""'doorstop',"", ""'close',"", ""'base',"", ""'allow',"", ""'complete',"", ""'flexibility',"", ""'town',"", ""'pleasant',"", ""'stroll',"", ""'hour',"", ""'weather',"", ""'turn',"", ""'second',"", ""'choice',"", ""'delightful',"", ""'coastal',"", ""'town',"", ""'sidmouth',"", ""'east',"", ""'devon',"", ""'lyme',"", ""'regis',"", ""'swanage',"", ""'dorset',"", ""'echo',"", ""'comment',"", ""'i’d',"", ""'may',"", ""'september',"", ""'december']""]",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

if you like the idea of the england and scotland tour - i'd not book it - i suspect you'd be able to reproduce parts of it for considerably less than the tour operator is charging. travelling by rail would be much more pleasant than sitting on a coach whizzing past a sight, and choosing one's accommodation is definitely a plus.

you also have to take into account all your flight transit countries. even if bali opens it is possible your transit countries may not allow you in even for transit (as happened with singapore last year who banned many countries even from transit).

we do like walking, eating out, relaxing and exploring.
some questions:
is 6 nights gili t too long? we would do day trips to other islands
is it worth moving from kuta to seminyak for a couple of nights as they look so close.

903,4482,ID,"hi,
how many days total overall plans.
given “implied” itinerary consider
ubud - “an island” - “southern resort”
this popular itinerary order.
this order finish closer airport.
also going gilis far order way fastboat services run.
gilis small flat islands. much except diving, snorkeling chillaxing. gili rep partying stay away area.
you cycle whole island 40mins
we often gili (from amed) diving/snorkeling chillaxing.
other islands easier nusa lembongan nusa penida.
lembongan tourist infrastructure chillaxing.
penida isn’t overdeveloped tourismwise choice accommodation limited comparison.
penida place walking/sightseeing.
fastboats
fastboats islands padangbai, sanur, serangan amed (gilis only).
you need arrange transport to/from port.
all fastboat services include sort free pickup dropoff services. often direct accommodation.
these pickup/dropoff services often include ubud “southern resorts”.
some services padangbai offer pickups candidasa.
amed services gilis amed only.
there interisland services. gili - nusa lembongan/penida service.
as example got corona’d 2020 daughter due daddy/daughter diving/chillaxing trip.
we going amed - gili - nusa lembongan - sanur kuta.
in november 2020 big family trip (me, mrs pig, daughter/son bf/wife) ubud - amed - gilis - lembongan - sanur/kuta (after mrs pig due perth/rottnes island)
kuta/legian/seminyak
as mentioned worth moving kuta seminyak. distinct places. kuta/legian/seminyak large urban tourist sprawl located along long kuta beach. kuta merges legian seminyak crossing road bar/shop another. legian middle covers ~ 1mile beachfront. seminyak closer beachwalk mall kuta seminyak square.
sanur option “southern resort”.
it large tourist area withthe usual wide range tourist accommodation, restaurants, bars doesn’t nightclubs pretentious beachclubs
itinerary
bali big island add islands lot variety.
thing travel time bali slow going. generally won’t average much 20mph away congested south ubud town often walking pace.
as example kuta/dps ubud 25miles usually takes 1h30.
we transfer directly amed landing. barely 60miles usually takes 3hrs stopping. amed diving/snorkeling/chillaxing instance tirta gangga water palace orpura lempuyang temple 30mins.
it 2h30 straight drive kuta 1h30 ubud.
similarly visit waterfalls north good 3hrs+ straight drive kuta. closer ubud. closer lovina.
if wanted whitewater rafting, cycle tours best done ubud.
have see/do.
that ultimately determine itinerary, best stay order it.","hi,
how many days in total and what are your overall plans.
given your “implied” itinerary then consider
ubud - “an island” - “southern resort”
this is a popular itinerary and in that order.
this is a better order as you finish closer to the airport.
also if going to the gilis this is far better order because of the way the fastboat services run.
gilis are small flat islands. not much to do except diving, snorkeling and chillaxing. gili t has a rep for partying but can stay away from that area.
you can cycle around the whole island in 40mins
we often go to gili t (from amed) but go for the diving/snorkeling and chillaxing.
other islands easier to get to are nusa lembongan and nusa penida.
lembongan has more tourist infrastructure and is more for chillaxing.
penida isn’t overdeveloped tourismwise so choice of accommodation is limited in comparison.
penida is the place for walking/sightseeing.
fastboats
fastboats to the islands go out of padangbai, sanur, serangan and amed (gilis only).
you do not need to arrange your own transport to/from any port.
all fastboat services include some sort of free pickup and dropoff services. this is often direct accommodation.
these pickup/dropoff services often include ubud and all “southern resorts”.
some services out of padangbai offer pickups in candidasa.
amed services to gilis is amed only.
there are also some interisland services. there is a gili - nusa lembongan/penida service.
as an example before we got corona’d in may 2020 myself and daughter were due to do a daddy/daughter diving/chillaxing trip.
we were going to do amed - gili t - nusa lembongan - sanur or kuta.
in november 2020 we had a big family trip (me, mrs pig, daughter/son and bf/wife) and do ubud - amed - gilis - lembongan - sanur/kuta (after which myself and mrs pig were due to go to perth/rottnes island)
kuta/legian/seminyak
as mentioned it is not worth moving from kuta to seminyak. not really 2 distinct places. kuta/legian/seminyak is just a large urban tourist sprawl located along the long kuta beach. kuta merges into legian into seminyak just by crossing the road from one bar/shop to another. legian in the middle only covers ~ 1mile of beachfront. you can actually be in seminyak and be closer to the beachwalk mall in kuta than seminyak square.
sanur is another option as “southern resort”.
it is a large tourist area withthe usual wide range of tourist accommodation, restaurants, bars etc however doesn’t have nightclubs or pretentious beachclubs
itinerary
bali is a big island and once you add in islands there is a lot of variety.
thing is travel time in bali is slow going. you generally won’t average much more than 20mph even away from the congested south and ubud town where it can often be at walking pace.
as an example kuta/dps to ubud is only 25miles but usually takes 1h30.
we transfer directly to amed on landing. it is barely 60miles but usually takes 3hrs without stopping. we go to amed for the diving/snorkeling/chillaxing but for instance we can get to tirta gangga water palace orpura lempuyang temple in 30mins.
it would take 2h30 straight drive from kuta or 1h30 from ubud.
similarly if you would like to visit the waterfalls in the north they are a good 3hrs+ straight drive from kuta. closer if you go from ubud. even closer if you go from lovina.
if you wanted to do things like whitewater rafting, cycle tours then these are best done from ubud.
have a think about what you would like to see/do.
that will ultimately determine your itinerary, where best to stay and which order to do it.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g294226-i7220-k13559698-Bali_Gilli_T_Itinerary_Help_please-Bali.html,Bali & Gilli T - Itinerary Help

the downside pov don’t fall water snorkeling amed person course days others occupy themselves.","hi,
if doing your diving certification is part of your trip then bali is a good option.
i dive, daughter dives and wife likes to snorkel. we are (non covid) in bali every year and diving/snorkeling forms a major part of our holidays. we generally stay at the major diving areas like amed, gili islands, nusa lembongan.
our plans for may 2020 and november 2020 was
amed - gili islands - nusa lembongan - sanur/kuta (november was also due to fly to oz after bali).
amed
amed is an area on the east coast. it is popular for diving/snorkeling and chillaxing. it is not a built up tourist resort area. very laid back.
diving is cheap.
we stay at www.kembalibeachbungalows.nl
for a big family trip (me, mrs pig, son and wife, daughter and boyfriend) we were going to book the www.balibeachhouse.com next door until we got corona’d. the property is available on airbnb.
easy snorkeling straight in front of these properties. fall in the water. no organised trips.
the reef is barely 10m from shore snorkeling 1m above the reef.
as well as normal colourful small fishies often see turtles. also seen moray eels, stonefish (dangerous) even baracuda.
a few years ago some juvenile black tip reef sharks (completely harmless) took up residence in the shallow reef in front of the  50m down the beach.
i dive a site called pyramids (in front of kembali) and have seen some white tip sharks. shy and harmless. seen a lot more on gili t.
diving - amed
we have dived for many years with www.adventurediversbali.com
located more or less across the road from kembali.
run by a brit/belgian couple.
there is also www.balidivecove.com
this is run by a brit girl called jordan and her balinese husband. now our dive centre of choice. we have known her for many years, she used to work for adventure divers but we first met her and dived with her in malta many years ago.
she is a fully qualified padi diving instructor.
often after qualifying as an open water diver and/or as part of your qualification dives you will be taken to tulamben (20mins down the road) to dive on the usat liberty. one of well known world dive sites
dive courses - open water diver
open water is the first level of qualified certification. diving down to 18m.
to make life easier you can do all the theory online at home and print off a completion certificate. you then bring that with you to bali. this reduces the number of days you need to complete the course down to 2.5 days.
padi charges for this.
ssi doesn’t charge but you need to then use an ssi registered dive centre e.g. adventure divers.
padi & ssi are basically the same accepted throughout the world.
diving with mantas - nusa penida
mantas can be seen off manta bay and manta point off nusa penida.
manta bay is often awash with snorkel boat trips although also dive trips but for a new diver can be a bit overwhelming with so many people and importantly so many boats on the surface.
manta point better but the problem with nusa penida is that because of strong currents some dive sites are for advance open water divers only with a lot of experience.
nusa lembongan
this island close to southern bali and penida is a popular place to stay. can do diving courses. also get diving and snorkel trips to nusa penida.
on lembongan  is a brit run dive centre offering courses and diving.
holiday booking
how do you intend to book your holiday. if you intend to do a typical “uk” package holiday then you can forget going to amed or other places good for diving/snorkeling.
you will be very restricted on choice of places to stay. often limited to the southern beach resorts and ubud.
if you want to book independently (like we and most people here do) then very easy to fit in a lot.
fastboats
there are lots of fastboat services between bali and the islands and sometimes between the islands.
e.g. as i mentioned amed - gilis - nusa lembongan - sanur/kuta is a thing we do.
fastboat services usually include free bali mainland pickup/dropoff services, often direct hotel/property from the major tourist places like ubud and the southern resorts of sanur, kuta, legian, seminyak, nusa dua/benoa.
although amed isn’t a major tourist centre there are fastboat services from amed to gilis. shortest crossing.
if you want to keep your holiday a bit simpler then ubud - nusa lembongan - “southern resort” is a popular combo.
can do cultural stuff/sightseeing around ubud then go off to lembongan with a company like www.rockyfastcruise.com who will pick you up in ubud, drop you off at your nl accommodation then pick you up again on return.

edited: 9:01 am, february 19,","like all sensible bali ta users i wholeheartedly agree with nps above. my hubby and i have travelled to indonesia since we got certified in 2008. it is absolutely superb and incredibly reasonably priced. as well as his recommendations for bali, i would recommend liberty dive resort by the liberty wreck as a fantastic dive experience with wonderful guides and beautiful accomodation. diving with manta rays is almost guaranteed in nusa penida which can be accessed on day trips from eastern bali, so padang bai or candidasa. another really nice place to base yourselves for diving is padang bai. we have stayed in absolute scuba several times. i would also recommend that you book the property yourselves, either direct with them or via booking.com or agoda. a uk travel agency may well not send you to the best places for diving.

we generally dives morning afternoon off.","i’ve also stayed at the liberty dive resort with my diving daughter. would also recommend it if you were all there to do nothing but dive.
thing is as you are a family tulamben isn’t the place for non-divers whilst somebody is spending the days learning or diving.
tulamben is very much dive central. ideal if you are doing nothing else but dive. there is no beach just a volcanic large stone shore. there is often surge on shore which makes it difficult to get in and out even as an adult just snorkeling let alone in dive gear as a new diver. would not recommended it for young kids.
if you stay in jemeluk, amed you will have more of a choice to eat/drink etc. a beach. easy snorkeling even for the kids. more to occupy oneself whilst one person is learning to dive.

is there a central part it head to?

if l was going to bali for one week l would also go carry on, some airlines allow more carry on weight than others but most will allow that small carry on case and a small back pack, it has worked for me on numerous occasions to london and it is hassle free. just buy another small case for return should you need it.
all toiletries are plentiful and available as required, l usually ask my driver to stop at a supermarket on the way to my hotel in ubud, they really don’t mind stopping somewhere. i also buy an entire crate of bottled water as l hate running out and use it for washing face and teeth.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g294226-i7220-k13582367-1st_time_to_Bali_Ubud_from_US_solo_female_early_40s-Bali.html,"1st time to Bali (Ubud) from US (solo female, early 40s)",Janice,0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/janC1572KA?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,300,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,300,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,68978,"[""['it’s',"", ""'huge',"", ""'help',"", ""'collection',"", ""'include',"", ""'bali',"", ""'weather',"", ""'l',"", ""'experience',"", ""'india',"", ""'type',"", ""'humidity',"", ""'type',"", ""'pant',"", ""'hot',"", ""'cotton',"", ""'sundresses',"", ""'everyday',"", ""'lm',"", ""'l',"", ""'yoga',"", ""'l',"", ""'extremely',"", ""'lightweight',"", ""'tights',"", ""'nike',"", ""'reebok',"", ""'super',"", ""'light',"", ""'weather',"", ""'pant',"", ""'pant',"", ""'walk',"", ""'hike',"", ""'everyday',"", ""'super',"", ""'colour',"", ""'design',"", ""'wear',"", ""'cotton',"", ""'shirt',"", ""'wash',"", ""'night',"", ""'dry',"", ""'overnight',"", ""'small',"", ""'bottle',"", ""'liquid',"", ""'soap',"", ""'wash',"", ""'cloths',"", ""'much',"", ""'buy',"", ""'bali',"", ""'spoil',"", ""'choice',"", ""'let’s',"", ""'it’s',"", ""'way',"", ""'covid',"", ""'l',"", ""'bali',"", ""'one',"", ""'week',"", ""'l',"", ""'carry',"", ""'airlines',"", ""'allow',"", ""'carry',"", ""'weight',"", ""'others',"", ""'allow',"", ""'small',"", ""'carry',"", ""'case',"", ""'small',"", ""'pack',"", ""'work',"", ""'numerous',"", ""'occasion',"", ""'london',"", ""'hassle',"", ""'free',"", ""'buy',"", ""'small',"", ""'case',"", ""'toiletries',"", ""'plentiful',"", ""'require',"", ""'l',"", ""'driver',"", ""'stop',"", ""'supermarket',"", ""'way',"", ""'hotel',"", ""'ubud',"", ""'don’t',"", ""'mind',"", ""'stop',"", ""'buy',"", ""'entire',"", ""'crate',"", ""'bottle',"", ""'water',"", ""'l',"", ""'hate',"", ""'run',"", ""'wash',"", ""'face',"", ""'teeth']""]",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

thanks in advance!",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g294225-i7219-k13506633-Nyuh_Ubud_or_Seminyak_for_Honeymoon-Indonesia.html,Nyuh Ubud or Seminyak for Honeymoon?,Chloe,0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chloelindsay97?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,100,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,100,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,100.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,100,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,100,100,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,60000,"[""['i’m',"", ""'book',"", ""'nyuh',"", ""'villas',"", ""'honeymoon',"", ""'feb',"", ""'2023',"", ""'wonder',"", ""'whether',"", ""'ubud',"", ""'site',"", ""'seminyak',"", ""'25',"", ""'30',"", ""'relax',"", ""'sight',"", ""'see',"", ""'eat',"", ""'good',"", ""'food',"", ""'opportunity',"", ""'access',"", ""'nearby',"", ""'resort',"", ""'day',"", ""'pass',"", ""'eg',"", ""'hard',"", ""'rock',"", ""'hotel',"", ""'experience',"", ""'events',"", ""'entertainment',"", ""'experience',"", ""'sit',"", ""'recommend',"", ""'stay',"", ""'february',"", ""'ideas',"", ""'advice',"", ""'may',"", ""'include',"", ""'typical',"", ""'weather',"", ""'advance']""]",False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

back for one night to amed. the thought here is to leave our luggage at the hotel in amed and just take a couple things to gili with us, so figured we would have to book another night at the hotel to do this. ( or any other ideas)?
then onto tulamben for two nights
then to ubud for a longer stay.
after ubud we will go south and thinking of candidasa 5 nights and then benoa for our last four nights to be close to the airport to fly back to bangkok
we have a month in total, but really wondering about this first part. is it too rushed?
should we add another night somewhere?
thanks so much.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g294226-i7220-k13565579-Does_this_sound_too_rushed-Bali.html,Does this sound too rushed?,travelling55,UK,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelling55?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,100,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,100,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,100,0,0.0,100,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,100,0,0,100,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,100,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,70000,"[""['problem',"", ""'isyou',"", ""'see',"", ""'expense',"", ""'busy',"", ""'plan',"", ""'part',"", ""'wonder',"", ""'try',"", ""'carve',"", ""'one',"", ""'night',"", ""'two',"", ""'women',"", ""'late',"", ""'sixties',"", ""'part',"", ""'husband',"", ""'join',"", ""'half',"", ""'way',"", ""'arrive',"", ""'canada',"", ""'october',"", ""'2022',"", ""'overnight',"", ""'bangkok',"", ""'break',"", ""'trip',"", ""'arrive',"", ""'bali',"", ""'5pm',"", ""'transfer',"", ""'directly',"", ""'amed',"", ""'two',"", ""'nights',"", ""'relax',"", ""'snorkel',"", ""'swim',"", ""'gili',"", ""'trawangan',"", ""'two',"", ""'nights',"", ""'focus',"", ""'snorkelling',"", ""'relax',"", ""'one',"", ""'night',"", ""'amed',"", ""'luggage',"", ""'hotel',"", ""'amed',"", ""'couple',"", ""'gili',"", ""'figure',"", ""'book',"", ""'night',"", ""'hotel',"", ""'ideas',"", ""'onto',"", ""'tulamben',"", ""'two',"", ""'nights',"", ""'ubud',"", ""'longer',"", ""'stay',"", ""'ubud',"", ""'south',"", ""'candidasa',"", ""'5',"", ""'nights',"", ""'benoa',"", ""'four',"", ""'nights',"", ""'close',"", ""'airport',"", ""'fly',"", ""'bangkok',"", ""'month',"", ""'total',"", ""'wonder',"", ""'part',"", ""'rush',"", ""'add',"", ""'night',"", ""'much']""]",False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

as luggage, amed hotel able hold you, not, driver amed transfer amed tulamben tulamben ubud. drivers used notapigsty vouch well, keep luggage safe. link below.
in opinion, tulamben worth couple days. i'm diver, (pre covid) spend 4-6 weeks there, least twice year. busy day trip divers, wreck, early much nicer. kubu seraya area snorkel well, minutes tulamben bay.
","going to amed directly after arrival at 5pm will see you getting to amed very late, it is 2.5-3 hours from the airport. so assuming you want to stop for dinner on the way, your arrival will be very late. and having just two nights will only give you one day in amed before going to gili t.
my suggestion is to stay the extra night in amed, giving you two full days there, before going to gili t. when you come back, transfer to tulamben.
as for your luggage, your amed hotel should be able to hold it for you, or if not, may i suggest you use my driver for your amed transfer and then amed to tulamben and tulamben to ubud. these drivers also used by notapigsty who will vouch for them as well, and he can keep your luggage safe. link below.
in my opinion, tulamben is worth a couple of days. i'm a diver, and (pre covid) we would spend 4-6 weeks there, at least twice a year. it can get busy with day trip divers, especially around the wreck, so being there early is much nicer. you can also go up to kubu or down to the seraya area to snorkel as well, both only a few minutes from tulamben bay.

our experiences in december is hot, humid, downpours, then maybe sunny, maybe overcast. sunsets will be hit and miss. occasionally the rain will spoil our plans for the day but life is very flexible in bali and just wait for a better day. we do not book anything till we’re on the ground in bali. i always take a pair of “throw away” shoes as roads can be flooded.
i have not visited in the month of march. june is just perfect in our experience.

it can be raining heavily in one area and barely a few kms await not a raindrop to be seen.
as an example where we go diving on the east coast at amed/tulamben this area is one of the driest regions of bali seeing very little rain in comparison to say ubud or south coast areas.
when it does rain in bali it is often heavy but lasts 5 or 10 mins then stops.

if living in london, relative, you may or may not like the big mango. i know my first few visits, i hated it, and thought it nothing more than a giant slum. although, i did stay on lower suk, and didn't explore much. if used to squeaky clean western hygiene (appearance / smells (lack of sewer), then you can easily be put off.
now, after so many visits (100+) and still haven't seen it all, as krung thep metro is huge, i love arriving. and after a short week, i love leaving .... 🤣🤣🤣
being there on weekend has its pros & cons, more festive & more things open, but crowded. if you enjoy just knocking around & exploring a city's non touristy side, you'll love it.
but .... since coming from a big city, if so, and wanting beach time, you may want to prioritize that on first visit, as big city feeling can be found at home. especially coming from uk, as any beach, even thai's crappy ones along with warm weather would be a relief, from what i hear & read.🤣
my first thai beach experience was 20+ years ago, phuket, and got me on thinking about retiring in thailand. trip was actually a recon for retirement. 2nd beach holiday was pp, and sealed the idea.
hindsight, and when thailand opens to 'normal' tourism, i think pp would be my priority, as slow starting up again, before it turns back into a tourist ghetto, i think i'd prioritize my first visit after c19 there. save extensive exploration of the big mango for a later visit, as any changes there, will be for the better as they are revamping some areas already, and quite nicely.
about to revisit pp myself, before 2022, as looking lovely without tourist.
good thing not into ""museums/galleries"" .... they really suck here.

thanks much","i realize i asked my question on the wrong forum yesterday. my husband loves to swim in the ocean a couple times a day, and does not like the pool. i will do either. he is 72 and i 67. we will be in thailand for a month and want to spend a week each at two different beach locations near the end. this will be end of november so i think koh samui is out, although i loved it there.
i am reading lots of reviews and they are so divided on whether it is a good swimming beach or not so good. five years ago i was on koh phi pi and also railey beach and loved them, but with girlfriends and other than excursions out we just used the pools
we want to be on a great swimming beach
not a party atmosphere but a bit lively is fine
walking distance to shops and resteraunts.
my thoughts are. phi phi. railey beach, klong muang. koh lanta.
or somewhere i have not thought of
hin hua did not really appeal to me
any guidance is.most appreciated. we will be taking tours out to snorkel and visit other areas while there. our budget is moderate, we don’t need fancy just clean. but a splurge now and then is okay too. the two i originally thought of was phi phi relax beachfront cabin and railay village resort. but now doubting myself

i'm also never quite sure what people mean when they say ""experience thai culture"", as if you're in thailand you're already experiencing thai culture, even if in a town catering to tourists. i mean if you want ""real"" thai culture then buy a meal from a 7-11 then sit and play on your cell phone for 3 hours, but i don't think that's what people mean. trying lots of different thai food is a good start and otherwise just be friendly to all the thais you meet along the way and have some small conversations (but be wary of the ones who are too friendly as they may have ulterior motives).
anyway to make a suggestion, i'm personally not a fan of hua hin as the beach is awful, but phuket/krabi area or samui are good starting places, which one depends on the time of year as they have different weather patterns.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g293916-i3687-k13559466-After_Bangkok_which_beach_or_island_would_you_recommend-Bangkok.html,After Bangkok which beach or island would you recommend?,DragonLass-Aus,AU,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DragonLass-Aus?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,100,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,100,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,100,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,100,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,40000,"[""['forums',"", ""'ideas',"", ""'mr',"", ""'cycle',"", ""'good',"", ""'summary',"", ""'touristy',"", ""'businesses',"", ""'set',"", ""'tour',"", ""'show',"", ""'speak',"", ""'reasonable',"", ""'level',"", ""'english',"", ""'thai',"", ""'harder',"", ""'tour',"", ""'thais',"", ""'recommend',"", ""'latter',"", ""'timer',"", ""'person',"", ""'adventurous',"", ""'quite',"", ""'people',"", ""'experience',"", ""'thai',"", ""'culture',"", ""'thailand',"", ""'experience',"", ""'thai',"", ""'culture',"", ""'town',"", ""'cater',"", ""'tourists',"", ""'real',"", ""'thai',"", ""'culture',"", ""'buy',"", ""'meal',"", ""'7',"", ""'11',"", ""'sit',"", ""'play',"", ""'cell',"", ""'phone',"", ""'3',"", ""'hours',"", ""'people',"", ""'try',"", ""'lot',"", ""'different',"", ""'thai',"", ""'food',"", ""'good',"", ""'start',"", ""'friendly',"", ""'thais',"", ""'meet',"", ""'way',"", ""'small',"", ""'conversations',"", ""'wary',"", ""'ones',"", ""'friendly',"", ""'may',"", ""'ulterior',"", ""'motives',"", ""'suggestion',"", ""'personally',"", ""'fan',"", ""'hua',"", ""'hin',"", ""'beach',"", ""'awful',"", ""'phuket',"", ""'krabi',"", ""'area',"", ""'samui',"", ""'good',"", ""'start',"", ""'place',"", ""'one',"", ""'time',"", ""'different',"", ""'weather',"", ""'pattern']""]",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

we heard railay beach krabi supposed nicest krabi, indeed rayavadee hotel looks nice, little budget, provisional hotel krabi, ritz carlton, looks good though. looked cut koh tao add day two given seems lot activities area (boat tours, hiking, nightlife etc).

thanks very much for all your most helpful responses, it is very much appreciated.
on the cv19 situation and the travel agent, while we would never ordinarily book via a travel agent given the pandemic there is far greater security with booking through our agent as if there are quarantine requirements or government advice not to travel to thailand then our travel agent will refund or reschedule our trip.
we appreciate that there is a lot of moving about, though we really do get bored from being in one area for more than 6-7 days. if we are to remove a destination it would probably be koh tao given the poor reviews our hotel received, though we were really looking forward to the diving in koh tao, and the general vibe in the island. would anyone know if there would be good diving in other areas, we heard koh samui?
we heard that railay beach in krabi is supposed to be one of the nicest in krabi, and indeed the rayavadee hotel there looks very nice, though may be a little out of our budget, and our provisional hotel in krabi, the ritz carlton, looks good too though. if we looked to cut koh tao we would probably add a day or two here given that there seems to be a lot of activities in the area (boat tours, hiking, some nightlife etc).
koh lak was not in our original itinerary, but as we will be coming form koh sok np and flying from phuket logistically it makes sense. the similan islands looks like a great day trip too and the sarojin looks like a nice hotel to relax in before departing for dubai.
ko lanta was a place we were also considering but not sure if the beaches look as nice as our current destinations and its a bit out of the way.
once again any further thoughts on the above would be greatly appreciated.

the bigger popular beaches around phuket & krabi often have safety zones marked out with buoys, for swimming elsewhere, as long as you don't go too far out, it should be fine, but always keep a lookout, for longtail boats & jetskis, the dreadful loud noise they make should alert you to there presence long before they come close",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g293915-i3686-k13547328-Proposed_2022_trips-Thailand.html,Proposed 2022 trips,jaynewcastle11,Chesterfield,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jaynewcastle11?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,100,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,10000,"[""['travelling55',"", ""'see',"", ""'previous',"", ""'2',"", ""'thread',"", ""'sorry',"", ""'reply',"", ""'beach',"", ""'person',"", ""'swimmer',"", ""'sunbather',"", ""'walk',"", ""'lot',"", ""'sit',"", ""'beach',"", ""'bar',"", ""'afterwards',"", ""'solo',"", ""'traveller',"", ""'wary',"", ""'bag',"", ""'possessions',"", ""'unguarded',"", ""'beach',"", ""'ever',"", ""'pop',"", ""'water',"", ""'quick',"", ""'dip',"", ""'people',"", ""'bigger',"", ""'popular',"", ""'beach',"", ""'phuket',"", ""'krabi',"", ""'safety',"", ""'zone',"", ""'mark',"", ""'buoy',"", ""'swim',"", ""'elsewhere',"", ""'long',"", ""'far',"", ""'fine',"", ""'keep',"", ""'lookout',"", ""'longtail',"", ""'boat',"", ""'jetskis',"", ""'dreadful',"", ""'loud',"", ""'noise',"", ""'alert',"", ""'presence',"", ""'long',"", ""'close']""]",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

well it’s for her 40th birthday so i wanted to surprise her with various gifts and i wanted to send a birthday card anyway.
as for jewellery yes i guess i could try an indonesian store! i was surprised swarovski don’t have an indonesian website, yet there’s a malaysia, singapore, china, japan, korea store etc.
anyway, she told me that twinings tins of tea were expensive in indonesia and i got a really good deal for a 200g tin of twinings green tea, earl grey tea and breakfast tea, then she likes camomile so i bought a really nice tin for her on amazon. about the perfume actually, i’ve already got it. as for the moisturiser there’s a particular brand that i think is completely unavailable in indonesia that my mum always uses and she’d mentioned that she would like to try it one day.
it’s just that i really wanted to surprise her for her birthday with several gifts to show my affection.
surfing wild maybe i’m naive but why don’t they simply send it to your address directly and ask for the tax?
>>> i believe customs charges include the cost of the shipping or postage as well.
mangomunky i’m a bit confused what you mean by including the postage. i’ll be paying the postage to jakarta. maybe i misunderstood something.
so essentially if i put £50 value on the package, she could in theory have to pay 50% of this amount?? £3 seems incredibly low! so for her not to pay anything the total value would have to be minimal?? or marked as a gift?? i wonder would it be a bad idea to mark as a gift if total value is £70.
thanks a lot
