must eat at some of the restaurants on park street- peter cat (chelo kebab), mocambo (continental), bar b q (indian and chinese) and one step up (indian/conti). for a bit more authentic chinese, take a trip to tangra area- beijing, kafulok, golden joy.

for a short stay, i would normally suggest the szr from world trade centre to business bay as its about as central as it gets but i think for your age range, the jumeirah cluster of hotels close to mall of the emirates might be the best fit all round (disney style 'souk', waterpark, lots of restaurants, bars and its own beach too).
al maha in the desert is wonderful but they don't allow children (i am pretty sure) but bab al shams do - nice pool and they have mini golf and other kids activities. there are other desert resorts outside of dubai in rak and ad but they are quite long drives (qasr al sarab is set in wonderful dunes and is quite breathtaking) which might mean they are off the table.
shout if you need recommendations for desert (a nice private bbq away from the crowds would be my suggestion) and maybe a private city tour? used to organise events in the city so still have a few contacts that can help out. you'll have a blast!",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g295424-i872-k13523452-Itinerary_thoughts_suggestions-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html,Itinerary thoughts & suggestions,Sean R,UK,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/275seanr?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,50,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,50,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,50,0,0,0,0,0.0,50,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,50,0,0,200,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,200,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,50,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,55000,"[""['spec',"", ""'see',"", ""'past',"", ""'madinat',"", ""'dubai',"", ""'stay',"", ""'middle',"", ""'east',"", ""'short',"", ""'stay',"", ""'normally',"", ""'szr',"", ""'world',"", ""'trade',"", ""'centre',"", ""'business',"", ""'bay',"", ""'central',"", ""'age',"", ""'range',"", ""'jumeirah',"", ""'cluster',"", ""'hotels',"", ""'close',"", ""'mall',"", ""'emirates',"", ""'fit',"", ""'round',"", ""'disney',"", ""'style',"", ""'souk',"", ""'waterpark',"", ""'lot',"", ""'restaurants',"", ""'bar',"", ""'beach',"", ""'al',"", ""'maha',"", ""'desert',"", ""'wonderful',"", ""'allow',"", ""'children',"", ""'pretty',"", ""'bab',"", ""'al',"", ""'sham',"", ""'pool',"", ""'mini',"", ""'golf',"", ""'kid',"", ""'activities',"", ""'desert',"", ""'resort',"", ""'outside',"", ""'dubai',"", ""'rak',"", ""'ad',"", ""'quite',"", ""'long',"", ""'drive',"", ""'qasr',"", ""'al',"", ""'sarab',"", ""'set',"", ""'wonderful',"", ""'dun',"", ""'quite',"", ""'breathtaking',"", ""'table',"", ""'shout',"", ""'recommendations',"", ""'desert',"", ""'private',"", ""'bbq',"", ""'away',"", ""'crowd',"", ""'suggestion',"", ""'private',"", ""'city',"", ""'tour',"", ""'organise',"", ""'events',"", ""'city',"", ""'contact',"", ""'help',"", ""'blast']""]",False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,True,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

cheers folks..","hi
most of our stays at the beach were in the ground floor rooms, with their own terrace overlooking the palmito lawn... the corridor to them is near the ground floor exit heading to the beach after you come down the spiral staircase with the gold coloured handrail from reception ..room numbers beginning with the number 9.. nice little terrace with “ rock & swivel” ( very 1970’s ) chairs, a small table and a big sun umbrella.. these rooms are a bit bigger than standard rooms in the main block.
the 7th floor, which used to be the mushref bar is now the italian restaurant called “ sette”... it has its own listing on ta..although it wasn’t yet open the last time we were there.
the old italian, traviata, , was briefly converted into an arab/asian restaurant called “ phoenicia”, and we ate there a couple of times..... it was absolutely average... not impressed.. it’s listed as “ closed “ on ta.
one thing we really noticed on our last visit was that so many of the staff, who had become friends over the years were no longer there...miriam, who worked in the mushref bar, sunil, who ran the mushref bar, faith, who was the face of the peacock lounge for years, and who then moved on promotion to shooters, and was very successful there for her friendly approach and dedication to guest satisfaction, and sophia, who was a “ trainee “ in the ibn majid buffet restaurant when we first met her..
all those people were a huge asset to the hotel... we are fb friends with all of them, and several more, and all got the push when ja wanted to try and freshen up their style/customer facing profile when they tarted up the beach hotel.
what they did was sack a lot of their ( shall i say, “ more mature” ) staff and bring in a lot of new recruits who weren’t properly trained...
when i ask for a g&t in a bar, i don’t expect to be given a warm shot ( ?) glass, straight out of the glass washing machine, with a jug containing flat tonic water, and a saucer with 3 ice cubes and a slice of lemon..
i can do that at home...
in fact , it’s friday curry night, chez nous , so i’m heading to the fridge for some ice from dispenser, a wedge of lime, a can of fever tree cucumber, and a decent slug of bombay sapphire...

i have stayed in dolphin for 3 nights a couple of years back. rooms were large, beds comfortable, working ac, 24 hour hot water, flat screen tvs etc. it was clean, but not spic and span - but nothing intolerable. remember most resorts are staffed by islanders and you may find the same 'relaxed' service / cleanliness!
biggest positive is it is right on the beach and there are beach facing cottages that have direct sea view. unless you are planning to spend a lot of time indoors (which is highly unlikely - given the number of things to do in havelock). the restaurant / dining hall was clean and the menu was simple - mostly vegetarian, but non-veg available on order. food was alright.
location is awesome and has plenty of open spaces, benches, hammocks etc.to laze around. ideal for sun rise view in the morning. booking it is a hassle, but online booking is available for some of the rooms. if you are a value conscious traveler, go for it!",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g297583-i9941-k13497536-Best_3_beach_resorts_with_sandy_beach_in_Havelock-Andaman_and_Nicobar_Islands.html,Best 3 beach resorts with sandy beach in Havelock,ravi_vee,Galaxy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ravi_vee?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,50,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,50,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,200,0.0,0,0,0.0,50.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,50,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,30000,"[""['pankaj',"", ""'stay',"", ""'dolphin',"", ""'3',"", ""'nights',"", ""'couple',"", ""'room',"", ""'large',"", ""'bed',"", ""'comfortable',"", ""'work',"", ""'ac',"", ""'24',"", ""'hour',"", ""'hot',"", ""'water',"", ""'flat',"", ""'screen',"", ""'tvs',"", ""'clean',"", ""'spic',"", ""'span',"", ""'intolerable',"", ""'resort',"", ""'staff',"", ""'islanders',"", ""'may',"", ""'relax',"", ""'service',"", ""'cleanliness',"", ""'biggest',"", ""'positive',"", ""'right',"", ""'beach',"", ""'beach',"", ""'face',"", ""'cottages',"", ""'direct',"", ""'sea',"", ""'view',"", ""'plan',"", ""'spend',"", ""'lot',"", ""'time',"", ""'indoors',"", ""'highly',"", ""'unlikely',"", ""'number',"", ""'havelock',"", ""'restaurant',"", ""'din',"", ""'hall',"", ""'clean',"", ""'menu',"", ""'simple',"", ""'mostly',"", ""'vegetarian',"", ""'non',"", ""'veg',"", ""'order',"", ""'food',"", ""'location',"", ""'awesome',"", ""'plenty',"", ""'open',"", ""'space',"", ""'bench',"", ""'hammocks',"", ""'etcto',"", ""'laze',"", ""'ideal',"", ""'sun',"", ""'rise',"", ""'view',"", ""'morning',"", ""'book',"", ""'hassle',"", ""'online',"", ""'book',"", ""'room',"", ""'value',"", ""'conscious',"", ""'traveler']""]",False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

don't worry about the post which disappeared, they mostly come back after a few hours.
i know both restaurants, the hacienda and french market but i never tried them roasted chicken.
what i can tell is that there is big difference between this 2 places. one is french ( from french kiss divers) with of course a french atmosphere ( we like or hate it ) and the hacienda is more english and so more relax!
the hacienda has a huge place with mini-golf and cinema and petanque and it's a old institution of koh too. the frenmarket is about one year old and the location is next to the main road, more a place to be seen ( frenchies)",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g303910-i9415-k13525668-Unbelievable_100_bahts_covid_menu-Koh_Tao_Surat_Thani_Province.html,Unbelievable 100 bahts covid menu,Psyvolt,US,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Psyvolt?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,50,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,50,0,0,50,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,200,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,50,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,50.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,50,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,35000,"[""['welcome',"", ""'tripadvisor',"", ""'forum',"", ""'haverhill',"", ""'worry',"", ""'post',"", ""'disappear',"", ""'mostly',"", ""'hours',"", ""'restaurants',"", ""'hacienda',"", ""'french',"", ""'market',"", ""'try',"", ""'roast',"", ""'chicken',"", ""'tell',"", ""'big',"", ""'difference',"", ""'2',"", ""'place',"", ""'one',"", ""'french',"", ""'french',"", ""'kiss',"", ""'divers',"", ""'course',"", ""'french',"", ""'atmosphere',"", ""'hate',"", ""'hacienda',"", ""'english',"", ""'relax',"", ""'hacienda',"", ""'huge',"", ""'place',"", ""'mini',"", ""'golf',"", ""'cinema',"", ""'petanque',"", ""'old',"", ""'institution',"", ""'koh',"", ""'frenmarket',"", ""'one',"", ""'old',"", ""'location',"", ""'main',"", ""'road',"", ""'place',"", ""'see',"", ""'frenchies']""]",False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,True,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

tbh, takeaways/cafes in that part of town seem to change hands pretty regularly and last couple of times, i was not that impressed with the current crop - choice or quality. the pubs are fairly consistent though. most have outdoor areas as well but i can’t say about takeaway.
laila’s at the top of cockburn st, a short walk away was an exception though - a small, good lebanese place. we have eaten there several times now and have not been disappointed. i think they also did takeaway and there are several other decent places that way - although the popularity of cockburn st means they tend to the pricier end of the scale.
the other way, towards lothian road and around the usher hall was also an island of small/independent places of varying types. probably because of the student accommodation nearby. places like this are being priced out of central edinburgh though - leith or further down leith walk and out beyond the meadows is where they seem to be relocating to.

personally people trying to blame travelling to dubai for the current state of the uk covid rates is somewhat ridiculous and bizarre.
but, yes the palazzo versace is a great place. you really get that luxury vibe. afternoon tea was great, was in the main lobby area which is much more grand and luxurious than the executive club lounge. but, maybe because business is good right now they are moving it back to the club lounge from tomorrow. the club lounge drinks and food is from 6-8pm which is good. they had a decent f&b selection on offer. in fact the fox was gorgeous. an indian selection.

yes, motion sickness tablets help. don’t misunderstand me; saying buses trip. saying strongly want place accessible bus, it. end feeling quite ill (sometimes taking medication), obviously prefer avoid situation reasonably so, yes, there's good train option instead bus, opt train!
the train toyama takayama seems scenic, need work i'm happy visit shirakawa-go!
as tastes drinks, partner differ somewhat. japanese restaurants city several neighbouring city, 25 minutes away. so, yes, sure we'll opportunity try sake come japan little introduction help understand tastes...once restaurants reopen (all restaurants whole country currently closed due covid situation)! visit vineyard/ winery, i'm usually offered selection different wines taste, dry, sweet, medium bodied, full etc....will similar sake brewery tour tastings? need select brewery based tastes? sorry lack understanding subject!!

you mention curves going misaka tunnel; sorry, bus route relate to? i've googled i'm finding misaka tunnels misaka passes areas.
many thanks help input!","global715255 – in reply to #24, thank you for making a suggestion that offers an alternative to shirakawa-go. when i put ‘minkaen takayama' or ‘minkaen takayama suburbs’ in google, it just keeps bringing up shirakawa-go so i'm unfortunately unable to see what you’re suggesting. i do see hida folk village very close to takayama though, does this offer a good alternative to shirakawa-go?
yes, motion sickness tablets can help. please don’t misunderstand me; i am not saying i absolutely will not take buses on this trip. what i am saying is if i strongly want to get to a place that is only accessible by bus, then i will do it. but as i can end up feeling quite ill (sometimes even after taking medication), i obviously prefer to avoid that situation where i reasonably can so, yes, where there's a good train option instead of a bus, i will always opt for the train!
the train from toyama to takayama seems to be very scenic, i just need to work out if i'm happy to give up a visit to shirakawa-go!
as to our tastes in drinks, my partner and i differ somewhat. there are actually no japanese restaurants in our city but there are several in a neighbouring city, about 25 minutes away. so, yes, for sure we'll have the opportunity to try sake before we come to japan as a little introduction to help us understand our tastes...once the restaurants are reopen (all restaurants in our whole country are currently closed due to the covid situation)! but if i visit a vineyard/ winery, i'm usually offered a selection of different wines to taste, some dry, some sweet, some medium bodied, some full etc....will it be similar if we do a sake brewery tour with tastings? or do we need to select a brewery based on our tastes? sorry for my lack of understanding on this subject!!
in reply to #26 – yes, it will come as no surprise to you that i'm definitely favouring the fuji kaiyu to get to kawaguchi-ko!
you mention the curves going up misaka tunnel; sorry, which bus route does this relate to? i've googled it but i'm just finding misaka tunnels or misaka passes in other areas.
many thanks again for your help and input!",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g294232-i525-k13476354-Honshu_winter_itinerary_Japanese_Alps_questions-Japan.html,Honshu winter itinerary & Japanese Alps questions,Matilda_Bi,HK,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Matilda_Bi?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,100,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,400,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,100,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,225,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,66875,"[""['global715255',"", ""'reply',"", ""'24',"", ""'suggestion',"", ""'alternative',"", ""'shirakawa',"", ""'‘minkaen',"", ""'takayama',"", ""'‘minkaen',"", ""'takayama',"", ""'suburbs’',"", ""'google',"", ""'keep',"", ""'bring',"", ""'shirakawa',"", ""'unfortunately',"", ""'unable',"", ""'see',"", ""'you’re',"", ""'see',"", ""'hida',"", ""'folk',"", ""'village',"", ""'close',"", ""'takayama',"", ""'good',"", ""'alternative',"", ""'shirakawa',"", ""'motion',"", ""'sickness',"", ""'tablets',"", ""'help',"", ""'don’t',"", ""'misunderstand',"", ""'bus',"", ""'trip',"", ""'strongly',"", ""'place',"", ""'accessible',"", ""'bus',"", ""'end',"", ""'feel',"", ""'quite',"", ""'ill',"", ""'medication',"", ""'obviously',"", ""'prefer',"", ""'avoid',"", ""'situation',"", ""'reasonably',"", ""'good',"", ""'train',"", ""'instead',"", ""'bus',"", ""'opt',"", ""'train',"", ""'train',"", ""'toyama',"", ""'takayama',"", ""'scenic',"", ""'work',"", ""'happy',"", ""'visit',"", ""'shirakawa',"", ""'taste',"", ""'drink',"", ""'partner',"", ""'differ',"", ""'somewhat',"", ""'japanese',"", ""'restaurants',"", ""'city',"", ""'neighbour',"", ""'city',"", ""'25',"", ""'minutes',"", ""'away',"", ""'opportunity',"", ""'try',"", ""'sake',"", ""'japan',"", ""'little',"", ""'introduction',"", ""'help',"", ""'tastesonce',"", ""'restaurants',"", ""'reopen',"", ""'restaurants',"", ""'whole',"", ""'country',"", ""'close',"", ""'due',"", ""'covid',"", ""'situation',"", ""'visit',"", ""'vineyard',"", ""'winery',"", ""'selection',"", ""'different',"", ""'win',"", ""'taste',"", ""'dry',"", ""'sweet',"", ""'medium',"", ""'body',"", ""'full',"", ""'etcwill',"", ""'similar',"", ""'sake',"", ""'brewery',"", ""'tour',"", ""'taste',"", ""'select',"", ""'brewery',"", ""'base',"", ""'taste',"", ""'sorry',"", ""'lack',"", ""'subject',"", ""'reply',"", ""'26',"", ""'surprise',"", ""'favour',"", ""'fuji',"", ""'kaiyu',"", ""'kawaguchi',"", ""'ko',"", ""'curve',"", ""'misaka',"", ""'tunnel',"", ""'sorry',"", ""'bus',"", ""'route',"", ""'relate',"", ""'google',"", ""'misaka',"", ""'tunnel',"", ""'misaka',"", ""'pass',"", ""'areas',"", ""'many',"", ""'help',"", ""'input']""]",False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

sanur has a lovely beachfront pathway with cafes, restaurants, markets. the main road, jalan danau tamblingan, has cafes, restaurants, bakeries, supermarket, shops. cycling is popular in sanur. beach is child friendly. you might enjoy a prahu boat ride. approximately half an hour to airport.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g294226-i7220-k13599665-2022_back_to_the_drawing_board-Bali.html,2022 - back to the drawing board,baliAustralia,AU,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/baliAustralia?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,100,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,100,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,100,0,400,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,100,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,60000,"[""['hundreds',"", ""'travellers',"", ""'depart',"", ""'ubud',"", ""'ngurah',"", ""'rai',"", ""'airport',"", ""'keep',"", ""'mind',"", ""'time',"", ""'ubud',"", ""'accommodation',"", ""'flight',"", ""'departure',"", ""'time',"", ""'you’ll',"", ""'distance',"", ""'ubud',"", ""'arrival',"", ""'bali',"", ""'you’ve',"", ""'6',"", ""'nights',"", ""'ubud',"", ""'there’s',"", ""'time',"", ""'cook',"", ""'class',"", ""'shop',"", ""'ubud',"", ""'brilliant',"", ""'children',"", ""'may',"", ""'pondok',"", ""'pekak',"", ""'library',"", ""'learn',"", ""'centre',"", ""'ubud',"", ""'activities',"", ""'eg',"", ""'balinese',"", ""'dance',"", ""'gamelan',"", ""'wood',"", ""'carve',"", ""'fruit',"", ""'carve',"", ""'balinese',"", ""'silver',"", ""'jewellery',"", ""'balinese',"", ""'modern',"", ""'paint',"", ""'you’re',"", ""'move',"", ""'lot',"", ""'unpack',"", ""'pack',"", ""'travel',"", ""'you’ll',"", ""'lose',"", ""'time',"", ""'transfer',"", ""'travel',"", ""'suitcases',"", ""'main',"", ""'luggage',"", ""'ubud',"", ""'accommodation',"", ""'hand',"", ""'luggage',"", ""'island',"", ""'trip',"", ""'sanur',"", ""'leg',"", ""'cook',"", ""'class',"", ""'cook',"", ""'class',"", ""'janet',"", ""'de',"", ""'neefe',"", ""'casa',"", ""'luna',"", ""'indus',"", ""'fame',"", ""'ubud',"", ""'excellent',"", ""'sanur',"", ""'beachfront',"", ""'pathway',"", ""'cafes',"", ""'restaurants',"", ""'market',"", ""'main',"", ""'road',"", ""'jalan',"", ""'danau',"", ""'tamblingan',"", ""'cafes',"", ""'restaurants',"", ""'bakeries',"", ""'supermarket',"", ""'shop',"", ""'cycle',"", ""'popular',"", ""'sanur',"", ""'beach',"", ""'child',"", ""'friendly',"", ""'prahu',"", ""'boat',"", ""'ride',"", ""'approximately',"", ""'half',"", ""'hour',"", ""'airport']""]",False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

","the sudemala resort is on seraya island which is 45 - 60 minutes from labuan bajo by boat.
labuan bajo is not the most attractive town on flores. within 15 years the once small fishing village has become a kuta-like place with a lot of facilities especially for tourists. the small town is full with hotels, restaurants (for some reason many italian restaurants), agents and projects. no nice beaches within the town itself (the most attractive ones are around 6 kms north of town). you could visit batu cermin, a cave in the northern part of town. at night there is a pasar kuliner (a foodmarket starting around 5 pm).
for a daytrip on the mainland of flores you’d better visit cunca wulang or cunca rami (waterfall) or lake sano nggoang or ruteng. even better a multiday overland trip.
the last time i was there was last year in april the town was empty, most restaurants and shops were closed.
regarding the tricky covid-situation in indonesia and the ever-changing reports about reopening, travelbubbles etc (and none of them came true untill now) we don’t know when everything will be back to normal again.
see also this article which means it will be very doubtful you can travel to flores in september.

ramen is everywhere. most places do a decent enough job. the ones that get very high marks often see long lines--not necessarily worth the effort.
sushi: i agree toyosu is not worth it at all. tsukiji outer market has sushi restaurants as well as other small eats. it's a much more interesting place to wander for 1/2 day. during normal times, it becomes very crowded after 10am so go early if you can. on average, i do find that even the chains around tsukiji serve slightly better quality items than some other places. of course, you can look at reviews and book some of the famous places at other parts of tokyo where quality and the whole experience could be better.
tokyo, osaka and other large cities also have very good places for yakiniku (grilled meat). be sure to try it a couple of times. you don't necessarily have to go for the top wagyu to enjoy the experience.
finally, december is iffy at best to visit at this point. a lot depends on the japanese vaccination rate by then but also whether japan feels foreign country visitors would bring in more cases. don't commit to anything if you can't get a refund.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g294232-i525-k13556687-Researching_for_December_2021_trip-Japan.html,Researching for December 2021 trip,SammyFD,HK,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SammyFD?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,50,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,50,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,50,0,0,200,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,200,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,50,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,50,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,50,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,55000,"[""['fly',"", ""'tokyo',"", ""'order',"", ""'visit',"", ""'face',"", ""'many',"", ""'long',"", ""'train',"", ""'bus',"", ""'rid',"", ""'long',"", ""'flight',"", ""'spend',"", ""'initial',"", ""'days',"", ""'tokyo',"", ""'work',"", ""'way',"", ""'kansai',"", ""'end',"", ""'trip',"", ""'fly',"", ""'osaka',"", ""'home',"", ""'via',"", ""'tokyo',"", ""'airport',"", ""'transit',"", ""'necessary',"", ""'ramen',"", ""'everywhere',"", ""'place',"", ""'decent',"", ""'job',"", ""'ones',"", ""'high',"", ""'mark',"", ""'see',"", ""'long',"", ""'line',"", ""'necessarily',"", ""'worth',"", ""'effort',"", ""'sushi',"", ""'toyosu',"", ""'worth',"", ""'tsukiji',"", ""'outer',"", ""'market',"", ""'sushi',"", ""'restaurants',"", ""'small',"", ""'eat',"", ""'much',"", ""'interest',"", ""'place',"", ""'wander',"", ""'1',"", ""'2',"", ""'day',"", ""'normal',"", ""'time',"", ""'become',"", ""'crowd',"", ""'10am',"", ""'early',"", ""'average',"", ""'chain',"", ""'tsukiji',"", ""'serve',"", ""'slightly',"", ""'quality',"", ""'items',"", ""'place',"", ""'course',"", ""'book',"", ""'famous',"", ""'place',"", ""'part',"", ""'tokyo',"", ""'quality',"", ""'whole',"", ""'experience',"", ""'tokyo',"", ""'osaka',"", ""'large',"", ""'cities',"", ""'good',"", ""'place',"", ""'yakiniku',"", ""'grill',"", ""'meat',"", ""'try',"", ""'couple',"", ""'time',"", ""'necessarily',"", ""'top',"", ""'wagyu',"", ""'experience',"", ""'finally',"", ""'december',"", ""'iffy',"", ""'visit',"", ""'point',"", ""'lot',"", ""'japanese',"", ""'vaccination',"", ""'rate',"", ""'whether',"", ""'japan',"", ""'feel',"", ""'foreign',"", ""'country',"", ""'visitors',"", ""'bring',"", ""'case',"", ""'commit',"", ""'refund']""]",False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,True,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

i planning spend time bangkok purpose.i twice don’t need overnights flights.
i add days something must do, close adding much travel time
i loved koh samui read november best time travel there.
i look forward suggestions you. favourite part , planning all. excited.
thank advance expertise experiences.","hello everyone.
sorry this is so long.
i am planning a trip to thailand for the month of november 2022, (surely we will be good to go by then right?). i am so excited just thinking about travelling i want to ask your opinion on my plan.
i am 67 and my husband 72. i have been in various countries in south east asia, and in thailand 3 times. my husband has never been.
so this is the plan so far (open to critique, comments and suggestions)
i will have been in bali for the month of october with a friend and then flying to bangkok to meet up with hubby. overnight at the airport hotel
fly to siem reap for four nights. i have been , husband and friend have not. see the temples, ton le sap lake at sunset and a dance show. anyone recommend a good show?
looking for a mid range hotel with a pool walking distance to the market etc if you have a favourite.
from there fly to chaing mai for six nights . again i have been, others have not. we want to go to an elephant sanctuary (any recommendations?) a cooking class and sightsee lots of temples.
perhaps a trip up to chaing rai, (is it worth it? haven’t been) perhaps add another day to overnight there?
the yee peng lantern festival will be happening so thinking of going to the university for the first night to see it, and looking for recommendations for a roof top restaurant /bar for the second night.
any hints on chaing mai would be appreciated. i will want to stay in the old city.
i will also get another thai silk jacket made if i can. i had one made there 15 years ago and it was amazing. i lost too much weight to wear it any more. which is good and bad. anyone recommend a good reasonable tailor who has actual thai silk . i had one made in vietnam a couple years ago but it was a silk polyester blend i think and not the same.
my friend will go home at this point and husband and i will maybe head to khao sok for four nights, thinking of jungle house.
is that too much time, not enough? i read of another place where the cabins are on the water and you can kayak right off them but cant find that. any one know what it is called?
would i want to stay a couple of nights at each place?
will it be really hot, muggy and buggy there in november? my husband does not do well with extreme mugginess and heat.
then the beach!! phi phi for 8 nights to relax, read, swim and snorkel. i stayed at phi phi relax last time, this time though i think i will stay in one of their beachfront cabins so as to avoid all of those stairs.
or open to any other recommendations of similar places. we like to walk out the door and swim in the ocean.
then railay beach for 5 nights . i cant believe how much the prices have gone up since i was there 4 years ago! thinking of railay village resort but open to suggestions. last time we stayed at sand sea but the price has gone up so much.
i am not planning to spend any time in bangkok on purpose.i have been twice before and don’t need to go back other than overnights for flights.
i can add a few more days if you think there is something else that is a must do, close to where we will be so not adding too much travel time
i loved koh samui but from what i have read november is not the best time to travel there.
i look forward to any suggestions from you. this is my favourite part , the planning of it all. i am so excited.

back in 2018, my wife and i spent four days enjoying oxford and the surroundings.
your plans sound good for the time allowed. excellent you have scheduled a visit to blenheim palace.
we ate in the summertown area just about every day. we liked ""mama mia"", and ""joe's bar and grill"". we found the ""dancing dragon"" too noisy and mediocre. we also had a bad experience eating at ""mac donald bear"" at woodstock near blenheim palace (review below).
in general, oxford was a good experience for us, with only one disappointment as far as the attractions over there. my review of it is included here. hopefully, your visit will be better than mine.
our visit/tour to the library was great. too bad we were not allowed to take photos of the interior. if you visit moreton et marsh, perhaps you should also include a cotswold tour. we highly recommend ""the secret cottage"" tour operator (see review below). this i must add, was a pleasant surprise, normally, we find these sort of tours very rushed and not pleasant at all.
i will be glad to help with any questions you may have.

i no longer live in london, but am lucky to live in a lovely town only 20 miles to the south...although being honest, at times my town is a bit too ""lovely"" for my liking and i find myself craving trips up to town. i'm lucky that we have reasonable train links into london, so since things have been opening up again i've made a point of setting saturdays aside so that i can jump on a train and go and explore familiar and some not so familiar sights. back in the noughties i spent a little over a year working in canary wharf, and i have to say that i wasn't a fan, to me is was a soulless concrete jungle (possibly not helped by not enjoying the job i was doing there!). but last saturday i decided to go and see if anything had changed, and was pleasantly surprised! for a saturday, the place was buzzing. people were out enjoying the bars, restaurants and malls, and generally strolling around in what was the start of a week-long heatwave. i particularly enjoyed watching the hot tub and bbq boats, a fairly new attraction where you and a group of friends hire a boat and either cook your own food on an onboard grill, or float around the docks in your own private hot tub (note that i am in no way affiliated with the company that provides this service, i just enjoyed seeing them!).

the cathedral exceptional durham, pouring rain, charming. well worth hours hours train.
thank you, durham, preserving amazing unesco world heritage site welcoming people graciously kindly. graciousness kindness remember. lasagna. :)","i went to durham to see the cathedral on tuesday, july 6, and i wanted to share my experience with other would-be travelers.
-book the guided tour in advance. it was sold out for the day i went, and i had been waiting many years to visit the cathedral (romanesque architecture is my absolute favorite). it did not even occur to me that i needed to book many days in advance. i honestly thought i would cry when they kindly said it was sold out*. i texted my children and husband; my husband offered to try to find me a private tour guide immediately, but there was not way that could have worked out. very sweet of him, though.
-tour groups are currently limited to 5 or 6 ppl total. i was confused bc there was at least 1 large school group there on that day; many more than 5-6 ppl. i realize the rules come from the uk govt, not the cathedral. i realize that the cathedral is doing its best to follow what seem to be confusing rules (a big school group = ok, +6 adults in a tour group = not ok). it is what it is--just know them before you go.
-reserve a table in the cafe if you think you might eat there, or eat after 2pm.
*i did not cry, although i may never get to go to durham again (i live in tx), because of the volunteers at the cathedral. i would especially like to highlight hazel, a docent who was so helpful. she was like an angel. she answered my many questions in great detail and was the best of the british--kind, knowledgeable, and with a reserve that comes from a deep well of very good manners. she made me feel i could ask as many questions as i wanted to.
another female docent, tall, thin, with a sporty short haircut, encouraged me to buy a guidebook (which i did) and it was so helpful. many thanks to her.
it was a miserable day--chilly and pouring rain. a chipper younger woman at the entrance pointed out the river path to the bridge, and i'm so glad she did; it was a wonderful (although chilly) walk.
i arrived on a train from london; there is a bus that runs you to the cathedral every 15 minutes or so. many thanks to the women working in the station that day who pointed me in the right direction to catch the bus.
the bus driver was so nice and friendly. such an asset to durham and i'm sorry i did not make note of his name.
i had not eaten all day and, after seeing most of the cathedral, i went down to the cafe on a chance; there was 1 unreserved table at 2:15 (the guided tour started at 2). the women working in the cafe were very helpful. i had the lasagna special (lasagna, bread, and a salad) and a giant (hot and cozy) latte. my lunch was delicious and perfect for the weather.
there was a young, young woman in the gift shop; she was precious and sweet. the shop has a very good book on the architecture of the cathedral which i have been reading.
i wandered around the immediate area before catching the bus back to the train station and back to london. 6 hours on a train; 3 hours in durham.
all of the people i have referenced were at their posts after 12:20 on july 6. they deserve recognition. if there is any way to forward my thanks to them, please let me know.
the cathedral is exceptional and durham, even in the pouring rain, was charming. it was well worth the 3 hours there and 3 hours back on the train.

you’ll find you spend a lot of time watching the race on the big screens (or your ipad) as well as what’s in front of you so a decent view of a screen is important - silverstone is pancake flat so seeing across the circuit is near impossible). high up won’t achieve much more viewing and puts you i bit further from the action, the win is that if it’s raining you’ll be drier and if it’s blazing sun there’s some shade - i doubt it matters but i’d want to be a dozen rows back from the front to cover weather extremes.
a f1 race is a relatively long event and there’s no natural ‘half time’ so from drivers parade to the end will take its toll on the bladders of the folk who go to the race with a few (or a lot of) beers (and there will be quite a few of them). if you sit at the end of a row you’ll be jumping up to let them visit the facilities with monotonous regularity, if you sit in the middle it will be a struggle if you get the call of nature. your choice!
ot, but if you want to watch a motor race rather than just ‘be there’ brands hatch offers a better viewing experience.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g504028-i19734-k13520099-British_F1_2021_first_time_tickets_in_Becketts_vs_Luffied-Silverstone_Northamptonshire_En.html,British F1 2021 first time - tickets in Becketts vs Luffied,Mark E,US,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mark_Elliott?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,100,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,100,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,100,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,100,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,100.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,100,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,60000,"[""['i’ve',"", ""'luffield',"", ""'can’t',"", ""'help',"", ""'you’ll',"", ""'spend',"", ""'lot',"", ""'time',"", ""'watch',"", ""'race',"", ""'big',"", ""'screen',"", ""'ipad',"", ""'what’s',"", ""'front',"", ""'decent',"", ""'view',"", ""'screen',"", ""'important',"", ""'silverstone',"", ""'pancake',"", ""'flat',"", ""'see',"", ""'circuit',"", ""'near',"", ""'impossible',"", ""'high',"", ""'won’t',"", ""'achieve',"", ""'much',"", ""'view',"", ""'action',"", ""'win',"", ""'it’s',"", ""'rain',"", ""'you’ll',"", ""'drier',"", ""'it’s',"", ""'blaze',"", ""'sun',"", ""'there’s',"", ""'shade',"", ""'doubt',"", ""'matter',"", ""'i’d',"", ""'dozen',"", ""'row',"", ""'front',"", ""'cover',"", ""'weather',"", ""'extremes',"", ""'f1',"", ""'race',"", ""'relatively',"", ""'long',"", ""'event',"", ""'there’s',"", ""'natural',"", ""'‘half',"", ""'time’',"", ""'drivers',"", ""'parade',"", ""'end',"", ""'toll',"", ""'bladders',"", ""'folk',"", ""'race',"", ""'lot',"", ""'beers',"", ""'quite',"", ""'sit',"", ""'end',"", ""'row',"", ""'you’ll',"", ""'jump',"", ""'visit',"", ""'facilities',"", ""'monotonous',"", ""'regularity',"", ""'sit',"", ""'middle',"", ""'struggle',"", ""'call',"", ""'nature',"", ""'choice',"", ""'ot',"", ""'watch',"", ""'motor',"", ""'race',"", ""'‘be',"", ""'there’',"", ""'brand',"", ""'hatch',"", ""'view',"", ""'experience']""]",False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,True,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

first for me is new zealand with the bubble arrangement leaving this weekend and will work remote for 3 weeks.
2022 - depending on restrictions my partner wants to go to bali. not my favourite place as i love great beaches, but she has never been and we were hoping to stay at a series of pool villas to see different areas. if indonesia is shut then it will be back to thailand or vietnam, perhaps both. if none of those are available then into the pacific - fiji, samoa or cook island perhaps.
outside of that planning a return to london / europe but no dates in mind and as that will be a big trip could be some time off.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g293915-i3686-k13547328-Proposed_2022_trips-Thailand.html,Proposed 2022 trips,Iamsuperk,AU,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Iamsuperk?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,100.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,100,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,100,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,100,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,40000,"[""['sound',"", ""'jayne',"", ""'new',"", ""'zealand',"", ""'bubble',"", ""'arrangement',"", ""'weekend',"", ""'work',"", ""'remote',"", ""'3',"", ""'weeks',"", ""'2022',"", ""'restrictions',"", ""'partner',"", ""'bali',"", ""'favourite',"", ""'place',"", ""'beach',"", ""'hop',"", ""'stay',"", ""'series',"", ""'pool',"", ""'villas',"", ""'see',"", ""'different',"", ""'areas',"", ""'indonesia',"", ""'shut',"", ""'thailand',"", ""'vietnam',"", ""'none',"", ""'pacific',"", ""'fiji',"", ""'samoa',"", ""'cook',"", ""'island',"", ""'outside',"", ""'plan',"", ""'london',"", ""'europe',"", ""'date',"", ""'mind',"", ""'big',"", ""'trip',"", ""'time']""]",False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

anime is popular the world over, especially in tech heavy countries and singapore is no exception to that.

i think you are predominantly just seeing typical japanese exports and convergent evolution of activity. i mean its there but i wouldnt describe it as a fixation.

some background. i was born in singapore but haven't been back for a visit since 1989. need some advise as to where to stay.
looking for nice (not necessarily luxurious) accommodations. definitely a king bed, clean and most importantly, walkable to great local eats - specifically hawker food for me. that said, my husband is rather picky and unadventurous. hence, looking for burger joints, good italian, mexican or north american-style type restaurants. not looking for upscale - just a place to get a good meal with a cold beer on the days he's had enough of hawker food.
so the question is, where best to stay that will easily cater to our eating needs? also, looking to sightsee, so it should be convenient to transit.
thoughts? thanks in advance!",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g294265-i1748-k13510438-Best_area_to_stay_for_easy_access_to_yummy_food_and_transit-Singapore.html,Best area to stay for easy access to yummy food and transit,BajaR0sa,CA,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BajaR0sa?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,134,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,300,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,38978,"[""['book',"", ""'flight',"", ""'se',"", ""'asia',"", ""'early',"", ""'february',"", ""'22',"", ""'day',"", ""'trip',"", ""'much',"", ""'lock',"", ""'home',"", ""'fully',"", ""'normal',"", ""'soon',"", ""'background',"", ""'bear',"", ""'singapore',"", ""'visit',"", ""'1989',"", ""'stay',"", ""'necessarily',"", ""'luxurious',"", ""'accommodations',"", ""'king',"", ""'bed',"", ""'clean',"", ""'importantly',"", ""'walkable',"", ""'local',"", ""'eat',"", ""'specifically',"", ""'hawker',"", ""'food',"", ""'husband',"", ""'picky',"", ""'unadventurous',"", ""'hence',"", ""'burger',"", ""'joint',"", ""'good',"", ""'italian',"", ""'mexican',"", ""'north',"", ""'american',"", ""'style',"", ""'type',"", ""'restaurants',"", ""'upscale',"", ""'place',"", ""'good',"", ""'meal',"", ""'cold',"", ""'beer',"", ""'days',"", ""'hawker',"", ""'food',"", ""'question',"", ""'stay',"", ""'easily',"", ""'cater',"", ""'eat',"", ""'sightsee',"", ""'convenient',"", ""'transit',"", ""'thoughts',"", ""'advance']""]",False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

from this location you’ve got a station on your doorstep, buses all around you, chinatown 10 mins walk and the absolutely incredible la pau sat also 10 mins walk away. you can walk to boat quay in about 25 mins. there’s tonnes of eateries galore and you’re in the thick of the city of singapore.
the hotel itself has a knockout swimming pool and another one indoors with an italian restaurant called osso which i’ve been to and reviewed favourably on tripadvisor.
you can also walk to marina bay from this location in 30 mins.
there’s tanjong pagar road as well which is full of korean and japanese food eateries.

being stuck in the uk and uncertainty of when i was able to return due to flights being continuously cancelled, i had to change my check-in dates 11 times before i was able to return home and given this, my communication each time with mira moon was superb & seemless, with no questions asked or hassles and also accommodating pretty much all my requests.
the 3 weeks went relatively quickly as kept myself busy with exercise, and thankful for the large space of the full moon room, working and catching up with family and friends that helped pass the time. and not forgetting the free standing bath that was a welcoming luxury after the long runs i did in the room :) added to the experience, and were the standard amenities, were a nespresso machine (that led me to buy one as soon as i come out of quaranting!!) with ""free-flow"" capsules, small fridge (no freezer compartment), soaps and shampoo and ethernet connection & multiple usb ports.
having had to take full board as part of the quarantine package (which was all hotels), i can honestly say the food was excellent, with options of 'local touch', 'international' & 'vegetarian' where you could order from any type of cuisine in any one day, so the food was varied and tasty!
front desk service was always very curteous and prompt, including any outside deliveries from supermarket or care packages from friends around the world.
if i had to do it all again, i would more than likely stay at the mira moon again, though i don't plan to replicate the experiene any time soon!",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g294217-i1496-k13445935-List_of_Designated_Hotels_for_Quarantine-Hong_Kong.html,List of Designated Hotels for Quarantine,OneHellofaRide,US,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OneHellofaRide?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,50,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,50.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,50,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,50,0,0.0,0,0,0,50,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,50,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,50.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,200,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,37500,"[""['mira',"", ""'moon',"", ""'hotel',"", ""'wan',"", ""'chai',"", ""'excellent',"", ""'quarantine',"", ""'stay',"", ""'highly',"", ""'recommend',"", ""'stick',"", ""'uk',"", ""'uncertainty',"", ""'able',"", ""'due',"", ""'flight',"", ""'continuously',"", ""'cancel',"", ""'date',"", ""'11',"", ""'time',"", ""'able',"", ""'home',"", ""'communication',"", ""'time',"", ""'mira',"", ""'moon',"", ""'superb',"", ""'seemless',"", ""'question',"", ""'hassle',"", ""'accommodate',"", ""'pretty',"", ""'much',"", ""'request',"", ""'3',"", ""'weeks',"", ""'relatively',"", ""'quickly',"", ""'keep',"", ""'busy',"", ""'exercise',"", ""'thankful',"", ""'large',"", ""'space',"", ""'full',"", ""'moon',"", ""'room',"", ""'work',"", ""'catch',"", ""'family',"", ""'friends',"", ""'help',"", ""'pass',"", ""'time',"", ""'forget',"", ""'free',"", ""'stand',"", ""'bath',"", ""'welcome',"", ""'luxury',"", ""'long',"", ""'run',"", ""'room',"", ""'add',"", ""'experience',"", ""'standard',"", ""'amenities',"", ""'nespresso',"", ""'machine',"", ""'lead',"", ""'buy',"", ""'one',"", ""'soon',"", ""'quaranting',"", ""'free',"", ""'flow',"", ""'capsule',"", ""'small',"", ""'fridge',"", ""'freezer',"", ""'compartment',"", ""'soap',"", ""'shampoo',"", ""'ethernet',"", ""'connection',"", ""'multiple',"", ""'usb',"", ""'port',"", ""'full',"", ""'board',"", ""'part',"", ""'quarantine',"", ""'package',"", ""'hotels',"", ""'honestly',"", ""'food',"", ""'excellent',"", ""'options',"", ""'local',"", ""'touch',"", ""'international',"", ""'vegetarian',"", ""'order',"", ""'type',"", ""'cuisine',"", ""'one',"", ""'day',"", ""'food',"", ""'vary',"", ""'tasty',"", ""'front',"", ""'desk',"", ""'service',"", ""'curteous',"", ""'prompt',"", ""'include',"", ""'outside',"", ""'deliveries',"", ""'supermarket',"", ""'care',"", ""'package',"", ""'friends',"", ""'world',"", ""'stay',"", ""'mira',"", ""'moon',"", ""'plan',"", ""'replicate',"", ""'experiene',"", ""'time',"", ""'soon']""]",False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

i would suggest plan a night in lampang, too much to see and do for a daytrip. drive down visiting lamphun, perhaps mae tha market for sai ua (northern sausage) and kab moo plus nam prik (fried pork skin and chili dip), explore lampang city. next morning do wat chamloem and head back towards cm or continue on towards sukhothai,",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g293917-i9325-k13492135-Chiang_Mai_itinerary_and_Day_Trip_Questions-Chiang_Mai.html,Chiang Mai itinerary and Day-Trip Questions,MrCycling 🚵‍♂️,US,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrCycling?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,100,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,100,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,20000,"[""['people',"", ""'wat',"", ""'chaloem',"", ""'phra',"", ""'kiat',"", ""'prajomklao',"", ""'rachanusorn',"", ""'daytrip',"", ""'lampang',"", ""'hour',"", ""'north',"", ""'via',"", ""'118',"", ""'1252',"", ""'3',"", ""'3',"", ""'half',"", ""'hours',"", ""'wind',"", ""'mountain',"", ""'roads',"", ""'drive',"", ""'lampang',"", ""'wat',"", ""'2',"", ""'half',"", ""'hours',"", ""'stairs',"", ""'long',"", ""'top',"", ""'spectacular',"", ""'view',"", ""'reason',"", ""'plan',"", ""'night',"", ""'lampang',"", ""'much',"", ""'see',"", ""'daytrip',"", ""'drive',"", ""'visit',"", ""'lamphun',"", ""'mae',"", ""'tha',"", ""'market',"", ""'sai',"", ""'ua',"", ""'northern',"", ""'sausage',"", ""'kab',"", ""'moo',"", ""'plus',"", ""'nam',"", ""'prik',"", ""'fry',"", ""'pork',"", ""'skin',"", ""'chili',"", ""'dip',"", ""'explore',"", ""'lampang',"", ""'city',"", ""'morning',"", ""'wat',"", ""'chamloem',"", ""'head',"", ""'cm',"", ""'continue',"", ""'sukhothai']""]",False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

hoping to spend 3.5 weeks in thailand with my partner and 2 kids (6&8) in march/april 2022. i've visited a couple of times before but never with kids. want to keep travel time to a minimum and avoid long distances by road as the younger lad gets car sick esp in the heat. it's our first long haul trip.
would like a mix of affordable luxury accomm and budget options. we'd like to do some kid friendly sightseeing, shopping, nature and beaches- nothing too strenuous.
this is what i've planned so far and would be very grateful for any advice:
bangkok 4 nights centre point sukhumvit 10. sightseeing tour withlocals.com, snake farm and maybe siam park or similar in addition to some general wandering, eating, shopping etc.
sleeper to chiang mai (will book 1st class cabin in advance)
4-5 nights in cm, would love to stay at gaps house if family option available. elephant camp (day trip), night market, maybe cooking class.
fly to phuket and stay for approx 5 nights at centara grand karon
6 nights ko phi phi - phi phi the beach resort
back to phuket for the final week- katathani phuket beach resort. fly home from phuket.
i'm also interested in ko lanta but not sure how to fit in without a very long travel day and not a fan of packing up and moving too much with kids. re no of days my maths might be slightly off but you get the general idea :)

perhaps we will get to the uk in time, who knows.
i think perhaps the battersea dog and cat home might be a choice.
banks here are much less cosmopolitan than in the uk.
foreign currency or checks in other than dollar are a recipe for delay and frustration. before covid it would have been simple to go to a travelex currency exchange downtown. those have all closed. i don't know if any will reopen.
thanks again.

ok, so i wrote to some buddies of mine regarding jfk, i felt like i had survived a zombie apocolypse. the airport was pitiful. very few people, many eating places closed. it was truly sad. people were masking along w/ those who think masking includes just covering your mouth, not your nose!
my flight was uneventful. luckily i had a window seat and the two seat next to me open. there was a lot of open seats and some people were able to stretch out along four seats. the food was atrocious. one vegetarian offer and one chicken offer. i told the crew in the back how horrible the food was, even wrote corporate an email. i also said vegetarian is a selected option, not an offered option. they said too many people were vegetarian and missing the fact that they needed to request it so they simple offer it as one of two choices. i said, not my fault people can't read.
enjoyed dubai but be prepared for sticker shock. i like to travel to poland and food there is delicious, plentiful, fresh and cheap. i paid in dubai, mind you a nice mall cafe, $21usd for a desert and tea. a bottle of corona at the hotel was $14usd. i did venture out into the ethnic neighborhoods where you can eat inexpensively.
didn't mention it, but did go to the gardens (forgot the official name) and global village. enjoyed both. simple, stupid to get to. gardens are nice for two hours. global village , fun for shopping, i'd allot 4-5hrs.
el fahidi was my favorite place. its the restored old part of dubai with typical shops in it, but it does have a nice atmosphere. liked it more than the souks. in what i would consider the main entrance to el fahidi, off the circle entrance thru parking lot, just a couple yards from the arabian tea house, is a street that has a coffee cafe and a few shops. one of the shops the man sells book bags, mugs, water holders, matted pictures of your name in arabic script. this is, imho, the best shop because of its uniqueness. not made in prc. he actually does it free hand in different colors. they are beautiful and very very reasonable. i think a mug was $8usd, to me it is the best souvenir shop in all of dubai given that most of the pashimas, etc. are from india.

anyway, just thought i'd share these reports if useful.",0,0,0,0,US,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,100,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,100,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,100,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,30000,"[""['theoexpress',"", ""'sorry',"", ""'carlos',"", ""'recommendation',"", ""'tell',"", ""'jill',"", ""'yesterday',"", ""'close',"", ""'bum',"", ""'one',"", ""'time',"", ""'something',"", ""'quick',"", ""'trip',"", ""'macau',"", ""'future',"", ""'visit',"", ""'interest',"", ""'try',"", ""'local',"", ""'place',"", ""'street',"", ""'food',"", ""'speciality',"", ""'foods',"", ""'two',"", ""'diy',"", ""'food',"", ""'tour',"", ""'historic',"", ""'city',"", ""'centre',"", ""'penninsula',"", ""'taipa',"", ""'village',"", ""'future',"", ""'visit',"", ""'sister',"", ""'sar',"", ""'share',"", ""'report',"", ""'useful']""]",False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

i will go to dubai at the end of november. hope it is not too hot then. it will be first time, i think a week should be enough or even less?
task is now looking for a hotel. i would be thankful for suggestions. and here are my facts:
50 years old non-smoking male german solo traveler.
likes luxury hotels, however would want to stay below 250 usd / 200 eur per night. massive foodie, fantastic breakfast, maybe french style, should be included or at least available. a good hotel bar would be great to have at night. stylish, no drinking hall. i like noise isolation between neighbours and me. pool would be nice, but is no must. it is not necessary for me to socialize with other germans. near beach or at beach would be good but is no must.
since i do not yet know which sights i wanna see, i have no preference about hotel´s location yet. i guess it would be best if metro and taxis are in short walking distance to my hotel.
again, i am a massive foodie, always hungry for things like croissants with a lot of butter processed in them, top notch hot chocolates and meat foods from heaven.

i think i limit a lot of options being a 6 and 5 star that’s not a small mortgage .... hb i am keen on (at least b&b) because teenage children eat masses .... by my calculation i’m looking at a £50 per day per person spend for 2 courses my children unfortunately with me being a former chef are not the nuggets kids - they requested sushi at xmas after having it the year before at zabeel.
so really i need an excellent hb hotel and then can upgrade from there. fairmont are a 1/3 cheaper for their half board but reviews on the hb offering are terrible and i think i would find i would then need to dine out which of course would bring in the taxi cost and at that a larger vehicle each time. so would in turn bump up the price anyway.

they have a decent kitchen , whilst i don't cook on holiday i would make sandwiches and buy deli stuff to make it a bit more convenient and cheaper than expensive lunches etc. and use the fridge to store my duty free.

so what did you do in the day , did you go to other beach places to have pool time.
such a shame it came to that , ive been at christmas and never experienced that , even out of covid its been fine and not mad crazy , id look at perhaps different hotels next time , i personally i am always put off with the haboor as two many deals offered by some agents and being on the beach brings folk in but it always never really had good customer service . the worse place i ever saw at xmas was the mina al salam that was over run with kids and parents just plain drunk , and shouting at each other ,one woman in her best tucker flat out on the floor crying her heart out . that was some years ago but , it was just to much and i wouldnt stay there either at christmas as again to many people coming in from its various hotels on site
.we tend to stay at ghh and ive found that fine even with lrm pool and beach ive never felt descended on .
you clearly like the nice things in life , id recommend somewhere a bit smaller maybe in the city with a good pool deck for winter sunshine , maybe versace or something similar would suit better if you did want to go again at xmas.

i wanted to compare meal experiences at designated quarantine hotels for future trips back to hk for myself and friends and family.
i am staying at mira moon. they provide 3 choices for each day for each of the 3 meals of breakfast, lunch and dinner - local asian, international and vegetarian. the menu choices list for all 21 days of my stay was sent to me upon booking, and i was provided with a link for each day to make my meal selections. meals must be selected 5 days in advance and if i fail to select, the hotel would select for me. i had a very early morning arrival flight so i selected lunch and dinner for the first day. for the last day of the quarantine stay, only breakfast is provided.
dessert is provided with lunch and dinner, but no choice, just the daily dessert. to give you an idea of the experience so far:
day 1 lunch - stewed chicken in red wine sauce, garlic spaghetti, corn bread roll and mini croissant, steamed vegetables (carrots, broccoli, cauliflower), mini muffin with icing dessert. meal served in paper containers, cutlery is thin wood disposable. chicken a bit hard and solid, somewhat expected in bulk food preparation, garlic spaghetti really flavourful, good amount of vegetables, corn bread roll not much like corn bread and more like a roll with a slight corn taste, mini croissant good, hard to say what the mini muffin is as all i could taste was the sweet icing. the main rectangular tray container had 4 separate compartments to separate the different foods and keep everything looking nice and neat, and there were separate round containers for the bread and dessert. overall, large filling portion size, fairly healthy with good amount of vegetables, good taste and well presented. the disposable wood cutlery is difficult to use as they bend when pressed so the knife took a lot of effort to cut anything and the fork took multiple stabs to pick up pieces of chicken.
day 1 dinner - viennese fried pork filets with fries with ketchup and tartar sauce, cucumber salad with fish roe and salad sauce topping, bread roll and mini-croissant, dessert was some kind of custard cream topped with ground up peanuts topping. pork filet pieces were quite good, had some fat so not too lean and tough. fries were not oily. salad good. again, using disposable wood knife to cut the pork pieces was a real effort.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g294217-i1496-k13515511-Designated_quarantine_hotel_meals-Hong_Kong.html,Designated quarantine hotel

i fill whole month. hopefully, info enough plan. info leave comments fill contact form :)","i would probably fly into tokyo, spend a few days there and start moving to chubu (central region of japan's main island). i'd stop by nagano for few days to visit the monkey park, sightseeing around nagano station, and drop by matsumoto for the castle and the wasabi farm!
here's more info about the wasabi farm: 
on the way to the monkey park, i'll also stop by a town called obuse for its chestnut dessert and if you are interested in ukiyo-e art. 
then from matsumoto, i will use one of the discounted bus tickets to get to shirakawago, takayama, kamikochi, and then kanazawa. 
from kanazawa, i'd take a bullet train or high-speed bus to kyoto/osaka. i'd probably stay in osaka instead of kyoto cos the hotels in kyoto are usually more expensive. a couple of days in each city and i'd also extend my trip to cities close to osaka such as himeji and okayama.
himeji castle was ranked the best castle in japan so highly recommended. and don't forget to drop by its garden just next to it cos is beautiful. 
and if you have time, you can also visit mt. shosha in himeji that gives you a great view.

the best food in the county s mark birchall's 2 michelin star food at moor hall in aughton. absolutely wonderful food but the one time we were there i found the atmosphere a bit clinical and we prefer lisa goodwin-allen's 1 star cooking at northcote, which comes complete with a fabulous atmosphere, especially the wine evenings, which i greatly miss. i suspect that northcote is not far from a second star.
moor hall has the barn attached to it for a more relaxed and cheaper option, although still high quality cooking
tom parker at the white swan at fence is the other michelin starred place in the county and is different again - very relaxed dining in a former pub which sill looks and feels like a pub.
other places with high quality cooking are hipping hall near kirkby lonsdale, the inn at whitewell and the freemasons arms at wiswell. i hear great things of the parkers arms at newton-by-bowland but haven't been. finally 263 in central preston opened in 2019 and was a real star until the virus closed it and i hope it will survive.
at the cheaper more everyday level i enjoy fino tapas, the continental and tang in preston and san marco at much hoole. finally everyone should have a local go-to curry house and ours in the sangam in lostock hall. it couldn't be more different to moor hall but still excellent.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g187052-i235-k13456022-Favourite_restaurants_in_your_area-Greater_Manchester_England.html,Favourite restaurants in your area?,JohnEW2912,US,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JohnEW2912?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,300,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,30000,"[""['barry',"", ""'promise',"", ""'uk',"", ""'thread',"", ""'disappear',"", ""'one',"", ""'open',"", ""'lancashire',"", ""'recommendations',"", ""'none',"", ""'far',"", ""'manchester',"", ""'food',"", ""'county',"", ""'mark',"", ""'birchalls',"", ""'2',"", ""'michelin',"", ""'star',"", ""'food',"", ""'moor',"", ""'hall',"", ""'aughton',"", ""'wonderful',"", ""'food',"", ""'one',"", ""'time',"", ""'atmosphere',"", ""'clinical',"", ""'prefer',"", ""'lisa',"", ""'goodwin',"", ""'allens',"", ""'1',"", ""'star',"", ""'cook',"", ""'northcote',"", ""'complete',"", ""'fabulous',"", ""'atmosphere',"", ""'wine',"", ""'greatly',"", ""'miss',"", ""'suspect',"", ""'northcote',"", ""'far',"", ""'second',"", ""'star',"", ""'moor',"", ""'hall',"", ""'barn',"", ""'attach',"", ""'relax',"", ""'cheaper',"", ""'high',"", ""'quality',"", ""'cook',"", ""'tom',"", ""'parker',"", ""'white',"", ""'swan',"", ""'fence',"", ""'michelin',"", ""'star',"", ""'place',"", ""'county',"", ""'different',"", ""'relax',"", ""'din',"", ""'former',"", ""'pub',"", ""'sill',"", ""'feel',"", ""'pub',"", ""'place',"", ""'high',"", ""'quality',"", ""'cook',"", ""'hipping',"", ""'hall',"", ""'near',"", ""'kirkby',"", ""'lonsdale',"", ""'inn',"", ""'whitewell',"", ""'freemasons',"", ""'arm',"", ""'wiswell',"", ""'hear',"", ""'parkers',"", ""'arm',"", ""'newton',"", ""'bowland',"", ""'finally',"", ""'263',"", ""'central',"", ""'preston',"", ""'open',"", ""'2019',"", ""'real',"", ""'star',"", ""'virus',"", ""'close',"", ""'survive',"", ""'cheaper',"", ""'everyday',"", ""'level',"", ""'fino',"", ""'tapas',"", ""'continental',"", ""'tang',"", ""'preston',"", ""'san',"", ""'marco',"", ""'much',"", ""'hoole',"", ""'finally',"", ""'local',"", ""'curry',"", ""'house',"", ""'sangam',"", ""'lostock',"", ""'hall',"", ""'different',"", ""'moor',"", ""'hall',"", ""'excellent']""]",False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

if looking day trip tokyo, highly recommend geibikei gorge iwate boat trip gorge. boatman sign traditional song boat!
for info article: 
from osaka chubu area (shirakawago/takayama...etc), catch train bus kanazawa. spend least 1.5 days head shirakawago couple hours arriving takayama.
the article information discounted bus tickets chubu area. used mitsuboshi kaidou three-star route option ticket way.

from takayama, bus matsumoto nohi bus mitsuboshi kaidou three-star route option ticket well.
and matsumoto, recommend drop daio wasabi farm real wasabi!

and bullet train tokyo going jr pass matsumoto.
hope helps :)","i would suggest heading to hiroshima/miyajima soon after you arrive in tokyo (maybe allow for few days to recover from jetlag) just because the cherry blossom seasons should take place earlier in the south (albeit the difference is small).
if you are looking for another day trip out of tokyo, then i highly recommend the geibikei gorge in iwate for the boat trip down the gorge. your boatman will even sign the traditional song on the boat!
for info in this article: 
from osaka to chubu area (shirakawago/takayama...etc), i would catch a train or bus to kanazawa. spend at least 1.5 days there and head to shirakawago for a couple of hours and arriving at takayama.
the below article has information about discounted bus tickets for you to use in the chubu area. we used the mitsuboshi kaidou three-star route option ticket by the way.

from takayama, you can take the bus to matsumoto with nohi bus with the mitsuboshi kaidou three-star route option ticket as well.
and in matsumoto, recommend you to drop by the daio wasabi farm for some real wasabi!

and you can take a bullet train back to tokyo if you are going to get a jr pass from matsumoto.
hope the above helps :)",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g294232-i525-k13542015-4_weeks_in_March_2022_second_trip-Japan.html,4 weeks in March 2022 (second trip),Lilz,0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JapanTravelGuide?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,100,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,100,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,100,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,100,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,40000,"[""['head',"", ""'hiroshima',"", ""'miyajima',"", ""'soon',"", ""'arrive',"", ""'tokyo',"", ""'allow',"", ""'days',"", ""'recover',"", ""'jetlag',"", ""'cherry',"", ""'blossom',"", ""'season',"", ""'place',"", ""'earlier',"", ""'south',"", ""'albeit',"", ""'difference',"", ""'small',"", ""'day',"", ""'trip',"", ""'tokyo',"", ""'highly',"", ""'recommend',"", ""'geibikei',"", ""'gorge',"", ""'iwate',"", ""'boat',"", ""'trip',"", ""'gorge',"", ""'boatman',"", ""'sign',"", ""'traditional',"", ""'song',"", ""'boat',"", ""'info',"", ""'article',"", ""'osaka',"", ""'chubu',"", ""'area',"", ""'shirakawago',"", ""'takayamaetc',"", ""'catch',"", ""'train',"", ""'bus',"", ""'kanazawa',"", ""'spend',"", ""'least',"", ""'15',"", ""'days',"", ""'head',"", ""'shirakawago',"", ""'couple',"", ""'hours',"", ""'arrive',"", ""'takayama',"", ""'article',"", ""'information',"", ""'discount',"", ""'bus',"", ""'ticket',"", ""'chubu',"", ""'area',"", ""'mitsuboshi',"", ""'kaidou',"", ""'three',"", ""'star',"", ""'route',"", ""'ticket',"", ""'way',"", ""'takayama',"", ""'bus',"", ""'matsumoto',"", ""'nohi',"", ""'bus',"", ""'mitsuboshi',"", ""'kaidou',"", ""'three',"", ""'star',"", ""'route',"", ""'ticket',"", ""'matsumoto',"", ""'recommend',"", ""'drop',"", ""'daio',"", ""'wasabi',"", ""'farm',"", ""'real',"", ""'wasabi',"", ""'bullet',"", ""'train',"", ""'tokyo',"", ""'jr',"", ""'pass',"", ""'matsumoto',"", ""'help']""]",False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

why i ask? because it will be embarrassing if i suggest something that you have been to and you are not interested in. lol",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g294232-i525-k13544928-2nd_time_in_Japan_unique_experiences-Japan.html,2nd time in Japan; unique experiences,HiroSKMT,CN,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HiroSKMT?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,100,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,100,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,100.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,100,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,40000,"[""['question',"", ""'1',"", ""'visit',"", ""'trip',"", ""'question',"", ""'2',"", ""'interest',"", ""'nature',"", ""'onsen',"", ""'japanese',"", ""'ancient',"", ""'pop',"", ""'culture',"", ""'cuisine',"", ""'anime',"", ""'stuff',"", ""'one',"", ""'shoot',"", ""'sit',"", ""'visit',"", ""'specific',"", ""'anime',"", ""'cuisine',"", ""'embarrass',"", ""'something',"", ""'interest']""]",False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

that is true, but it seems the most common kind of ramen i came across are tonkotsu based. they may have small variation - like tonkotsu with misco. i found a new santouka store opened up a few months ago that is not too far from me (half an hour drive away). i may give it a try this weekend. but look at its menu, most of its ramen are tonkotsu this and tonkotsu that. the only exception is the vegetarian ramen, which i may have to find out what that meat looking topping is.

i also found out that amazon already have the cup ramens from ippudo and santouka. they are all over $10 for each pack. the ippudo one is now selling for usd 52.50 for 4, and the santouka one is selling for usd 46.54 for four. so ichiran will be joining them and probably sell at above usd 10 per pack as well.
the question will be whether there is enough customers willing to pay that kind of price for instant noodles. i am sure there are some, but i am not sure there will be many. they may be good for people who have no good ramen shop within one hour drive.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g298207-i5709-k13479516-Ichiran_to_release_instant_cup_noodle_on_Feb_15-Fukuoka_Fukuoka_Prefecture_Kyushu.html,Ichiran to release instant cup noodle on Feb 15,edofva,US,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/edofva?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,50,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,200,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,50.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,200,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,45000,"[""['everybody',"", ""'different',"", ""'taste',"", ""'fan',"", ""'tonkotsu',"", ""'pork',"", ""'broth',"", ""'true',"", ""'common',"", ""'kind',"", ""'ramen',"", ""'tonkotsu',"", ""'base',"", ""'may',"", ""'small',"", ""'variation',"", ""'tonkotsu',"", ""'misco',"", ""'new',"", ""'santouka',"", ""'store',"", ""'open',"", ""'months',"", ""'far',"", ""'half',"", ""'hour',"", ""'drive',"", ""'away',"", ""'may',"", ""'try',"", ""'weekend',"", ""'menu',"", ""'ramen',"", ""'tonkotsu',"", ""'tonkotsu',"", ""'exception',"", ""'vegetarian',"", ""'ramen',"", ""'may',"", ""'meat',"", ""'top',"", ""'amazon',"", ""'cup',"", ""'ramens',"", ""'ippudo',"", ""'santouka',"", ""'10',"", ""'pack',"", ""'ippudo',"", ""'one',"", ""'sell',"", ""'usd',"", ""'5250',"", ""'4',"", ""'santouka',"", ""'one',"", ""'sell',"", ""'usd',"", ""'4654',"", ""'four',"", ""'ichiran',"", ""'join',"", ""'sell',"", ""'usd',"", ""'10',"", ""'per',"", ""'pack',"", ""'question',"", ""'whether',"", ""'customers',"", ""'pay',"", ""'kind',"", ""'price',"", ""'instant',"", ""'noodles',"", ""'many',"", ""'may',"", ""'good',"", ""'people',"", ""'good',"", ""'ramen',"", ""'shop',"", ""'one',"", ""'hour',"", ""'drive']""]",False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

we've been to vietnam twice, but for a shorter length of time, and we stayed in hotels then. our favorite type of travel is visiting a large city for at least a month and doing day trips. we've found it gives us an entirely different perspective when we almost live like a local.
i you all have any other advice for our stay there, it would be greatly appreciated.

good to know that you're planning a summer trip to hokkaido.
based on your criteria, i'd suggest
1. lake side resort suimeikaku - a small onsen hotel with about 10 rooms along the lake rim of shikotsu-ko, about 30 min drive from cts (shin-chitose airport). in our stay in july 2018, most were adults. it serves italian dinner.
2. the windsor hotel toya resort - was once the venue of g7/8 meeting overlooking the beautiful and serene toya-ko. have no experience though would love to stay there when japan re-opens its border. there used to be a michelin 2-star french restaurant though not sure about the latest status.
should you be heading to biei/furano, i have more recommendations.
happy planning.

i made couple posts years ago recommending company.
however, they’ve recently changed policy want change review that, sadly, can’t recommend sushi wifi anymore.
do sim data provider. avoid.
the reasons follows:
the reason being, months now, sushi wifi data speed 0.01- 0.02mbps. literally slower dial-up.
i called sushi sent sim. issue... super crazy slow speeds. totally unusable internet. google news page takes minute load. forget youtube streaming.
after month (i buy data sim bic), send email, saying unlimited wifi limited 100gb month, that, speed limited (in case 0.01-0.02mbps)
the internet remain totally unusable data speed next month!
it good they’d told earlier didn’t. couple months later. using 100gb internet basically, next month.
cost same, they’ve limited data now, price pretty high given data effectively capped 100gb month ~8000 jpy/month. it’s unlimited data internet, hit 100gb, data speed throttled basically zero next month.
because this, can’t recommend them. buy data limited card (3 30gb fortnight). it’ll cheaper price, speed won’t throttled near zero data.
i’ve good experience sushi past, unfortunately, can’t honestly recommend anymore.

however, they’ve recently changed their policy and i want to change my review to say that, sadly, i can’t recommend sushi wifi anymore.
do not use this sim data provider. avoid.
the reasons as follows:
the reason being, for months now, my sushi wifi data speed was 0.01- 0.02mbps. literally slower than dial-up.
i called sushi and they sent me another sim. same issue... super crazy slow speeds. totally unusable internet. google news page takes a minute to load. forget youtube or any streaming.
after over a month of this (i had to buy another data sim at bic), they send me an email, saying that the unlimited wifi is now limited to 100gb a month, and if you use over that, the speed will be limited (in my case to 0.01-0.02mbps)
the internet will remain at an totally unusable data speed until the next month!
it would have been good if they’d told me this earlier but they didn’t. until a couple months later. so i was using over 100gb and had no internet basically, until the next month.
cost is still the same, even they’ve limited the data now, so price is now pretty high given that the data is effectively capped at 100gb a month ~8000 jpy/month. it’s not unlimited data internet, because once you hit 100gb, the data speed is throttled to basically zero until next month.
because of this, i can’t recommend them. just go and buy a data limited card for (3 x 30gb a fortnight). it’ll be cheaper or same price, and your speed won’t be throttled to near zero if you use over the data.
i’ve had good experience with sushi in the past, but unfortunately, i can’t honestly recommend them anymore.

after kyoto straight tokyo stop osaka?
we read packed trains leaving tokyo on/about december 29 thinking end tokyo december 29 fly january 2.
given amount time, recommend stays place. do, definitely want see tokyo fish market. go-karts tokyo? sounds crazy kids love it? bike tour kyoto worth it? family loves sushi ramen amazing sushi ramen recommendations welcome.
thanks advance.","hi everyone. we have flight vouchers that have to be used by march 2022 and so thinking about using them to fly from sfo to tokyo over the christmas holiday when our hs junior son and hs freshman daughter are out of school. understanding that covid could still throw a wrench into things, we thought that we would get our travel bug by doing some research/planning.
we would leave sfo on sat. dec 18 and arrive narita afternoon dec 19. spend one night in tokyo and then take the first train we can down to hiroshima. spend dec 20/21 there to see hiroshima and miyajima.
leave dec 22 am for kyoto. how long of a stay is recommended in kyoto?
after kyoto should we go straight to tokyo or do we also stop in osaka?
we have read about the packed trains leaving tokyo on/about december 29 and so we were thinking that we would end up back in tokyo before december 29 and then fly out from there on january 2.
given that amount of time, what do you all recommend for stays at each place. as for things to do, we definitely want to see the tokyo fish market. what about the go-karts in tokyo? sounds crazy but the kids would probably love it? is a bike tour in kyoto worth it? the family loves sushi and ramen and so amazing sushi and ramen recommendations are welcome.
thanks in advance.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g294232-i525-k13556687-Researching_for_December_2021_trip-Japan.html,Researching for December 2021 trip,tigermomma2017,Los Altos...,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tigermomma2017?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,100,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,100,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,100,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,100,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,100,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,100,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,100,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,100,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,80000,"[""['flight',"", ""'vouchers',"", ""'march',"", ""'2022',"", ""'fly',"", ""'sfo',"", ""'tokyo',"", ""'christmas',"", ""'holiday',"", ""'hs',"", ""'junior',"", ""'son',"", ""'hs',"", ""'freshman',"", ""'daughter',"", ""'school',"", ""'covid',"", ""'throw',"", ""'wrench',"", ""'travel',"", ""'bug',"", ""'research',"", ""'plan',"", ""'sfo',"", ""'sit',"", ""'dec',"", ""'18',"", ""'arrive',"", ""'narita',"", ""'afternoon',"", ""'dec',"", ""'19',"", ""'spend',"", ""'one',"", ""'night',"", ""'tokyo',"", ""'train',"", ""'hiroshima',"", ""'spend',"", ""'dec',"", ""'20',"", ""'21',"", ""'see',"", ""'hiroshima',"", ""'miyajima',"", ""'dec',"", ""'22',"", ""'kyoto',"", ""'long',"", ""'stay',"", ""'recommend',"", ""'kyoto',"", ""'kyoto',"", ""'straight',"", ""'tokyo',"", ""'stop',"", ""'osaka',"", ""'read',"", ""'pack',"", ""'train',"", ""'tokyo',"", ""'december',"", ""'29',"", ""'end',"", ""'tokyo',"", ""'december',"", ""'29',"", ""'fly',"", ""'january',"", ""'2',"", ""'amount',"", ""'time',"", ""'recommend',"", ""'stay',"", ""'place',"", ""'see',"", ""'tokyo',"", ""'fish',"", ""'market',"", ""'karts',"", ""'tokyo',"", ""'sound',"", ""'crazy',"", ""'kid',"", ""'bike',"", ""'tour',"", ""'kyoto',"", ""'worth',"", ""'family',"", ""'sushi',"", ""'ramen',"", ""'amaze',"", ""'sushi',"", ""'ramen',"", ""'recommendations',"", ""'welcome',"", ""'advance']""]",False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

edited: 10:18 pm, january 30,","hi, i'm on day #8 of my quarantine, so thought i would provide a little insight.
my asq is maple hotel in bang na. i'm in the basic room, cost is 33k. overall i'm very satisfied with my choice.
room: the room itself is quite spacious for 1 person. i have some workout videos on my laptop and there was just enough space for that. it's a basic room, not elegant, but clean, quiet and functional. there is a medium size fridge that i've made good use of because my gf kindly delivered a large care package of fruit and salads. the ac works fine and is quiet. the room also has a very good workspace and quality chair (this is important to me as some of the other asq's that i considered did not). wifi has been very dependable - there is a router in each room as well as ethernet cable. i did have some issues early on but it turned out to be an issue specific to my room and they promptly sent a technician to resolve it. they also lent me an ethernet adapter as my computer does not have a rj45 port. i was going to order from lazada, so when i asked if that was allowed, they said yes, but also mentioned they could lend me one. so big +1 for helpful service.
food: one thing i found out in doing my dd, is that some asq's do not have their own kitchen and rely on an outside caterer. as a result food choices are very limited (or nil) and there is no choice on timing. maple on the other hand prepares everything in-house and the choices are wide (about 20 choices for lunch/dinner). there is also about a 4 hour time window for each meal and you can request preferred times. so while i would rate the food as just ""decent"", the fact there is a broad choice and you can specify the time is a big positive. the food was never cold, often luke warm and sometimes piping hot (there are about 4 pasta choices and i think because the containers are filled to the brim, these were always nice and hot). the one negative i would say about the food is lack of vegatables. even off of the vegetarian menu (vegatables and rice for example), the vegatables were fried in oil and not that appealing. most dishes had just a slice of cucumber/tomatoe as garnish. luckily my gf brought me salads, without this i think i might contract scurvy lol.
getting outside: covid test was day 5 and got my negative result around 10:00 am the following day so i was able to leave my room on day 6. officially you are allowed 1 hr outside your room but this is not really enforced. i think the limit is just in place so that the outside areas don't get over-crowded. maple has quite large rooftop areas on each of the 3 towers with a capacity of 16, but there were typically only 3-4 people there at a time, so i think you could spend as much time up there as you like. also they had a different system depending on whether you were from a high risk country (us is in this group for sure and i assume uk). high riskers had black/brown/white wrist bands and others had orange/yellow/green. i believe that the high risk group are not allowed out of their room until after the second covid test.
balcony: this seems to be a big factor in choosing asq's (it was for me). all maple rooms have balconies usuable from day 0. i was wondering if perhaps this was over-rated, but now having been here i have to say having a balcony was a big plus, especially in the days that you are stuck in your room. even though my view was non-existent (i faced the other tower), it was still nice to put my chair out in the morning, brew my lavazza with my french press and sit out there while the temp was still pleasant.
staff: all very friendly, though most interaction is with the line app - both with the hotel and hospital (to report body temperature).
one negative for some people is that maple does not allow deliveries from 7-11. for me this is no big deal, as unlike just about everybody else, i rarely go to 7-11! there is one in my neighbourhood at home - in 20 years i've never gone in lol. i did bring my own snacks, coffee, tea etc and my gf can bring me anything else.
if i were to do it over, i would likely choose maple again. though if i were with my gf or other family members, i'd be inclined to go up a notch, but for a single low maintenace guy, maple is just fine.
cheers

i get my favorite khao mok gai. from a card table vendor at bangson morning market on weekends. have to hit it early; he often runs out before 08:00. 
ironically, the worst was a place recommended by mark weins. i guess he smothered it in so many chilis he couldn't tell the difference!
my first khao mun gai, and still my favorite, is in yannawa: 
one of the more interesting sauces is near the bma ""city hall"": 
the best side soup is in bangson: 
even with the large thai population in la, khao mun gai was always hard to find. there's too much preparation for the few people that want it. thai nakorn, oc, would make a batch for the staff from time to time. had to be lucky to catch them on that day.

ideally we would like a lovely beach holiday , with all facilities and have few days out doing river trips , elephant school , cooking school and more ...
not sure if to split days in bangkok , chiang mai and then to some beach place or head to beach place and do day trips ...

thanks in advance.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g186234-i637-k13489334-Devon_Cornwall-Cornwall_England.html,Devon/Cornwall,Nicola F,0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/H5796RHnicolaf?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,100,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,100.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,100,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,30000,"[""['place',"", ""'stay',"", ""'family',"", ""'4',"", ""'2',"", ""'adults',"", ""'2',"", ""'kid',"", ""'age',"", ""'7',"", ""'12',"", ""'travel',"", ""'scotland',"", ""'lodge',"", ""'cottage',"", ""'luxury',"", ""'outdoor',"", ""'poolnice',"", ""'garden',"", ""'patio',"", ""'area',"", ""'trip',"", ""'beach',"", ""'many',"", ""'areas',"", ""'stay',"", ""'children',"", ""'restrictions',"", ""'place',"", ""'end',"", ""'june',"", ""'july',"", ""'bbq',"", ""'possibly',"", ""'play',"", ""'area',"", ""'advance']""]",False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

any imput experience appreciated. much .( kind ) :)","hello all and thank you for reading.
i am 67 years old, fairly well travelled but have not been to indonesia (yet).
next october, 2022, i am considering spending a month in bali. two weeks volunteering in ubud teaching kindergarten and primary school. the week prior and the week after will be spent travelling around.
i hear mixed reviews of bali. i know that nothing is the way it was 10 or 20 years ago. 'tourists have ruined the place' is common on so many destinations around the world.
but, for those of you who have been recently, what is your opinion? and i know everyone has an opinion and i will listen to all the good and bad.
i have never been so have nothing to compare to the 'way it was'. i also know, like thailand , laos and other destinations in asia there are those places that have the 'full moon parties' and predominantly young people wanting to drink and have fun
i will most likely not be going to those places, my idea of fun has changed over the years :)
i am looking for great snorkelling, beautiful scenery, temples, small villages great food , meeting people and local vibe. i am unfortunately not able to do difficult hiking anymore, but some easier ones would be most welcome.
i am hoping my friend of the same vintage will join me, although i could be by myself which is fine too.
my husband will meet me after wards in thailand for the month of november.
