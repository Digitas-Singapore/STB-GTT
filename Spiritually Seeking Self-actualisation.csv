the imperial club lounge you are referring to closed in 2018 and has been replaced by a far larger and more luxurious lounge in the east tower.
the word “scrum” indicates a level of chaos and disorganisation and as previously stated ,in 8 years ( equivalent of almost 4 months)using the imperial club both new and old i have never seen anything remotely like this.
i see that you have never been in the imperial club so am unsure that other than reading some negative reviews you can stare what the imperial club is like. there are many positive reviews of the imperial club and its popularity seems to indicate that the vast majority enjoy the experience.
breakfast at saffron/kalidescope usually involves waiting in a lengthy queue stretching outside the restaurant.

not many now though. some hotels allow you to book leisure day passes to go swimming, avoid the public swimming baths at troutbeck it gets very busy. nowhere is flat in the lakes to cycle except maybe the old keswick railway line, but ask before you hire, i'm sure they can give advice. brockhole on windermere has lots of activities for kids, they also used to do summer classes for adventure things but they book up very quickly. number one thing to do is the honister via ferrata, you will never forget the experience. for wet days (you will get them) kendal indoor climbing center is great, you can just have a drink and watch your child learn to climb safely, there is one at ambleside as well but not tried that, it is a lot smaller. we prefer ambleside as it is central for most places, it has craxy golf, putting, tennis as well and some easier walks, such as to grasmere. as someone said ambleside yha is good, best place in the lakes to sit outside and have a drink right on the lake, better than the pubs near by. platty kayaking on derwent is really good, make sure it is not a windy day

first to note to avoid any confusion that the kembali villas you listed in post #3 (perhaps it was an auto link) is not kembali beach bungalows in amed.
kembali villas linked in post #3 are in seminyak.
do you dive or just snorkeling.
pemuteran
check exact location of any property carefully. pemuteran spreads out a long way also inland.
pemuteran is mrs pigs favourite after amed.
we stay at 
you have to walk down the beach a little to enter the sea for snorkeling. main reasons is that their are a lot of sea urchins in the sea along with low lying reefs close to shore. there is a signpost.
entry is more or less in front of the pondok sari.
you will also find the biorock reef restoration project.
the only thing is that pemuteran bay is very sandy (just offshore). at full moon/spring tides/windy/choppy seas the sand can get churned up in the bay. even snorkeling close to shore it can be like snorkeling in a milkshake. literally can’t see your hand in front of your face. biorock not visible.
i’ve been diving well offshore and when in shallower water 10-15m on a sunny day it was like diving in a snowglobe with all the glistening sand.
i use the dive centre on the beach behind the swimming pool/wellness massage centre.

they have 2 dive boats. one rib and one larger fibreglass hull boat.
if only snorkeling you can enquire at the dive centre or others along the beach, about snorkeling trips menjangan.
dive trips often willing to take snorkelers if space. advantage is the boat goes from the beach.
you can arrange snorkeling trips locally but this may involve a road trip in a minibus before picking up a local boat.

my fitness has dropped a bit but i can still walk around 7 miles and do runs. but, that depends on how steep the terrain is!
what i was considering - train down to exeter, ( early ) bus to okehampton. walk route, stay in the pub, walk back to okehampton the following day. sounds like it might require 2 nights perhaps. we will travel light for 1 eve i think.
lydford is nice. i've eaten at the castle inn a couple of times and had a drink there. thanks for the recommendation.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g186252-i5309-k13630090-Walk_From_Okehampton_Town_Look-Dartmoor_National_Park_Devon_England.html,"Walk From Okehampton Town, Look",jodD6373OY,"Merton, United...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jodD6373OY?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,100,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,100,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,100,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,100,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,40000,"[""['reply',"", ""'penmere',"", ""'quite',"", ""'sketchy',"", ""'moment',"", ""'familiar',"", ""'okehampton',"", ""'try',"", ""'tighten',"", ""'ideas',"", ""'see',"", ""'feasible',"", ""'knowledge',"", ""'bodmin',"", ""'moor',"", ""'grow',"", ""'walk',"", ""'lot',"", ""'teen',"", ""'fitness',"", ""'drop',"", ""'walk',"", ""'7',"", ""'miles',"", ""'run',"", ""'steep',"", ""'terrain',"", ""'train',"", ""'exeter',"", ""'early',"", ""'bus',"", ""'okehampton',"", ""'walk',"", ""'route',"", ""'stay',"", ""'pub',"", ""'walk',"", ""'okehampton',"", ""'day',"", ""'sound',"", ""'require',"", ""'2',"", ""'nights',"", ""'travel',"", ""'light',"", ""'1',"", ""'eve',"", ""'lydford',"", ""'eat',"", ""'castle',"", ""'inn',"", ""'couple',"", ""'time',"", ""'drink',"", ""'recommendation']""]",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

so i need suggestions on which would be the best island to visit. they like spending the day on the beach (but would need sunbeds) - so probably a beach-front hotel would be ideal, and to be in walking distance of shops, bars and restaurants.
i'm almost set on centara beach resort & spa in ao nang, krabi but would love to hear others' ideas or opinions.

spent a couple of night a bit up the road from there in february. walked down towards the resort in search of lunch but that particular area is dead.
ao nang beach was lively enough on the weekend as it is a local's spot and there was plenty of restaurants open, so no worries about eating. however, the side roads are ghost townish and that stretch of beach is pretty average.
unless you (or they) have some specific reason for visiting that area, (the islands ) you might reconsider and perhaps take a look at phuket.

-book the guided tour in advance. it was sold out for the day i went, and i had been waiting many years to visit the cathedral (romanesque architecture is my absolute favorite). it did not even occur to me that i needed to book many days in advance. i honestly thought i would cry when they kindly said it was sold out*. i texted my children and husband; my husband offered to try to find me a private tour guide immediately, but there was not way that could have worked out. very sweet of him, though.
-tour groups are currently limited to 5 or 6 ppl total. i was confused bc there was at least 1 large school group there on that day; many more than 5-6 ppl. i realize the rules come from the uk govt, not the cathedral. i realize that the cathedral is doing its best to follow what seem to be confusing rules (a big school group = ok, +6 adults in a tour group = not ok). it is what it is--just know them before you go.
-reserve a table in the cafe if you think you might eat there, or eat after 2pm.
*i did not cry, although i may never get to go to durham again (i live in tx), because of the volunteers at the cathedral. i would especially like to highlight hazel, a docent who was so helpful. she was like an angel. she answered my many questions in great detail and was the best of the british--kind, knowledgeable, and with a reserve that comes from a deep well of very good manners. she made me feel i could ask as many questions as i wanted to.
another female docent, tall, thin, with a sporty short haircut, encouraged me to buy a guidebook (which i did) and it was so helpful. many thanks to her.
it was a miserable day--chilly and pouring rain. a chipper younger woman at the entrance pointed out the river path to the bridge, and i'm so glad she did; it was a wonderful (although chilly) walk.
i arrived on a train from london; there is a bus that runs you to the cathedral every 15 minutes or so. many thanks to the women working in the station that day who pointed me in the right direction to catch the bus.
the bus driver was so nice and friendly. such an asset to durham and i'm sorry i did not make note of his name.
i had not eaten all day and, after seeing most of the cathedral, i went down to the cafe on a chance; there was 1 unreserved table at 2:15 (the guided tour started at 2). the women working in the cafe were very helpful. i had the lasagna special (lasagna, bread, and a salad) and a giant (hot and cozy) latte. my lunch was delicious and perfect for the weather.
there was a young, young woman in the gift shop; she was precious and sweet. the shop has a very good book on the architecture of the cathedral which i have been reading.
i wandered around the immediate area before catching the bus back to the train station and back to london. 6 hours on a train; 3 hours in durham.
all of the people i have referenced were at their posts after 12:20 on july 6. they deserve recognition. if there is any way to forward my thanks to them, please let me know.
the cathedral is exceptional and durham, even in the pouring rain, was charming. it was well worth the 3 hours there and 3 hours back on the train.

it's good to see they're digging into the detail a bit on returnees, even if somewhat arbitrarily.
interesting to see about qatar and their load factors, they were also restricting ticketing ex-uae recently (after you'd bagged yours) and some of the other carriers e.g. saudia are restricting intra-gcc ticketing also.

just seen it this morning and i’m fuming!
i bought a ticket with qatar and will be leaving friday night but i’m not sure how much ££ i’m going to get back from emirates (i’m literally just about to cancel the flight with them as the flight we had booked was with a 20h wait in dublin). we didn’t know if our options would diminish or increase so took the leap and booked with qatar to be on the safe side.
we have been stretching ourselves massively (this is our 6th week in dubai) and we need to get home as we have a building refurbishment going on and we miss our two dogs more than anything.

i wanted to compare meal experiences at designated quarantine hotels for future trips back to hk for myself and friends and family.
i am staying at mira moon. they provide 3 choices for each day for each of the 3 meals of breakfast, lunch and dinner - local asian, international and vegetarian. the menu choices list for all 21 days of my stay was sent to me upon booking, and i was provided with a link for each day to make my meal selections. meals must be selected 5 days in advance and if i fail to select, the hotel would select for me. i had a very early morning arrival flight so i selected lunch and dinner for the first day. for the last day of the quarantine stay, only breakfast is provided.
dessert is provided with lunch and dinner, but no choice, just the daily dessert. to give you an idea of the experience so far:
day 1 lunch - stewed chicken in red wine sauce, garlic spaghetti, corn bread roll and mini croissant, steamed vegetables (carrots, broccoli, cauliflower), mini muffin with icing dessert. meal served in paper containers, cutlery is thin wood disposable. chicken a bit hard and solid, somewhat expected in bulk food preparation, garlic spaghetti really flavourful, good amount of vegetables, corn bread roll not much like corn bread and more like a roll with a slight corn taste, mini croissant good, hard to say what the mini muffin is as all i could taste was the sweet icing. the main rectangular tray container had 4 separate compartments to separate the different foods and keep everything looking nice and neat, and there were separate round containers for the bread and dessert. overall, large filling portion size, fairly healthy with good amount of vegetables, good taste and well presented. the disposable wood cutlery is difficult to use as they bend when pressed so the knife took a lot of effort to cut anything and the fork took multiple stabs to pick up pieces of chicken.
day 1 dinner - viennese fried pork filets with fries with ketchup and tartar sauce, cucumber salad with fish roe and salad sauce topping, bread roll and mini-croissant, dessert was some kind of

i fill whole month. hopefully, info enough plan. info leave comments fill contact form :)","i would probably fly into tokyo, spend a few days there and start moving to chubu (central region of japan's main island). i'd stop by nagano for few days to visit the monkey park, sightseeing around nagano station, and drop by matsumoto for the castle and the wasabi farm!
here's more info about the wasabi farm: 
on the way to the monkey park, i'll also stop by a town called obuse for its chestnut dessert and if you are interested in ukiyo-e art. 
then from matsumoto, i will use one of the discounted bus tickets to get to shirakawago, takayama, kamikochi, and then kanazawa. 
from kanazawa, i'd take a bullet train or high-speed bus to kyoto/osaka. i'd probably stay in osaka instead of kyoto cos the hotels in kyoto are usually more expensive. a couple of days in each city and i'd also extend my trip to cities close to osaka such as himeji and okayama.
himeji castle was ranked the best castle in japan so highly recommended. and don't forget to drop by its garden just next to it cos is beautiful. 
and if you have time, you can also visit mt. shosha in himeji that gives you a great view.

edited: 10:18 pm, january 30,","hi, i'm on day #8 of my quarantine, so thought i would provide a little insight.
my asq is maple hotel in bang na. i'm in the basic room, cost is 33k. overall i'm very satisfied with my choice.
room: the room itself is quite spacious for 1 person. i have some workout videos on my laptop and there was just enough space for that. it's a basic room, not elegant, but clean, quiet and functional. there is a medium size fridge that i've made good use of because my gf kindly delivered a large care package of fruit and salads. the ac works fine and is quiet. the room also has a very good workspace and quality chair (this is important to me as some of the other asq's that i considered did not). wifi has been very dependable - there is a router in each room as well as ethernet cable. i did have some issues early on but it turned out to be an issue specific to my room and they promptly sent a technician to resolve it. they also lent me an ethernet adapter as my computer does not have a rj45 port. i was going to order from lazada, so when i asked if that was allowed, they said yes, but also mentioned they could lend me one. so big +1 for helpful service.
food: one thing i found out in doing my dd, is that some asq's do not have their own kitchen and rely on an outside caterer. as a result food choices are very limited (or nil) and there is no choice on timing. maple on the other hand prepares everything in-house and the choices are wide (about 20 choices for lunch/dinner). there is also about a 4 hour time window for each meal and you can request preferred times. so while i would rate the food as just ""decent"", the fact there is a broad choice and you can specify the time is a big positive. the food was never cold, often luke warm and sometimes piping hot (there are about 4 pasta choices and i think because the containers are filled to the brim, these were always nice and hot). the one negative i would say about the food is lack of vegatables. even off of the vegetarian menu (vegatables and rice for example), the vegatables were fried in oil and not that appealing. most dishes had just a slice of cucumber/tomatoe as garnish. luckily my gf brought me salads, without this i think i might contract scurvy lol.
getting outside: covid test was day 5 and got my negative result around 10:00 am the following day so i was able to leave my room on day 6. officially you are allowed 1 hr outside your room but this is not really enforced. i think the limit is just in place so that the outside areas don't get over-crowded. maple has quite large rooftop areas on each of the 3 towers with a capacity of 16, but there were typically only 3-4 people there at a time, so i think you could spend as much time up there as you like. also they had a different system depending on whether you were from a high risk country (us is in this group for sure and i assume uk). high riskers had black/brown/white wrist bands and others had orange/yellow/green. i believe that the high risk group are not allowed out of their room until after the second covid test.
balcony: this seems to be a big factor in choosing asq's (it was for me). all maple rooms have balconies usuable from day 0. i was wondering if perhaps this was over-rated, but now having been here i have to say having a balcony was a big plus, especially in the days that you are stuck in your room. even though my view was non-existent (i faced the other tower), it was still nice to put my chair out in the morning, brew my lavazza with my french press and sit out there while the temp was still pleasant.
staff: all very friendly, though most interaction is with the line app - both with the hotel and hospital (to report body temperature).
one negative for some people is that maple does not allow deliveries from 7-11. for me this is no big deal, as unlike just about everybody else, i rarely go to 7-11! there is one in my neighbourhood at home - in 20 years i've never gone in lol. i did bring my own snacks, coffee, tea etc and my gf can bring me anything else.
if i were to do it over, i would likely choose maple again. though if i were with my gf or other family members, i'd be inclined to go up a notch, but for a single low maintenace guy, maple is just fine.
cheers

if you could, i would say madinat hotels are great and would be my first pick. not sure how long you are in town for but why not have a few days up by dubai mall on arrival, then move to madinat for the remainder of the stay? budget would even out over the week.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g295424-i872-k13479172-Rixos_premium_JBR_or_palm_hotels-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html,Rixos premium JBR / or palm hotels,Sean R,UK,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/275seanr?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,50,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,50,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,50,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,200,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,27500,"[""['jzs',"", ""'worth',"", ""'access',"", ""'wild',"", ""'wadi',"", ""'alone',"", ""'hotel',"", ""'staff',"", ""'group',"", ""'house',"", ""'locationwise',"", ""'rixos',"", ""'way',"", ""'palm',"", ""'explore',"", ""'city',"", ""'fairmont',"", ""'good',"", ""'property',"", ""'wow',"", ""'jzs',"", ""'westin',"", ""'mainland',"", ""'6',"", ""'11',"", ""'old',"", ""'big',"", ""'pool',"", ""'ice',"", ""'cream',"", ""'fun',"", ""'parent',"", ""'right',"", ""'sun',"", ""'shin',"", ""'madinat',"", ""'hotels',"", ""'pick',"", ""'long',"", ""'town',"", ""'days',"", ""'dubai',"", ""'mall',"", ""'arrival',"", ""'move',"", ""'madinat',"", ""'remainder',"", ""'stay',"", ""'budget',"", ""'week']""]",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

re: 15
i agree.. i was expecting this massive new plan to come out... and we actually got ... not a whole lot.
it kind of has the “feel” of a physical lock down, in so much as after 23.00, it looks like very very few things will actually be permitted to be open and accessible for someone to go to... but i cede it could have been much more draconian as well.
as far as the red zone goes, the only item that surprised me a bit was the inclusion of supermarkets... only because in *my* mind i don’t see them on the same vein as a 7/11, mall or whatever... but that’s me.... i just see them as “get-your-meat-bread-and-veg” kind of places.
all the rest seems to be pretty much “in line” with what i had read was possible or what i myself expected.

have a look through some trip reports, top things to do in dubai etc (on the main web page) and work out the things you both want to do: ok so we know you want atlantis for a day and a desert safari (that is normally from around 3pm to 9pm). the other use of your days will then decide where you lay your heads at night. no point staying in the marina if you want to mooch around the older parts of town in the souks and spend a day at dubai mall.
if you want to do the desert, you should think about asking your desert company to drop you off at dubai mall for the fountain show and shopping/drinking/coffees - you don't have to go back to your hotel from the camp.
taxis are cheap by uk standards but 30 minutes in a taxi is still 30 minutes in a taxi. metro is a good option as it gives you another view of the city.
i would also be thinking about hitting at.mosphere, neos and the the vault for drinks - the latter two don't have cover charges i believe or a minimum spend.
if you have the time, tell your hubby to get himself into a backstreet barber for a proper wetshave - superb experience and dirt cheap. satwa is my fav spot: there are options all over the place.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g295424-i872-k13524562-Honeymoon_where_to_stay_help-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html,"Honeymoon - where to stay, help!!",Sean R,UK,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/275seanr?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,50,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,200,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,50,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,50,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,50,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,50,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,50,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,35000,"[""['approach',"", ""'wrong',"", ""'way',"", ""'work',"", ""'stay',"", ""'trip',"", ""'report',"", ""'top',"", ""'dubai',"", ""'main',"", ""'web',"", ""'page',"", ""'work',"", ""'atlantis',"", ""'day',"", ""'desert',"", ""'safari',"", ""'normally',"", ""'3pm',"", ""'9pm',"", ""'days',"", ""'lay',"", ""'head',"", ""'night',"", ""'point',"", ""'stay',"", ""'marina',"", ""'mooch',"", ""'older',"", ""'part',"", ""'town',"", ""'souks',"", ""'spend',"", ""'day',"", ""'dubai',"", ""'mall',"", ""'desert',"", ""'desert',"", ""'company',"", ""'drop',"", ""'dubai',"", ""'mall',"", ""'fountain',"", ""'show',"", ""'shop',"", ""'drink',"", ""'coffees',"", ""'hotel',"", ""'camp',"", ""'taxis',"", ""'cheap',"", ""'uk',"", ""'standards',"", ""'30',"", ""'minutes',"", ""'taxi',"", ""'30',"", ""'minutes',"", ""'taxi',"", ""'metro',"", ""'good',"", ""'view',"", ""'city',"", ""'hit',"", ""'atmosphere',"", ""'neos',"", ""'vault',"", ""'drink',"", ""'latter',"", ""'two',"", ""'cover',"", ""'charge',"", ""'minimum',"", ""'spend',"", ""'time',"", ""'tell',"", ""'hubby',"", ""'backstreet',"", ""'barber',"", ""'proper',"", ""'wetshave',"", ""'superb',"", ""'experience',"", ""'dirt',"", ""'cheap',"", ""'satwa',"", ""'fav',"", ""'spot',"", ""'options',"", ""'place']""]",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

i'm thinking atlantis good choice family oriented? less particular hotel?
they route singapore stopping dubai days meet us, rest time spend pick resort suited honeymoon.
also planning major sightseeing anything them, possibly dubai mall dessert safari, stroll marina evening mainly spending time together hotel pool/beach worries me.
they obviously fine usual swimsuits holidays place lot instagram models come pose tiny bikinis them,
thank","hi guys we are planning our honeymoon to the maldives and on the way back stopping in dubai to meet up with our parents who are quite reserved, i note dubai in general is very relaxed in terms of topless sunbathing, thong bikinis etc
i'm thinking would atlantis be a good choice as it is very family oriented? so maybe there would be less of this at this particular hotel?
they will be on route to singapore so will only be stopping in dubai for 3 days to meet us, the rest of the time we spend there we will pick another resort that will be more suited to a honeymoon.
also we aren't planning any major sightseeing or anything for while we are there with them, possibly just dubai mall and a dessert safari, probably a stroll around the marina one evening but we will mainly just be spending time together at the hotel pool/beach so this is what worries me.
they are obviously fine with the usual swimsuits on holidays but just if it is a place where a lot of instagram models come to pose in their tiny bikinis it may not be for them,

no, 10 days is too long for chiang mai and any other single destination in thailand for a first-time visitor to thailand, chiang mai is not centrally-located, and does not offer a well-rounded thailand travel experience.
yes, 10 days is adequate if you want to earn a ph.d. in chiang mai. as michaelb stated above, chiang mai provides a good base for exploring the surrounding cities that he mentioned above, especially exploring chiang rai in the north.
i would combine chiang mai with a beach destination, not because of the interest in beaches or water activities, but because beach destinations offer a more relaxed atmosphere than the urban cities.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g293917-i9325-k13535731-Spending_Time_in_Chiang_Mai_Muay_Thai-Chiang_Mai.html,Spending Time in Chiang Mai & Muay Thai,CharlesR,US,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VacationerCritic?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,100.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,100,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,100,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,100,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,100,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,100,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,60000,"[""['chiang',"", ""'mai',"", ""'good',"", ""'base',"", ""'10',"", ""'days',"", ""'long',"", ""'vacation',"", ""'1st',"", ""'muay',"", ""'thai',"", ""'gyms',"", ""'exist',"", ""'practically',"", ""'city',"", ""'thailand',"", ""'hotel',"", ""'arrange',"", ""'muay',"", ""'thai',"", ""'workouts',"", ""'hotel',"", ""'request',"", ""'10',"", ""'days',"", ""'long',"", ""'chiang',"", ""'mai',"", ""'single',"", ""'destination',"", ""'thailand',"", ""'time',"", ""'visitor',"", ""'thailand',"", ""'chiang',"", ""'mai',"", ""'centrally',"", ""'locate',"", ""'round',"", ""'thailand',"", ""'travel',"", ""'experience',"", ""'10',"", ""'days',"", ""'adequate',"", ""'earn',"", ""'phd',"", ""'chiang',"", ""'mai',"", ""'michaelb',"", ""'state',"", ""'chiang',"", ""'mai',"", ""'provide',"", ""'good',"", ""'base',"", ""'explore',"", ""'surround',"", ""'cities',"", ""'explore',"", ""'chiang',"", ""'rai',"", ""'north',"", ""'combine',"", ""'chiang',"", ""'mai',"", ""'beach',"", ""'destination',"", ""'interest',"", ""'beach',"", ""'water',"", ""'activities',"", ""'beach',"", ""'destinations',"", ""'relax',"", ""'atmosphere',"", ""'urban',"", ""'cities']""]",True,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

it isn't.
covid is here to stay and the concern for the future is not ""when it stops"" - it won't the concern is how will countries deal with it.
te idea that in the next few months things will ""return to normal"" is pie in the sky.
as yet thailand has shown little ability to deal with a major upturn due to new variants and other countries are heading into 3rd and 4th waves - i certainly can't see thailand importing huge numbers of tourist from those regions.
as for the vaccine - it may protect certain age groups at first but it is not a universal panacea, it won'y have a significant effect until herd immunity at 70% is achieved - and thailand is less than 1% on full double injections.
after these goals have been achieved the world will then need foster jabs all round in the next year.
thinking a return to normal by next year therefore is very unlikely. samui has been relatively lucky so far but one can detect there is a growing complacency amongst expats especially, is this a case of pride before the fall?",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g293918-i7560-k13404601-Small_steps_to_Samui_Thailand_re_opening-Ko_Samui_Surat_Thani_Province.html,Small steps to Samui (Thailand) re-opening?,MrCycling 🚵‍♂️,Asia,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrCycling?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,50,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,200,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,50,0,50,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,50,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,30000,"[""['misconception',"", ""'covid',"", ""'suddenly',"", ""'stop',"", ""'isnt',"", ""'covid',"", ""'stay',"", ""'concern',"", ""'future',"", ""'stop',"", ""'concern',"", ""'countries',"", ""'deal',"", ""'te',"", ""'idea',"", ""'months',"", ""'normal',"", ""'pie',"", ""'sky',"", ""'thailand',"", ""'show',"", ""'little',"", ""'ability',"", ""'deal',"", ""'major',"", ""'upturn',"", ""'due',"", ""'new',"", ""'variants',"", ""'countries',"", ""'head',"", ""'3rd',"", ""'4th',"", ""'wave',"", ""'see',"", ""'thailand',"", ""'import',"", ""'huge',"", ""'number',"", ""'tourist',"", ""'regions',"", ""'vaccine',"", ""'may',"", ""'protect',"", ""'certain',"", ""'age',"", ""'group',"", ""'universal',"", ""'panacea',"", ""'wony',"", ""'significant',"", ""'effect',"", ""'herd',"", ""'immunity',"", ""'70',"", ""'achieve',"", ""'thailand',"", ""'less',"", ""'1',"", ""'full',"", ""'double',"", ""'injections',"", ""'goals',"", ""'achieve',"", ""'world',"", ""'foster',"", ""'jab',"", ""'round',"", ""'normal',"", ""'therefore',"", ""'unlikely',"", ""'samui',"", ""'relatively',"", ""'lucky',"", ""'far',"", ""'one',"", ""'detect',"", ""'grow',"", ""'complacency',"", ""'amongst',"", ""'expats',"", ""'case',"", ""'pride',"", ""'fall']""]",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

amy","hi,
we are spending a weekend in the west country at the end of may, and our plan is to spend sunday afternoon/evening in bath and enjoy a sunday roast before we head back up north. one of our party members is vegan, and doesn't like nut roast, so just wondering if anyone can recommend a good place for both vegans and meat lovers for us to make a reservation?
traditional sunday roast isn't completely essential, and we will consider other places that cater well for both types of diet.
bath city centre is preferred, but happy to go slightly outside for something extra special.
thanks so much for your help!

i tried a free sample of feni during my first visit to goa in 2003 and thought it tasted awful. i think i'll stick to scotch....... i wonder if they have chivas regal in uk food banks? :-)",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g297604-i6045-k12304518-Feni_Available_to_buy_in_the_UK-Goa.html,Feni - Available to buy in the UK,Sue,"Wendron, United...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bridgir?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,100,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,100,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,100,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,30000,"[""['evylyn',"", ""'learn',"", ""'something',"", ""'interest',"", ""'video',"", ""'show',"", ""'local',"", ""'goan',"", ""'family',"", ""'produce',"", ""'feni',"", ""'wellington',"", ""'boot',"", ""'cashews',"", ""'grow',"", ""'tree',"", ""'walnuts',"", ""'horse',"", ""'chestnuts',"", ""'assume',"", ""'fruit',"", ""'season',"", ""'outside',"", ""'tourist',"", ""'season',"", ""'see',"", ""'fruit',"", ""'cashew',"", ""'tree',"", ""'observant',"", ""'try',"", ""'free',"", ""'sample',"", ""'feni',"", ""'visit',"", ""'goa',"", ""'2003',"", ""'taste',"", ""'awful',"", ""'ill',"", ""'stick',"", ""'scotch',"", ""'wonder',"", ""'chivas',"", ""'regal',"", ""'uk',"", ""'food',"", ""'bank']""]",False,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

we just don’t want to hit a month that is a majority of the time raining every day, and may november appeared to be good months, we want to relax by a pool day on beach as well as the sights sounds of hong kong.
also hoping may 22 all should be vaccinated appreciate world view of uk however we will all be vaccinated by september latest this year folk here think we are crackers as they feel hong kong china may not have same time frame for vaccinations due to population number.
i can actually see us all having to pay privately to get a covid test proving negative before entry to country’s as well as proof of vaccinations at least our first two are free.

if sightseeing priority downtown area good shout nightlife higher priority list marina suit better.
july isn’t best month sightseeing due high humidity walking long distances isn’t particularly pleasant. fountains, burj khalifa done together you’re looking afternoon tea could combine tea atmosphere.
as nights out, many ladies nights wednesdays worth taking advantage thursday going main night out, it’s start weekend busy night.
i’d inclined brunch friday i’d pick depending plan stay - brunch you’ll want earlier night suit early onward flight following day.
personally short visit, i’d forgo desert safari they’re touristy gimmicky i’d rather spend limited time seeing dubai

if sightseeing is a priority then the downtown area is good shout but if nightlife is higher up on your priority list then the marina might suit you better.
july isn’t the best month for sightseeing due to the high humidity and walking long distances isn’t particularly pleasant. the fountains, burj khalifa etc can be done together and if you’re looking for afternoon tea then you could combine this with tea at atmosphere.
as for your nights out, there are many ladies nights on wednesdays which are worth taking advantage of but thursday is going to be your main night out, it’s the start of the weekend and a busy night.
i’d then be inclined to do a brunch on friday but i’d pick this depending on where you plan to stay - after brunch you’ll probably want an earlier night which will suit you as you have to be up early for your onward flight the following day.
personally for such a short visit, i’d forgo the desert safari as they’re touristy and a bit gimmicky and i’d rather spend my limited time seeing more of dubai

there fair see abu dhabi emirates and, whilst region open, discount side trip muscat oman (especially 'dubai' early).
i weeks enough time see highlights, couple day trips abu dhabi (the mosque well worth look), beaten track hit beach/pool couple days too.
off beaten track: head satwa see real workers live - lots fun, busy evening - indian/pakistani food, amazing iranian cheese bread cheap haircut, wet shave head massage. change $15 (probably above!)","it also depends how much money you want to spend to see the sites. if you want to take things easy and use public transport rather jump in taxis all of the time it will slow you down a little.
there is also a fair bit to see in abu dhabi and the other emirates and, whilst you are in the region and if things are open, i wouldn't discount a side trip to muscat in oman (especially if you do 'dubai' early).
i think in 2 weeks you'll have enough time to see the highlights, a couple of day trips to abu dhabi (the mosque is well worth a look), get off the beaten track and hit the beach/pool for a couple of days too.
off the beaten track: head down to satwa to see how the real workers live - its a lots of fun, busy in the evening - great for indian/pakistani food, some amazing iranian cheese bread and a cheap haircut, wet shave and head massage. you'll get change out of $15 (probably for all of the above!)",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g295424-i872-k13527817-How_Long_to_Visit_Dubai-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html,How Long to Visit Dubai,Sean R,UK,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/275seanr?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,100,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,100,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,100,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,100,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,100,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,50000,"[""['much',"", ""'money',"", ""'spend',"", ""'see',"", ""'sit',"", ""'easy',"", ""'public',"", ""'transport',"", ""'jump',"", ""'taxis',"", ""'time',"", ""'slow',"", ""'little',"", ""'fair',"", ""'see',"", ""'abu',"", ""'dhabi',"", ""'emirates',"", ""'whilst',"", ""'region',"", ""'open',"", ""'discount',"", ""'side',"", ""'trip',"", ""'muscat',"", ""'oman',"", ""'dubai',"", ""'early',"", ""'2',"", ""'weeks',"", ""'time',"", ""'see',"", ""'highlight',"", ""'couple',"", ""'day',"", ""'trip',"", ""'abu',"", ""'dhabi',"", ""'mosque',"", ""'worth',"", ""'beat',"", ""'track',"", ""'hit',"", ""'beach',"", ""'pool',"", ""'couple',"", ""'days',"", ""'beat',"", ""'track',"", ""'head',"", ""'satwa',"", ""'see',"", ""'real',"", ""'workers',"", ""'live',"", ""'lot',"", ""'fun',"", ""'busy',"", ""'indian',"", ""'pakistani',"", ""'food',"", ""'amaze',"", ""'iranian',"", ""'cheese',"", ""'bread',"", ""'cheap',"", ""'haircut',"", ""'wet',"", ""'shave',"", ""'head',"", ""'massage',"", ""'15']""]",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

","i went to greece in 1976 when my husband and i camped around europe for four months. i’m sure it’s changed a bit since then. we left our car at a campground in athens and took the ferry to crete, where an elderly man met the ferry and persuaded about six of us to follow him on foot to his home where he and his wife ran a pensione. we stayed for three or four nights while we explored the island. they served us an amazing meal under the grape trellis every night. we returned to the athens campground and, being young and foolish, we discovered it was orthodox easter when all the shops were closed. we managed to find a small stall somewhere where we bought a dozen eggs. those eggs and a loaf of bread were eked out over the few days of closed stores. i’d love to go back to greece if we’re ever allowed to leave canada again!

we liked the hyatt: grounds are great and the pools are very good. great ice cream shop near the breakfast room from memory - although its going back a while. we popped over the road to boardwalk for dinner a few times overlooking the creek at the yacht club - not a bad place to be shipwrecked.

at present lner's service in first is reduced, with the offer of a packaged sweet or savoury snack and a hot or cold drink as well as a hot toastie (contents depend on the time of day). lner have resumed trolley service to the passengers at their seats, and they may have returned to the usual multiple offers of drinks and snacks. if their catering supplier hasn't changed the biscuits and cake slices they offer are quite good ... said wishing i could book a rail ticket and look forward to their ginger cake slices.
since you plan to travel next year let's say that services will be back to what they were pre-pandemic. with tickets in first you could visit the lounge at edinburgh waverley for a cup of tea and some biscuits, a nice way to start the trip. the fastest trains to alnmouth take just over an hour which may be too short a trip for a hot meal but perhaps not by that time.
standard would be fine for the trip from waverley station, but if you want to experience first even for a short trip then do so. seating is 2-1 rather than 2-2 with more pitch between rows and perhaps a quieter carriage.
you certainly don't have to decide what to book now as tickets for may next year won't be available for many months.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g186525-i108-k13518491-LNER_first_class_service-Edinburgh_Scotland.html,LNER first class service,TravellerPlus,CA,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravellerPlus?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,200,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,50,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,200,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,200,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,62500,"[""['plan',"", ""'edinburgh',"", ""'may',"", ""'2022',"", ""'day',"", ""'trip',"", ""'alnwick',"", ""'become',"", ""'word',"", ""'suspect',"", ""'travel',"", ""'least',"", ""'one',"", ""'person',"", ""'case',"", ""'one',"", ""'may',"", ""'worth',"", ""'buy',"", ""'plan',"", ""'rail',"", ""'journey',"", ""'present',"", ""'lners',"", ""'service',"", ""'reduce',"", ""'package',"", ""'sweet',"", ""'savoury',"", ""'snack',"", ""'hot',"", ""'cold',"", ""'drink',"", ""'hot',"", ""'toastie',"", ""'content',"", ""'time',"", ""'day',"", ""'lner',"", ""'resume',"", ""'trolley',"", ""'service',"", ""'passengers',"", ""'seat',"", ""'may',"", ""'usual',"", ""'multiple',"", ""'drink',"", ""'snack',"", ""'cater',"", ""'supplier',"", ""'hasnt',"", ""'biscuits',"", ""'cake',"", ""'slice',"", ""'quite',"", ""'good',"", ""'wish',"", ""'book',"", ""'rail',"", ""'ticket',"", ""'ginger',"", ""'cake',"", ""'slice',"", ""'plan',"", ""'travel',"", ""'service',"", ""'pre',"", ""'pandemic',"", ""'ticket',"", ""'visit',"", ""'lounge',"", ""'edinburgh',"", ""'waverley',"", ""'cup',"", ""'tea',"", ""'biscuits',"", ""'way',"", ""'start',"", ""'trip',"", ""'fastest',"", ""'train',"", ""'alnmouth',"", ""'hour',"", ""'may',"", ""'short',"", ""'trip',"", ""'hot',"", ""'meal',"", ""'time',"", ""'standard',"", ""'fine',"", ""'trip',"", ""'waverley',"", ""'station',"", ""'experience',"", ""'short',"", ""'trip',"", ""'seat',"", ""'2',"", ""'1',"", ""'2',"", ""'2',"", ""'pitch',"", ""'row',"", ""'quieter',"", ""'carriage',"", ""'book',"", ""'ticket',"", ""'may',"", ""'many',"", ""'months']""]",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

therefore, *if* the games go on, there might not be full athlete participation, especially in some of the sports where professionals consider a medal just an icing on the cake. they could still allow spectators but japanese only and in limited capacity (like npb did in 2020). international tourists might still be banned.
overall, i think a decision won't be made until the spring comes. the winter wave was always expected. if the numbers don't find a way to go down domestically, then i could see them putting the brakes on.
to a certain extent, i think japan isn't combating the pandemic correctly. quarantine is still not strict. a person i know who is married to a japanese woman recently flew to osaka. he taxied to a pension but he did say he was allowed to leave and buy take-out. any interaction is just not a good idea. they should follow the south korea/new zealand model where folks arriving must be booked into a designated hotel. all meals are to be provided, etc.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g298184-i861-k13462227-80_favor_for_Olympics_cancel_and_postpone-Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html,80 % favor for Olympics cancel and postpone,SammyFD,HK,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SammyFD?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,50,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,50,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,50.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,50.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,50,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,50,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,200,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,35000,"[""['see',"", ""'game',"", ""'happen',"", ""'extend',"", ""'quarantine',"", ""'test',"", ""'require',"", ""'athletes',"", ""'officials',"", ""'refer',"", ""'australian',"", ""'open',"", ""'tennis',"", ""'tournament',"", ""'due',"", ""'strict',"", ""'quarantine',"", ""'regulations',"", ""'roger',"", ""'federer',"", ""'play',"", ""'alone',"", ""'spend',"", ""'5',"", ""'weeks',"", ""'away',"", ""'family',"", ""'family',"", ""'stick',"", ""'hotel',"", ""'room',"", ""'long',"", ""'stay',"", ""'tournament',"", ""'therefore',"", ""'game',"", ""'full',"", ""'athlete',"", ""'participation',"", ""'sport',"", ""'professionals',"", ""'medal',"", ""'ice',"", ""'cake',"", ""'allow',"", ""'spectators',"", ""'japanese',"", ""'limit',"", ""'capacity',"", ""'npb',"", ""'2020',"", ""'international',"", ""'tourists',"", ""'ban',"", ""'overall',"", ""'decision',"", ""'spring',"", ""'winter',"", ""'wave',"", ""'expect',"", ""'number',"", ""'way',"", ""'domestically',"", ""'see',"", ""'brake',"", ""'certain',"", ""'extent',"", ""'japan',"", ""'isnt',"", ""'combat',"", ""'pandemic',"", ""'correctly',"", ""'quarantine',"", ""'strict',"", ""'person',"", ""'marry',"", ""'japanese',"", ""'woman',"", ""'recently',"", ""'fly',"", ""'osaka',"", ""'taxi',"", ""'pension',"", ""'allow',"", ""'buy',"", ""'interaction',"", ""'good',"", ""'idea',"", ""'south',"", ""'korea',"", ""'new',"", ""'zealand',"", ""'model',"", ""'folks',"", ""'arrive',"", ""'must',"", ""'book',"", ""'designate',"", ""'hotel',"", ""'meals',"", ""'provide']""]",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

john","for festivities (parties, drink and dance) and decorations, saigon takes the cake for both christmas and new year's eve.
if you want something more intimate, try đà lạt in the central highlands. it's also cooler so you'll see the locals dressed more to the season. (note that the locals in general do not tolerate the cold as well as westerners.) the daily temperature there is normally 55-70f, but they'll be dressing like it's 40-55f.
another thing to look for is the da lat flower festival. they don't have a fixed period of time for it, but it's between 4 to 7 days.
it may start before christmas, after christmas, or even after new year; you'll just have to check on it.
hanoi has its own christmas flavor, somewhere in between, and it's almost as cool as đà lạt at that time of the year.
if you want to try something different, try either nam định or thái bình province. they have the largest concentration of churches in the country in a smaller area. best to ride a motorbike/pillion for this option since you'd want to check out several small towns and villages on this trip. these provinces are located in the red river delta to the southeast of hà nội so the difference in temperature is usually a few degrees.

edited: 4:51 am, march 27,","kintamani is a large area so perhaps if you let us know where you will stay perhaps people can better advise. some hotels will do a birthday cake for you. somebody may know the hotel you intend to stay.
perhaps you could also let people know when you are going and your itinerary before kintamani. it might also be possible to pick one up before you go
we are usually in bali on my wifes birthday. in some hotels we have stayed it has been easy to arrange a cake. at the discovery in kuta they actually did it without asking. came back after a day out to find a birthday cake in the room.
one year i baked a carrot cake for my wifes birthday and brought it with me to amed. she didn’t know about it but then again she doesn’t check my luggage (and i don’t check hers) and my bag is a dive bag full of dive gear so easy to hide.

can you list names of hotels and resorts which offer rooms, suites, or villas designed specifically for honeymooners as accommodation type?
that would include: - special welcome - beach dinner - cake sometimes - private pool designed - some activities in the resort ... etc..
