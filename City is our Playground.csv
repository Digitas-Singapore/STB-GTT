thanks advance ","hi folks,
i'm planning a visit in march/april next year which will finish with 4 nights in phuket where we fly home from. we are a family of 4 with kids aged 6 and 8. we'll spend 4/5 nights in bangkok, a few in khao sok, then 6 nights each in krabi railay and phi phi.
i'd like something special for the last 4 nights in phuket but also to keep the kids happy. budget is €150-€350 per night.
my criteria (in order of preference) is:
1. nice ambience in resort and surrounding area (trees, soft lighting etc. not concrete jungle)
2. walking distance to some amenities, mini market, local restaurants etc.
3. good kids pool scene and maybe kids club
we will have done a lot of beach stuff already so beachfront or seaview isn't a dealbreaker. we'll laze around the resort mostly and maybe do a day trip to theme park and one evening to see the bright lights of patong if suitable with kids.
i've done a lot of research and looked on maps narrowing down to the following list:
dusit thani laguna
centara grand karon
katathani beach resort
the baray villa
any advice from folks who have stayed one or some of these properties would be much appreciated. what i'm really trying to get a sense of is the 'feeling of a place' i've also looked at youtube videos of locations etc which leads me mostly towards dusit thani or baray villa.

for me the pig and fiddle is aimed at the yoof market - which may include you !",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g186370-i379-k13507055-Sunday_roast_with_plant_based_options-Bath_Somerset_England.html,Sunday roast with plant based options,RomanCitizen,EU,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RomanCitizen?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,50,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,50,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,50,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,200,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,50,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,50,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,32500,"[""['hugely',"", ""'open',"", ""'covid',"", ""'hare',"", ""'hound',"", ""'way',"", ""'town',"", ""'motorway',"", ""'time',"", ""'city',"", ""'food',"", ""'good',"", ""'place',"", ""'include',"", ""'hop',"", ""'pole',"", ""'marlborough',"", ""'tavern',"", ""'chequer',"", ""'bath',"", ""'brewhouse',"", ""'king',"", ""'william',"", ""'plus',"", ""'restaurants',"", ""'woods',"", ""'abbey',"", ""'hotel',"", ""'kitchen',"", ""'place',"", ""'reservation',"", ""'specify',"", ""'sunday',"", ""'lunch',"", ""'case',"", ""'pig',"", ""'fiddle',"", ""'aim',"", ""'yoof',"", ""'market',"", ""'may',"", ""'include']""]",False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

the conrad is an excellent hotel if not a tad business orientated, as lovely as it is there’s not a lot going on to keep teens occupied.
dubai mall isn’t really within walking distance and it’s still a taxi ride or metro ( a bit of a walk from the metro but easy enough).
jbr/marina is closer to the theme parks and easy enough to get to atlantis but there’s also a lot more choice for restaurants and the area is lively enough to keep them occupied.
sheikh zayed rd is more central for getting about dubai, there’s plenty of cafes and fast food places nearby but they’re a bit more spread out than and you might be more dependent on taxis to head to elsewhere in the evening.
i honestly think a 1 bed at grosvenor house would tick all of your boxes and it’s half board is excellent. if it’s way over budget then i’d still be inclined to look for another apartment in this area.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g295424-i872-k13645922-Hotel_and_area_advice_for_family_of_5_visiting_in_April-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html,Hotel and area advice for family of 5 visiting in April,hannahengland,UK,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hannahengland?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,200,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,50,0,50,0,0,0,0,0.0,50,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,200,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,50,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,50,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,50,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,55000,"[""['personally',"", ""'3',"", ""'teenage',"", ""'girls',"", ""'jbr',"", ""'marina',"", ""'area',"", ""'suit',"", ""'much',"", ""'conrad',"", ""'excellent',"", ""'hotel',"", ""'tad',"", ""'business',"", ""'orientate',"", ""'there’s',"", ""'lot',"", ""'keep',"", ""'teens',"", ""'occupy',"", ""'dubai',"", ""'mall',"", ""'isn’t',"", ""'walk',"", ""'distance',"", ""'it’s',"", ""'taxi',"", ""'ride',"", ""'metro',"", ""'walk',"", ""'metro',"", ""'easy',"", ""'jbr',"", ""'marina',"", ""'closer',"", ""'theme',"", ""'park',"", ""'easy',"", ""'atlantis',"", ""'there’s',"", ""'lot',"", ""'choice',"", ""'restaurants',"", ""'area',"", ""'lively',"", ""'keep',"", ""'occupy',"", ""'sheikh',"", ""'zayed',"", ""'rd',"", ""'central',"", ""'dubai',"", ""'there’s',"", ""'plenty',"", ""'cafes',"", ""'fast',"", ""'food',"", ""'place',"", ""'nearby',"", ""'they’re',"", ""'spread',"", ""'dependent',"", ""'taxis',"", ""'head',"", ""'elsewhere',"", ""'honestly',"", ""'1',"", ""'bed',"", ""'grosvenor',"", ""'house',"", ""'tick',"", ""'box',"", ""'it’s',"", ""'half',"", ""'board',"", ""'excellent',"", ""'it’s',"", ""'way',"", ""'budget',"", ""'i’d',"", ""'incline',"", ""'apartment',"", ""'area']""]",False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

dubai (and uae) place kids. there's much much eat family friendly. loved there! ","we have had a wonderful 5 months in the uae (myself and my two younger kids) and i wanted to share some of my favorite things we did which aren't always on the top of all of the lists. of course we loved the burj khalifa, wild wadi, etc, but there are a lot of other great things to do in dubai which are lower in cost and more ""local"" which are very memorable. many of them are much easier with a car. here are some of them, not in any particular order: 
1. boats, markets and museums on a historical creek day: there is so much to see on the creek if you are a fan of walking and boating. you can easily plan a trip combining little 1aed abra boats with ferries and walking. we started at baniyas, walked up to the souks, crossed to the other souks on the other side (a good time for side trip to some of the museums there), and walked all of the way down through the markets, crossing back over to baniyas where the canopy by hilton is. staying at the canopy by hilton, or the curio hotel there or the sheraton on the creek is a perfect way to do it. 
2. lovely beaches, playgrounds and walking at al mamzar beach park: this is truly a hidden gem with long walks and pretty beach coves, endless playgrounds and places to grill and fly a kite. it's spotless and they do charge a 5aed admission which is well spent for all of the facilities. if you look online you can see the endless stretches of sand on both side of the park. the water was clean and clear when we were there and the sand softer than much of dubai.
  3. culture and beauty in sharjah: we did this trip a number of times. we would head up to the museum of islamic civilization for a 30-40 minute visit (if you like science, it's fascinating and my kids also liked it, but it's not interactive), from there, if you have plenty of time stop into the fish market, which is just amazing. head along to the al noor mosque and park there. it's ideal to arrive around an hour or so before sunset so you can see lovely al noor island lit up after dark as well. wander over to al noor island and explore the paths and gardens, sculptures, reading pavilion and ropes course (there is an admission fee). after, walk back over the bridge and head to the right, walking along the bay, to the al majaz waterfront. we liked the playground there and eating at al fanar, the emirati restaurant. lovely on cool nights on the water as they provide blankets. 
4. laser light show and festivities at festival city: i can't remember how many times we did this, but it was a ta friend on the forums who suggested it. it's such a fun mall, and, while we saw all of the fountain shows in dubai this was by far our favorite. especially because every show is different all evening, so you can make a whole night of it. it's stunning with the lasers and the lights and water -- and it's also free. something is always happening at this fun mall -- one festival or another, and they are all great. the holiday inn at festival city is truly a hidden gem. it's lovely, with spacious modern rooms, a fantastic staff, and kids eat free at their excellent healthy restaurant. we kept going back and the kids say it's their #1 place to stay in dubai (against a lof of competition of places which are 5x-7x the price, so there you have it). 
6. getting super posh at versace (not a cheap day): another place we all returned to again and again! if your kids can roll with a more subdued and upscale environment, versace has a dedicated family pool which is gorgeous and warm and excellent food and service. versace china poolside? yes, please. big fluffly towels, great kids menu and a pretty garden and none of the crowds you experience on the palm (but also no beach, but we never missed it). your entrance fee is a little steep but it's 100% redeemable for food and drink and well worth it if you fancy a fancy day with the kiddos. 
dubai (and all of the uae) is a great place for kids. there's so much to do and so much to eat and it's all family friendly. we loved it there!

edited: 11:45 am, june 05,","ive travelled all over and also was in phoneix one year in early august , phoneix and vegas were scorching hot but did not have the humidity that dubai has , so im just saying maybe take it a tad easily a bit in the day .
we walked with ease the vegas strip at midday and whilst phoenix was hotter it was manageable and we could eat outside with some degree of comfort , although most places did have misters .
no chance of that in dubai, its just to hot.
hotter than than and more uncomfortable would be singapore. ive never found the states that hot at that time ever.
a lot can be achieved in doors and early pm . dubai mall is really lovely in the pm so you could do burj khallifa before it gets dark then move on to the mall /fountains etc. its a huge mall with some highly expensive shops .
mall of the emirates is pretty standard now , but worth a trip if you want to ski at ski dubai.
atlantis and jumeriah beach are nice .
marina more for the late pm with the bars and restaurants - maybe do yellow boats tour but prob best when it is a bit cooler ie late pm.
i would say the theme parks are not as good as the states . ferrari world i thought was a bit to educational but it draws in people for that big ride. never done img i think a lot is indoors as well.

dli_nk - thank you for sharing stunning fall photos.
william512 - also enjoyed your pictures. sakura bloom shots were wonderful, and your flower field pictures inspired me to add the two locations to our trip!
global1715255 - i thought your link to the intro to kabuki was helpful, and will get my husband to watch it before the trip. on your suggestion, i also added an overnight stay at ine fishing village.
hfot2 - my husband and i love easy, scenic bike rides like the kibi plain trail. in okayama, can korakuen gardens and kurashiki visit be combined in one day (mar 29) without overdoing it? if yes, we can then do the bike ride on mar 30, so we can take as much time as we want on the ride. the only other thing we are doing that day is driving to iya valley in late afternoon.
after more research i decided to forego the noto peninsula days, primarily because its not the right time to see the rice fields (flooded in late apr), and i really like the idea of overnighting in ine. i also spent time reading about shikoku. it was hard to decide what to see and what to leave out. i found that the matsuyama spring festival may happen while we are there, so focused on that area and iya valley. here's the latest itinerary version, with more detail added. still need to fill in tokyo, and then work on hotel/travel details.
mar 24 (thu) depart us
mar 26 arrive osaka from us.
mar 26-28 osaka (2 nts)
mar 26 visit kuromon ichiba market (energetic and fun food market), ebisu-bashi bridge (very crowded, iconic picture), nishinomaru garden (cherry blossoms), dotonburi food tour in evening.
mar 27 sumo tournament with guide in edion arena, osaka (this is last day of tournament, expect tickets to be hard to get, advanced tickets on sale beginning feb 6, 2022). go with guide to explain matches, request chair seats, second floor in section a, pref. first row on inner end.

i short changed tokyo. tokyo comes end long trip, week longer usual, i've limited number days tokyo 2. let improve days.
edited: 3:39 pm, january 07,","dli_hk - thank you for your comments. with those in mind, i've changed the apr 1-4 schedule by taking a night from matsuyama and adding a night in takamatsu:
apr 1 drive from iya valley to matsuyama (2 hrs)
apr 1-3 matsuyama (2 nts)
apr 1 (fri) depending on activities and arrival time in matsuyama, may spend some time at spring festival (held every first weekend in april from fri to sun)
apr 2 (sat) if missed festival on apr 1, spend some time enjoying this morning before day tour. guided day trip: uchiko village (48 min drive from matsuyama, visit streets in yokaichi-gokoku areas) and ozu village (20 min from uichiko). uchiko is charming, but so is ozu. ozu has a nice (reconstructed) castle, a small 'old town', a tea house in a tree house and a lighthouse for ghosts. drive to shikoku karst then head back to matsuyama.
apr 4 drive from matsuyama to takamatsu (2 hrs). enroute stop at shiudeyama in mitoyo (beautiful view of 1000 sakura trees overlooking seto inland sea), and at goshiki-dai, “five-colored” plateau in sakaide with nice views of seto-inland sea and the seto-ohashi connecting to okayama.
apr 4-5 takamatsu (i nt)
apr 5 guided tour of ritsurin gardens (a must see beautiful, old style garden – one of best in japan) for a 3-4 hrs or more depending on interest, then have a lunch of udon noodles. there is a nice tea house overlooking the gardens for lunch. after lunch, transit to kyoto (drive 3 hrs or train 2 hrs) with stop at akashi kaikyo national government park (beautiful park with fields of tulips and other spring flowers).
is that better/less rushed?
i've been working on our 2 days in tokyo and have come up with the following:
apr 16-19 tokyo (3 nts)
apr 17 guided tour of tokyo west:
shibuya. experience shibuya district’s neon lights, trendy japanese teens in wild outfits, huge department stores and crowds. shibuya crossing is the “busiest intersection in the world”. a bit touristy, but stop by
hachiko statue erected in memory of dog named hachiko. shibuya itself is the sight to see;
harajuku. walk around harajuku, an internationally renowned fashion district, that is famous for defiantly bold styles and outlandish food trends, its streets acting as fashion runways. 15 min walk from shibuya.
takeshita-dori is harajuku’s most famous street.
shinjuku. shinjuku is known as large entertainment, business and shopping area. in this district you can also find the famous golden gai, a large collection of (really) small bars and restaurants in different alleys.
get a perspective on tokyo’s sheer size from tokyo skytree before sun set;
watch the show at the robot restaurant (temporarily closed). spectacular, high-tech laser displays, multi-coloured lights, flash dances, glittering robots. one of a kind show. reserve tickets in advance. show up about 45 min before show time. have dinner somewhere else.
18 (mon) guided tour of tokyo east:
toyosu market (tuna auction). auction takes place from about 5:30 – 6:30 am. can watch from upper-floor observation deck (opens to visitors at 5 am, arrive early because if crowded may not be able to see much) or special deck on lower floor (request tickets in advance for time slot from 5:55 am to 6:25 am, not a guarantee).
tsukiji fish market. the market opens to the public at 9 am and is extremely crowded. most of market activity ends by 11 am. arrive just before market opens to avoid worst of the crowds.
asakusa. browse around asakusa to uncover tokyo’s best preserved traditional japanese architecture;
tokyo national museum. guided tour of museum highlights for a couple of hrs.
visit imperial palace east garden.
apr 18 fly from tokyo to us
i know that i have short changed tokyo. tokyo comes at the end of a long trip, that is about a week longer than our usual, so i've limited the number of days in tokyo to 2. please let me know how to improve these days.

you’re moving around a lot; unpacking, packing, travelling. you’ll lose time with all the transfers. are you travelling with suitcases? you could leave your main luggage with your ubud accommodation and just have hand luggage for your island trips.
as suggested perhaps you could consider sanur for the last leg. there are cooking classes available. (i did my cooking class with janet de neefe of casa luna/indus fame in ubud which was excellent).
sanur has a lovely beachfront pathway with cafes, restaurants, markets. the main road, jalan danau tamblingan, has cafes, restaurants, bakeries, supermarket, shops. cycling is popular in sanur. beach is child friendly. you might enjoy a prahu boat ride. approximately half an hour to airport.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g294226-i7220-k13599665-2022_back_to_the_drawing_board-Bali.html,2022 - back to the drawing board,baliAustralia,AU,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/baliAustralia?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,100,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,100,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,100,0,400,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,100,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,60000,"[""['hundreds',"", ""'travellers',"", ""'depart',"", ""'ubud',"", ""'ngurah',"", ""'rai',"", ""'airport',"", ""'keep',"", ""'mind',"", ""'time',"", ""'ubud',"", ""'accommodation',"", ""'flight',"", ""'departure',"", ""'time',"", ""'you’ll',"", ""'distance',"", ""'ubud',"", ""'arrival',"", ""'bali',"", ""'you’ve',"", ""'6',"", ""'nights',"", ""'ubud',"", ""'there’s',"", ""'time',"", ""'cook',"", ""'class',"", ""'shop',"", ""'ubud',"", ""'brilliant',"", ""'children',"", ""'may',"", ""'pondok',"", ""'pekak',"", ""'library',"", ""'learn',"", ""'centre',"", ""'ubud',"", ""'activities',"", ""'eg',"", ""'balinese',"", ""'dance',"", ""'gamelan',"", ""'wood',"", ""'carve',"", ""'fruit',"", ""'carve',"", ""'balinese',"", ""'silver',"", ""'jewellery',"", ""'balinese',"", ""'modern',"", ""'paint',"", ""'you’re',"", ""'move',"", ""'lot',"", ""'unpack',"", ""'pack',"", ""'travel',"", ""'you’ll',"", ""'lose',"", ""'time',"", ""'transfer',"", ""'travel',"", ""'suitcases',"", ""'main',"", ""'luggage',"", ""'ubud',"", ""'accommodation',"", ""'hand',"", ""'luggage',"", ""'island',"", ""'trip',"", ""'sanur',"", ""'leg',"", ""'cook',"", ""'class',"", ""'cook',"", ""'class',"", ""'janet',"", ""'de',"", ""'neefe',"", ""'casa',"", ""'luna',"", ""'indus',"", ""'fame',"", ""'ubud',"", ""'excellent',"", ""'sanur',"", ""'beachfront',"", ""'pathway',"", ""'cafes',"", ""'restaurants',"", ""'market',"", ""'main',"", ""'road',"", ""'jalan',"", ""'danau',"", ""'tamblingan',"", ""'cafes',"", ""'restaurants',"", ""'bakeries',"", ""'supermarket',"", ""'shop',"", ""'cycle',"", ""'popular',"", ""'sanur',"", ""'beach',"", ""'child',"", ""'friendly',"", ""'prahu',"", ""'boat',"", ""'ride',"", ""'approximately',"", ""'half',"", ""'hour',"", ""'airport']""]",False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
29,1981,ID,"hi, informative knowledgeable information ta members. personal suggestion arrange airport pickup ta member’s suggestion driver; preferably driver based ubud. find driver compatible engage day's sightseeing afield base ubud. and, personally, never self drive bali.
it important you’re aware ubud locations mentioned post#2. walkable sites ubud central. e.g. puri lukisan museum, antonio blanco museum, ubud palace, ubud market, saraswati temple, monkey forest, camphuan ridge walk. loads cafes, restaurants many cuisine choices prices suit budgets.
as you’ve noted taxis/uber allowed ubud and, personally, private drivers expensive short trips ubud. staying check see accommodation offers complimentary shuttle service ubud centre check schedule.
then driver transfer seminyak (with sightseeing way wanted). seminyak bluebird taxis plentiful economical.
we flight bookings, accommodation ourselves; travel agents. booking.com choose “free cancellation” option accommodation. site filter, room photos, hotel facilities, reviews, location map. necessarily overview. seminyak consider jalan kayu aya (“eat street”) “central. plenty beach clubs seminyak/canggu. taxis/uber canggu. i’m fan airbnb.
bali currently open tourists need aware protocols open. perhaps read jacki pomeroy’s covid-19 update fb. “rules” constantly changing it’s indonesian government makes decisions, bali governor.
cheers.","hi, very informative and knowledgeable information from the above ta members. my personal suggestion is to arrange an airport pickup from a ta member’s suggestion for a driver; preferably a driver based in ubud. if you find this driver compatible you would engage him for your day's sightseeing further afield from your base in ubud. and, again personally, i would never self drive in bali.
it is important that you’re aware of ubud locations as mentioned in post#2. there are some walkable sites in ubud central. e.g. puri lukisan museum, antonio blanco museum, ubud palace, ubud market, saraswati temple, monkey forest, camphuan ridge walk. loads of cafes, restaurants with many cuisine choices and prices to suit all budgets.
as you’ve noted there are no taxis/uber allowed in ubud and, for me personally, private drivers are expensive for short trips around ubud. if staying further out check to see if the accommodation offers a complimentary shuttle service to ubud centre and check the schedule.
then you can use the same driver for your transfer to seminyak (with sightseeing on the way if wanted). in seminyak bluebird taxis are plentiful and economical.
we do all our flight bookings, accommodation ourselves; no travel agents. we use booking.com and choose the “free cancellation” option for accommodation. on their site there is a filter, room photos, hotel facilities, reviews, location map. not necessarily to use them but will give you an overview. in seminyak i consider jalan kayu aya (“eat street”) to be “central. plenty of beach clubs in seminyak/canggu. no taxis/uber in canggu. i’m not a fan of airbnb.
bali is currently not open to tourists and you need to be aware of the protocols if and when it may open. perhaps read jacki pomeroy’s covid-19 update on fb. the “rules” are constantly changing and it’s the indonesian government who makes the decisions, not the bali governor.

you arrange snorkeling trips locally involve road trip minibus picking local boat.
out main singaraja road find restaurants geared tourists. particularly warung tirta sari tirta sari bungalows opposite suka sari bungalows warung.
also nearby selini bakery nice cakes.","hi,
first to note to avoid any confusion that the kembali villas you listed in post #3 (perhaps it was an auto link) is not kembali beach bungalows in amed.
kembali villas linked in post #3 are in seminyak.
do you dive or just snorkeling.
pemuteran
check exact location of any property carefully. pemuteran spreads out a long way also inland.
pemuteran is mrs pigs favourite after amed.
we stay at 
you have to walk down the beach a little to enter the sea for snorkeling. main reasons is that their are a lot of sea urchins in the sea along with low lying reefs close to shore. there is a signpost.
entry is more or less in front of the pondok sari.
you will also find the biorock reef restoration project.
the only thing is that pemuteran bay is very sandy (just offshore). at full moon/spring tides/windy/choppy seas the sand can get churned up in the bay. even snorkeling close to shore it can be like snorkeling in a milkshake. literally can’t see your hand in front of your face. biorock not visible.
i’ve been diving well offshore and when in shallower water 10-15m on a sunny day it was like diving in a snowglobe with all the glistening sand.
i use the dive centre on the beach behind the swimming pool/wellness massage centre.

they have 2 dive boats. one rib and one larger fibreglass hull boat.
if only snorkeling you can enquire at the dive centre or others along the beach, about snorkeling trips menjangan.
dive trips often willing to take snorkelers if space. advantage is the boat goes from the beach.

1. restaurants potentially fine dining options - don’t mind paying the money if the quality & service is good - having said that some of the most memorable meals we’ve had have come from small independent family businesses where recipes are passed down through generations. so the food is the top priority.
2. gastro pubs for leisurely lunches & people watching.
3. nice places to stop for a cuppa & slice of something indulgent after a day on your feet walking.
so far i’ve looked at booking an evening river trip with drinks and a meal at the folly (they do it as a package)
we plan to do a walking tour of the city (recommendations on this welcome) on the morning of our first day & i definitely want to book a guided tour of bodleian library. we plan on visiting the castle & prison. i love architecture, photography (not selfies) jazz & anything vintage.
we have separate day trips outside of these three nights for blenheim palace and a visit to moreton in marsh.
any recommendations or suggestions would be 100% appreciated. thank you.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g186361-i440-k13554598-Romantic_3_Night_Celebration_in_Oxford_Activities_Dining-Oxford_Oxfordshire_England.html,Romantic 3 Night Celebration in Oxford Activities & Dining,Boho1979,"Deal, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Boho1979?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,50,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,200,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,50,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,50,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,50,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,50,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,50,0,200,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,200,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,50,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,200,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,50,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,100000,"[""['hello',"", ""'many',"", ""'overseas',"", ""'holiday',"", ""'cancellations',"", ""'book',"", ""'staycation',"", ""'include',"", ""'3',"", ""'nights',"", ""'old',"", ""'bank',"", ""'hotel',"", ""'end',"", ""'july',"", ""'cover',"", ""'hubbies',"", ""'birthday',"", ""'wed',"", ""'anniversary',"", ""'process',"", ""'plan',"", ""'recommendations',"", ""'1',"", ""'restaurants',"", ""'potentially',"", ""'fine',"", ""'din',"", ""'options',"", ""'don’t',"", ""'mind',"", ""'pay',"", ""'money',"", ""'quality',"", ""'service',"", ""'good',"", ""'memorable',"", ""'meals',"", ""'we’ve',"", ""'small',"", ""'independent',"", ""'family',"", ""'businesses',"", ""'recipes',"", ""'pass',"", ""'generations',"", ""'food',"", ""'top',"", ""'priority',"", ""'2',"", ""'gastro',"", ""'pubs',"", ""'leisurely',"", ""'lunch',"", ""'people',"", ""'watch',"", ""'3',"", ""'place',"", ""'stop',"", ""'cuppa',"", ""'slice',"", ""'something',"", ""'indulgent',"", ""'day',"", ""'feet',"", ""'walk',"", ""'far',"", ""'i’ve',"", ""'book',"", ""'river',"", ""'trip',"", ""'drink',"", ""'meal',"", ""'folly',"", ""'package',"", ""'plan',"", ""'walk',"", ""'tour',"", ""'city',"", ""'recommendations',"", ""'welcome',"", ""'morning',"", ""'day',"", ""'book',"", ""'guide',"", ""'tour',"", ""'bodleian',"", ""'library',"", ""'plan',"", ""'visit',"", ""'castle',"", ""'prison',"", ""'architecture',"", ""'photography',"", ""'selfies',"", ""'jazz',"", ""'vintage',"", ""'separate',"", ""'day',"", ""'trip',"", ""'outside',"", ""'three',"", ""'nights',"", ""'blenheim',"", ""'palace',"", ""'visit',"", ""'moreton',"", ""'marsh',"", ""'recommendations',"", ""'suggestions',"", ""'100']""]",False,False,True,True,False,True,False,False,True,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

then there are the parks and markets to explore as there's far more to london than museums! i'm not personally keen on the london eye but each to their own. i prefer a river trip down to north greenwich, a ride on the emirates cable car and back to london on the dlr. i think these all give a different perspective of the city.
pub wise, two of my favourites are close together, at the two ends of blackfriars bridge. doggett's is at the south with a separate restaurant area overlooking the river, and the black friar is at the north end. that one is a beautiful historical old pub which usually has a very good selection of cask ales to try.

more of a proper but planned village of course and in a more restrained classical style, mixed with traditional architecture but you can see some of his signature touches in the place.
i remember a good pub/inn and nice walks/river/coast around the place plus a first class campsite.

2-3 nights in neil island
1 day for baratang
3-4 nights for north andaman - ross & smith, 1 full day for saddle peak trek, aam kunj beach etc
there is another great option - if so much of travel is not for you - spend a week in havelock in a resort either on the radhanagar or vijaynagar beaches and about 5 nights in the neil islands and just the night of arrival and night before departure in port blair town!

another female docent, tall, thin, sporty short haircut, encouraged buy guidebook (which did) helpful. many thanks her.
it miserable day--chilly pouring rain. chipper younger woman entrance pointed river path bridge, i'm glad did; wonderful (although chilly) walk.
i arrived train london; bus runs cathedral every 15 minutes so. many thanks women working station day pointed right direction catch bus.
the bus driver nice friendly. asset durham i'm sorry note name.

thank you, durham, preserving amazing unesco world heritage site welcoming people graciously kindly. graciousness kindness remember. lasagna. :)","i went to durham to see the cathedral on tuesday, july 6, and i wanted to share my experience with other would-be travelers.
-book the guided tour in advance. it was sold out for the day i went, and i had been waiting many years to visit the cathedral (romanesque architecture is my absolute favorite). it did not even occur to me that i needed to book many days in advance. i honestly thought i would cry when they kindly said it was sold out*. i texted my children and husband; my husband offered to try to find me a private tour guide immediately, but there was not way that could have worked out. very sweet of him, though.
-tour groups are currently limited to 5 or 6 ppl total. i was confused bc there was at least 1 large school group there on that day; many more than 5-6 ppl. i realize the rules come from the uk govt, not the cathedral. i realize that the cathedral is doing its best to follow what seem to be confusing rules (a big school group = ok, +6 adults in a tour group = not ok). it is what it is--just know them before you go.
-reserve a table in the cafe if you think you might eat there, or eat after 2pm.
*i did not cry, although i may never get to go to durham again (i live in tx), because of the volunteers at the cathedral. i would especially like to highlight hazel, a docent who was so helpful. she was like an angel. she answered my many questions in great detail and was the best of the british--kind, knowledgeable, and with a reserve that comes from a deep well of very good manners. she made me feel i could ask as many questions as i wanted to.
another female docent, tall, thin, with a sporty short haircut, encouraged me to buy a guidebook (which i did) and it was so helpful. many thanks to her.
it was a miserable day--chilly and pouring rain. a chipper younger woman at the entrance pointed out the river path to the bridge, and i'm so glad she did; it was a wonderful (although chilly) walk.
i arrived on a train from london; there is a bus that runs you to the cathedral every 15 minutes or so. many thanks to the women working in the station that day who pointed me in the right direction to catch the bus.
the bus driver was so nice and friendly. such an asset to durham and i'm sorry i did not make note of his name.
i had not eaten all day and, after seeing most of the cathedral, i went down to the cafe on a chance; there was 1 unreserved table at 2:15 (the guided tour started at 2). the women working in the cafe were very helpful. i had the lasagna special (lasagna, bread, and a salad) and a giant (hot and cozy) latte. my lunch was delicious and perfect for the weather.
there was a young, young woman in the gift shop; she was precious and sweet. the shop has a very good book on the architecture of the cathedral which i have been reading.
i wandered around the immediate area before catching the bus back to the train station and back to london. 6 hours on a train; 3 hours in durham.
all of the people i have referenced were at their posts after 12:20 on july 6. they deserve recognition. if there is any way to forward my thanks to them, please let me know.
the cathedral is exceptional and durham, even in the pouring rain, was charming. it was well worth the 3 hours there and 3 hours back on the train.
thank you, durham, for preserving this amazing unesco world heritage site and welcoming people so graciously and kindly. it's the graciousness and kindness i will most remember. and the lasagna.

water sports booked spot - scuba day earlier preferably","radhanagar beach is famous for its pristine sands and sunset - an afternoon - say from 3pm to 5.30 pm till the sunsets is enough - though i felt it is worth at least 4-5 hours (for your kid to play and you folks to enjoy!) do not rush!
we skipped scuba and did seawalking in havelock and glass boat ride / snorkeling in neil (off bharatpur beach) and enjoyed both. it depends on the time you have in hand in either place. scuba - many prefer havelock.
the key deciding factor on when to go for undersea activity: the weather on a given day for high under water visibility - my suggestion if an earlier day has sunny bright weather devoid of clouds, go. do not wait for the location - you are on a short tight schedule and you cant do it over again!
if you go by makruzz the actual travel time is about 90 minutes pb - hl. hl-nl and nl to pb should be about 60+ mins. government ferries take much longer. the check in process is more complex now and may need you to report 90-120 minutes earlier depending on the current regulations - security checks, checking in, verification of covid negative report, handing over baggage.
collecting baggage on arrival would take another 30 mins.- it was a chaotic process.
you can book sound and light show online - some museums also i guess - checkout what is available to pre-book

water sports can be booked on the spot - scuba one day earlier preferably",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g297583-i9941-k13479495-Itinerary_for_6D_in_Andaman_and_Nicobar-Andaman_and_Nicobar_Islands.html,Itinerary for 6D in Andaman and Nicobar,ravi_vee,Galaxy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ravi_vee?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,50,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,50,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,50,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,50,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,50,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,200,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,200,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,52500,"[""['radhanagar',"", ""'beach',"", ""'famous',"", ""'pristine',"", ""'sand',"", ""'sunset',"", ""'afternoon',"", ""'3pm',"", ""'530',"", ""'till',"", ""'sunsets',"", ""'felt',"", ""'worth',"", ""'least',"", ""'4',"", ""'5',"", ""'hours',"", ""'kid',"", ""'play',"", ""'folks',"", ""'rush',"", ""'skip',"", ""'scuba',"", ""'seawalking',"", ""'havelock',"", ""'glass',"", ""'boat',"", ""'ride',"", ""'snorkel',"", ""'neil',"", ""'bharatpur',"", ""'beach',"", ""'time',"", ""'hand',"", ""'place',"", ""'scuba',"", ""'many',"", ""'prefer',"", ""'havelock',"", ""'key',"", ""'factor',"", ""'undersea',"", ""'activity',"", ""'weather',"", ""'day',"", ""'high',"", ""'water',"", ""'visibility',"", ""'suggestion',"", ""'earlier',"", ""'day',"", ""'sunny',"", ""'bright',"", ""'weather',"", ""'devoid',"", ""'cloud',"", ""'wait',"", ""'location',"", ""'short',"", ""'tight',"", ""'schedule',"", ""'makruzz',"", ""'actual',"", ""'travel',"", ""'time',"", ""'90',"", ""'minutes',"", ""'pb',"", ""'hl',"", ""'hl',"", ""'nl',"", ""'nl',"", ""'pb',"", ""'60',"", ""'mins',"", ""'government',"", ""'ferry',"", ""'much',"", ""'longer',"", ""'process',"", ""'complex',"", ""'may',"", ""'report',"", ""'90',"", ""'120',"", ""'minutes',"", ""'earlier',"", ""'current',"", ""'regulations',"", ""'security',"", ""'verification',"", ""'covid',"", ""'negative',"", ""'report',"", ""'hand',"", ""'baggage',"", ""'collect',"", ""'baggage',"", ""'arrival',"", ""'30',"", ""'mins',"", ""'chaotic',"", ""'process',"", ""'book',"", ""'sound',"", ""'light',"", ""'show',"", ""'online',"", ""'museums',"", ""'guess',"", ""'checkout',"", ""'pre',"", ""'book',"", ""'water',"", ""'sport',"", ""'book',"", ""'spot',"", ""'scuba',"", ""'one',"", ""'day',"", ""'earlier',"", ""'preferably']""]",False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

sorry i have to ask ... did they say that or is that your judgement? my father in his nineties enjoyed going to beach towns, though he wasn't a 'lay on the beach' kind of guy.
beach towns tend to have breezes which help make hot summer weather far more enjoyable. and a stroll along the beachfront, beats the pants off a stroll down a car clogged city street. realistically unless you require big city amenities (museums, art galleries, big shopping malls), beach communities have everything you need for a long stay.
most bigger beach communities here will have a substantial expat population and along with it, a bit of home comfort, western stores, foreigner oriented menus and such. however you can still go ""local"".

edited: 7:23 pm, january 16,","i notice the replies, some are like-minded, and enjoy knocking around the city's nook & crannies, and 'too long' isn't possible. others, and agree sort of, 3 or 4 nights is more than enough to see the 'iconic' sites, along with a market and or temple or 3.
if living in london, relative, you may or may not like the big mango. i know my first few visits, i hated it, and thought it nothing more than a giant slum. although, i did stay on lower suk, and didn't explore much. if used to squeaky clean western hygiene (appearance / smells (lack of sewer), then you can easily be put off.
now, after so many visits (100+) and still haven't seen it all, as krung thep metro is huge, i love arriving. and after a short week, i love leaving .... 🤣🤣🤣
being there on weekend has its pros & cons, more festive & more things open, but crowded. if you enjoy just knocking around & exploring a city's non touristy side, you'll love it.
but .... since coming from a big city, if so, and wanting beach time, you may want to prioritize that on first visit, as big city feeling can be found at home. especially coming from uk, as any beach, even thai's crappy ones along with warm weather would be a relief, from what i hear & read.🤣
my first thai beach experience was 20+ years ago, phuket, and got me on thinking about retiring in thailand. trip was actually a recon for retirement. 2nd beach holiday was pp, and sealed the idea.
hindsight, and when thailand opens to 'normal' tourism, i think pp would be my priority, as slow starting up again, before it turns back into a tourist ghetto, i think i'd prioritize my first visit after c19 there. save extensive exploration of the big mango for a later visit, as any changes there, will be for the better as they are revamping some areas already, and quite nicely.
about to revisit pp myself, before 2022, as looking lovely without tourist.
good thing not into ""museums/galleries"" .... they really suck here.

maybe for some people. i've been to dubai numerous times and still have no desire to go up there, no matter what floor. it seems at least pre-covid people would just hang up there and block the views and getting there earlier didn't help. i'm like, why pay for a view and people are going to be all in my view? and of course you have to go on the perfect day, or you'll see much of nothing due to the weather conditions.
i'm not sure if you have the ""dubai museum/fort"" on your list of places to go, but i can say, it will give you a good perspective of past and current dubai. it was only one dirham when i went both times. it's basically down the street from al ustad. i was provided a complimentary tour when i arrived the one time. if they have any tours going on, you can just follow the small group around. the tour guides work for the dubai government tourists office. that might be more worth than the visit than a ripleys type setting.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g295424-i872-k13569047-6_day_Itinerary_critique_please-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html,6 day Itinerary critique please!,AA,UK,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SKOOBDO?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,50,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,50,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,50,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,50,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,50,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,200,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,32500,"[""['worth',"", ""'pay',"", ""'148',"", ""'floor',"", ""'burj',"", ""'khalifa',"", ""'move',"", ""'needle',"", ""'experience',"", ""'people',"", ""'dubai',"", ""'numerous',"", ""'time',"", ""'desire',"", ""'matter',"", ""'floor',"", ""'least',"", ""'pre',"", ""'covid',"", ""'people',"", ""'hang',"", ""'block',"", ""'view',"", ""'earlier',"", ""'help',"", ""'pay',"", ""'view',"", ""'people',"", ""'view',"", ""'course',"", ""'perfect',"", ""'day',"", ""'see',"", ""'much',"", ""'due',"", ""'weather',"", ""'dubai',"", ""'museum',"", ""'fort',"", ""'place',"", ""'good',"", ""'perspective',"", ""'past',"", ""'current',"", ""'dubai',"", ""'one',"", ""'dirham',"", ""'time',"", ""'basically',"", ""'street',"", ""'al',"", ""'ustad',"", ""'provide',"", ""'complimentary',"", ""'tour',"", ""'arrive',"", ""'one',"", ""'time',"", ""'tour',"", ""'small',"", ""'group',"", ""'tour',"", ""'guide',"", ""'work',"", ""'dubai',"", ""'government',"", ""'tourists',"", ""'office',"", ""'worth',"", ""'visit',"", ""'ripleys',"", ""'type',"", ""'set']""]",False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

the other side of the street with the balmoral hotel, sir walter scott monument. the gardens and floral clock, the art gallery and the clear view of the bank of scotland ho on the mound, the 1100 hundred year old castle and 600 year old houses beside it - how the heck is this not historic?
i also think it unfair to judge a city on a brief day trip from london.
if she’s ventured on the water of leith walkway, she’s have thought herself in the countryside. she missed the beautiful royal botanic gardens and the national museum of scotland (with some excellent exhibitions on now like the galloway hoarde).any where in the old town screams of our history - there is no avoiding it.

try to study basic japanese etiquette; there are plenty of youtube videos on this topic.
when to go? check the climate data for japan. the summer is hot and humid. fall and spring are pleasant. try to avoid major japanese holiday periods, which are heavy travel periods for the japanese. i've tried august (way too hot and humid), september (still too humid), october (comfortable), and november (comfortable if you don't mind an occasional chill). there are typhoons in the fall, but i'd rather have a rainy day than a week of high humidity. see  .
where to stay? hotel rooms tend to be small. almost all neighborhoods are safe, so you can go cheap and still have a clean room in a safe area. i stay mostly at the toyoko inn hotel chain, where you get a tiny but clean room and free breakfast. it's a convenience to have a little refrigerator in the room, a microwave in the lobby, and coin-operated laundry machines; toyoko inns have them all. for other hotels, the rakuten travel website is a good start.
the japanese train system has excellent english signage and offers reliable service. you can find train schedules at www.hyperdia.com. consider the national japan rail pass and/or one of the regional rail passes.
if you want to see the katsura imperial villa garden in kyoto, you will need to make a reservation in advance.
consider adding nagasaki to your itinerary; the dejima museum is excellent. for more ideas of places to visit on kyushu, see 
you could also spend a couple of days in hiroshima to see the peace memorial museum, shukkeien garden, fukuromachi elementary school peace museum, and miyajima.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g294232-i525-k13505960-My_10_year_son_wants_to_visit_Japan_need_advise-Japan.html,My 10 year son wants to visit Japan - need advise,Bargainhunter,US,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bargainhunter?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,100,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,100,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,100,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,100,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,400,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,60000,"[""['10',"", ""'old',"", ""'serve',"", ""'translator',"", ""'tour',"", ""'guide',"", ""'parent',"", ""'opportunity',"", ""'encourage',"", ""'much',"", ""'trip',"", ""'plan',"", ""'handle',"", ""'try',"", ""'study',"", ""'basic',"", ""'japanese',"", ""'etiquette',"", ""'plenty',"", ""'youtube',"", ""'videos',"", ""'topic',"", ""'climate',"", ""'data',"", ""'japan',"", ""'summer',"", ""'hot',"", ""'humid',"", ""'fall',"", ""'spring',"", ""'pleasant',"", ""'try',"", ""'avoid',"", ""'major',"", ""'japanese',"", ""'holiday',"", ""'periods',"", ""'heavy',"", ""'travel',"", ""'periods',"", ""'japanese',"", ""'try',"", ""'august',"", ""'way',"", ""'hot',"", ""'humid',"", ""'september',"", ""'humid',"", ""'october',"", ""'comfortable',"", ""'november',"", ""'comfortable',"", ""'mind',"", ""'occasional',"", ""'chill',"", ""'typhoons',"", ""'fall',"", ""'rainy',"", ""'day',"", ""'week',"", ""'high',"", ""'humidity',"", ""'see',"", ""'stay',"", ""'hotel',"", ""'room',"", ""'tend',"", ""'small',"", ""'neighborhoods',"", ""'safe',"", ""'cheap',"", ""'clean',"", ""'room',"", ""'safe',"", ""'area',"", ""'stay',"", ""'mostly',"", ""'toyoko',"", ""'inn',"", ""'hotel',"", ""'chain',"", ""'tiny',"", ""'clean',"", ""'room',"", ""'free',"", ""'breakfast',"", ""'convenience',"", ""'little',"", ""'refrigerator',"", ""'room',"", ""'microwave',"", ""'lobby',"", ""'coin',"", ""'operate',"", ""'laundry',"", ""'machine',"", ""'toyoko',"", ""'inns',"", ""'hotels',"", ""'rakuten',"", ""'travel',"", ""'website',"", ""'good',"", ""'start',"", ""'japanese',"", ""'train',"", ""'system',"", ""'excellent',"", ""'english',"", ""'signage',"", ""'reliable',"", ""'service',"", ""'train',"", ""'schedule',"", ""'wwwhyperdiacom',"", ""'national',"", ""'japan',"", ""'rail',"", ""'pass',"", ""'one',"", ""'regional',"", ""'rail',"", ""'pass',"", ""'see',"", ""'katsura',"", ""'imperial',"", ""'villa',"", ""'garden',"", ""'kyoto',"", ""'reservation',"", ""'advance',"", ""'add',"", ""'nagasaki',"", ""'itinerary',"", ""'dejima',"", ""'museum',"", ""'excellent',"", ""'ideas',"", ""'place',"", ""'visit',"", ""'kyushu',"", ""'see',"", ""'spend',"", ""'couple',"", ""'days',"", ""'hiroshima',"", ""'see',"", ""'peace',"", ""'memorial',"", ""'museum',"", ""'shukkeien',"", ""'garden',"", ""'fukuromachi',"", ""'elementary',"", ""'school',"", ""'peace',"", ""'museum',"", ""'miyajima']""]",False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

many thanks","so we were supposed to be in khao lak for christmas and new year. obviously that didn't happen.
we've bumped it and are booked into the arinara (i'm aware it's closed atm) for christmas 2021.
without this descending into an argument about vaccines/quarantine. if we can't fly there or go without quarantine, tui will simply cancel it and i'll get my thousands back or amend the booking. i'm already vaccinated and had covid a year ago with a packet of paracetamol the solution.
is it easy to get a local private 'guide'.
i know i can book tours etc but i'm looking for maybe 2 days of travel, in a car, with just us 3.
google tells me average taxi driver earns 107 thb daily, grab driver 150thb daily.
i'd be happy to pay 200 -250 thb an hour if they don't drive like life is a roller coaster. english or german speaking at basic level also a bonus.
is this feasible?
am i being cheap and should i expect to pay much more? am i better off just asking locals or are there established companies that offer these services?
i'd like to travel up to khao lak, my daughter wants to go back to the tsunami museum and what not. we also enjoy chasing waterfalls that are not hip deep in tourists.

baan khaolak resort (assuming it is in the same location today) is at the southern end of nang thong beach, so understandable that it was a long walk back then. but today you will find more dining options and such within a short stroll, as khao lak has grown considerably over the years.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g297914-i10908-k13477587-Hotels_in_Khoa_Lak-Khao_Lak_Phang_Nga_Province.html,Hotels in Khoa Lak,MrCycling 🚵‍♂️,US,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrCycling?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,50,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,50,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,50,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,200,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,50,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,50,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,32500,"[""['khunbill',"", ""'khao',"", ""'lak',"", ""'cover',"", ""'long',"", ""'stretch',"", ""'highway',"", ""'much',"", ""'long',"", ""'bang',"", ""'niang',"", ""'area',"", ""'main',"", ""'part',"", ""'town',"", ""'lot',"", ""'eateries',"", ""'tsunami',"", ""'museum',"", ""'night',"", ""'market',"", ""'nang',"", ""'thong',"", ""'beach',"", ""'south',"", ""'number',"", ""'two',"", ""'easy',"", ""'walk',"", ""'eateries',"", ""'shop',"", ""'baan',"", ""'khaolak',"", ""'resort',"", ""'assume',"", ""'location',"", ""'today',"", ""'southern',"", ""'end',"", ""'nang',"", ""'thong',"", ""'beach',"", ""'understandable',"", ""'long',"", ""'walk',"", ""'today',"", ""'din',"", ""'options',"", ""'short',"", ""'stroll',"", ""'khao',"", ""'lak',"", ""'grow',"", ""'considerably']""]",False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

if living in london, relative, you may or may not like the big mango. i know my first few visits, i hated it, and thought it nothing more than a giant slum. although, i did stay on lower suk, and didn't explore much. if used to squeaky clean western hygiene (appearance / smells (lack of sewer), then you can easily be put off.
now, after so many visits (100+) and still haven't seen it all, as krung thep metro is huge, i love arriving. and after a short week, i love leaving .... 🤣🤣🤣
being there on weekend has its pros & cons, more festive & more things open, but crowded. if you enjoy just knocking around & exploring a city's non touristy side, you'll love it.
but .... since coming from a big city, if so, and wanting beach time, you may want to prioritize that on first visit, as big city feeling can be found at home. especially coming from uk, as any beach, even thai's crappy ones along with warm weather would be a relief, from what i hear & read.🤣
my first thai beach experience was 20+ years ago, phuket, and got me on thinking about retiring in thailand. trip was actually a recon for retirement. 2nd beach holiday was pp, and sealed the idea.
hindsight, and when thailand opens to 'normal' tourism, i think pp would be my priority, as slow starting up again, before it turns back into a tourist ghetto, i think i'd prioritize my first visit after c19 there. save extensive exploration of the big mango for a later visit, as any changes there, will be for the better as they are revamping some areas already, and quite nicely.
about to revisit pp myself, before 2022, as looking lovely without tourist.
good thing not into ""museums/galleries"" .... they really suck here.

plan day by day itineraries so you don’t have to keep doubling back on yourselves. divide singapore into areas and concentrate your daily activities, where possible,
for example, you probably wouldn’t want to go to the zoo and the gardens by the bay on the same day, that’s a lot of walking in one day. so planning is everything.
i’ve often (endlessly indeed lol ) advised people “do less see more”. so planning is everything to maximise your singapore experience.
i know it sounds obvious, but you’ll be amazed how many people think they can do everything because singapore is small, but trust me there is way more to do than you will ever get done, so you can afford to be really selective and have an amazing time in singapore.
as our other friends have said, walking to/from the very excellent mrt can be quite “challenging” especially, if like me, walking is an issue.
taxis, are compared to the u.k, ridiculously inexpensive and super safe. all journeys are metered, which are clearly visible to the passengers, but do not ever allow any taxi driver to “tout” you.
whereas singapore is one of the safest and honest places on the planet, there are always a few rotten eggs in the basket, but very few in singapore thankfully.
just an example in the link of some of singapore’s wonderful attractions.

the kids club and facilities at jumeriah for children are excellent and the wild wadi water park is better for smaller children - the kids club at jumeriah is free and the one at atlantis is chargeable.
the jumeirah property is on the mainland whereas atlantis is at the end of the palm so taxis cost more to get to other areas of the city.
the jumeriah property is closer to mall of the emirates (lots of kids facilities) and dubai mall (even more kids facilities) and the underwater zoo and aquarium at dubai mall knocks lost chambers at atlantis out of the park.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g295424-i872-k13632435-Jumeriah_Dar_Al_Masyaf_or_Atlantis_Palm-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html,Jumeriah Dar Al Masyaf or Atlantis Palm?,Latimer,UK,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Latimer?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,100,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,100,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,20000,"[""['forum',"", ""'many',"", ""'many',"", ""'99',"", ""'people',"", ""'pick',"", ""'jumeirah',"", ""'atlantis',"", ""'day',"", ""'week',"", ""'numerous',"", ""'topics',"", ""'question',"", ""'jumeirah',"", ""'win',"", ""'kid',"", ""'club',"", ""'facilities',"", ""'jumeriah',"", ""'children',"", ""'excellent',"", ""'wild',"", ""'wadi',"", ""'water',"", ""'park',"", ""'smaller',"", ""'children',"", ""'kid',"", ""'club',"", ""'jumeriah',"", ""'free',"", ""'one',"", ""'atlantis',"", ""'chargeable',"", ""'jumeirah',"", ""'property',"", ""'mainland',"", ""'whereas',"", ""'atlantis',"", ""'end',"", ""'palm',"", ""'taxis',"", ""'cost',"", ""'areas',"", ""'city',"", ""'jumeriah',"", ""'property',"", ""'closer',"", ""'mall',"", ""'emirates',"", ""'lot',"", ""'kid',"", ""'facilities',"", ""'dubai',"", ""'mall',"", ""'kid',"", ""'facilities',"", ""'underwater',"", ""'zoo',"", ""'aquarium',"", ""'dubai',"", ""'mall',"", ""'knock',"", ""'lose',"", ""'chamber',"", ""'atlantis',"", ""'park']""]",False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

edited: 11:44 pm, april 14,","i don't know what people mean when people talk about business are permanently closed.
a individual may sell or close a business. it happens all the time. i know 80% of businesses close within 12 months of opening in australia. they think they can run a business, turns out they can't. video stores came and went.
the small businesses on the island do not require much capital to set up.
if businesses close. a new business will replace them if there is the demand.
businesses may be closed, the individual who ran that business may have moved on. there will be a new business there if there is a need for the new business.
businesses will only be permanently shut if no tourists come back.
if no tourists come back then the islands will return to the way they were prior to the being converted into tourist zones.
mining towns are the same, the ore runs out, the town's reason for existence ceases. most of the business infrastructure on the islands exists solely to service tourists. it is designed, built and used for one purpose only, to cater for the needs, wants, desires of international tourists.
that is why the islands are suffering so much. no international tourists, no business.
the stuff on the islands is like the stuff in a theme park (island in thailand), no customers, international tourists, then the theme park shuts.
don't worry about the permanent closure of businesses, if the customers come back, the rides will be rebuilt. they will be built to whatever the customer desires.

it got pretty bright by 5:30 am and dark by 5 pm in the evening since we were so east of the indian time line. we were served breakfast at 7 am and proceeded towards madhuri lake (sangetsar lake) by 7:40 am. we reached y junction at around 9 am and then took the fork towards madhuri lake. i had four french toasts and started to feel sick (could be the egg yellows?). we stopped at a canteen run by the sikh regiment. the army guys were very friendly and offer all the travellers biscuits, hot water and tea. there is also a washroom which the girls used. they even make an effort to talk to the tourists. there is a gurudwara at the top where guru nanak is believed to have meditated. i could feel a bit of a pressure on my lungs and the army guy told me not to take a chance. i popped up a diamox (used for altitude sickness) and proceeded anyway. the road towards madhuri lake is downwards and i soon started feeling better.
we reached madhuri lake around 10:45 am. the lake has stubs of trees within it. apparently the lake was originally a forest and around half a century back the lake was formed due to an earthquake. the lake was surrounded by icy mountains and the wind chill made the place really cold although the temperature there may not be as low. the lake looks good during the monsoon when it is bright blue in color. it is also called madhuri lake as madhuri dixit and sharukh khan danced here for a song in the 90s movie – koyla. in the 90s war, a brave soldier called jaswant singh rawat defended indian territory with his life. he was assisted by locals two of them were women who were named sela and nuranang. sela pass and nuranang falls were named after them.
we had some snacks in the army canteen, took some pictures and left madhuri lake by noon. on the way we again stopped at some photo stops at frozen lakes. we stopped at ptso lake and made two snowmen. while we were there, hailstones started falling much to our delight.
after half an hour we proceeded back to our hotel and called out to arindham that we wanted to go to the monastery. poor guy was having his lunch and we did not know we interrupted it. the monastery was closer than expected and we reached within 2 mins. when we went into the monastery, it was huge and we had no idea where to go or what to do. nevertheless, we went in. we met a local there who seemed very friendly, and told us he works in the collectors office and should we need any assistance while in tawang, we can contact him. we saw different houses and buildings in the monastery. classes were on and we did not want to disturb any of them. we went to the monastery museum (rs. 20) and looked at all the buddhist artifacts. the colorful yet scary masks worn by dancers caught our eye.
when we came out of the museum, classes had left and the courtyard was full of kids studying to be lamas. they were like normal kids playing around and making a lot of noise. we noticed them grab packs of chips just like normal kids would do.
after we left the monastery, arindham took us to the mon valley hotel. in the hotel i realized the cause of the sick feeling was my tummy, i could feel it churn uncomfortably. i had only the soup that accompanied the momos. monpa people don’t have non-veg on wednesdays, and so the hotel had only veg food that day. the chowmein was tasty nevertheless.
sorry for this detail, but i had got diarrhea meanwhile we reached our room. it started to pour heavily (outside hahaha) with strong bolts of lightening and thunder. our hotel had no electricity and intermittent starts of the generator allowed to heat some water. at one point lightening struck really closeby and our heater sparked with the surge. fortunately it was not damaged.

i have been training at muay thai for over a year in my own country, so, that is the context of wanting to go. the last 5 years nearly all of my ""holidays"" have actually be training camps to different countries for my previous sport. so, i do like an activity when i travel.
i will be travelling solo, so, an activity helps too. i'd obviously like to visit some museums, see some sights and culture and a little nightlife. but i'm not really interested in the usual backpacker, heavy drinking scene that some of my friends have gone to thailand for.

yes it has been wet this may but i've still managed to go out and cycle with friends, sit outside at a cafe, go for walks etc so it's not kept so indoors all month.
either time you are looking at is a great time to visit. i'd have the deciding factor on if one month over another enables you to visit / experience something that is only available at certain times of the year.

edited: 4:54 pm, february 03,","@toopaz, yes we visited the landmark a couple of times when it re-opened, when selladoor took over. the quarterdeck café was opened and the toilets were closed to the public. you had to buy something before using the wc, so it wasn't public as it was before. they were advertising live stage shows and screenings. i think francis rossi and jimmy tarbuck were there. when the theatre re-opened after it changed hands i think ian mckellen was there on the night, and there was some live theatre outside last summer.
it didn't have the same atmosphere as before, not to say it was worse, but it was different.
the landmark used to be very busy with a lot of staff, as well as the ticket kiosks open. local players put on oliver one christmas. there were dance groups etc, backroom staff, and rooms were used for groups and fairs. stalls and displays in the front foyer, such as ilfracombe museum. lots of stuff going on for kids on the front green, bouncy castles and such like. during victorian week all the costumed actors would be there; victorian men, jugglers, victorian ladies and suffragette re-enactors.

she’s a writer and loves history and nature- she scrimps and saves on everything- we want to give her a 3-4 day splurge to immerse herself in an historical adventure. she would like to visit stirling castle- has not been to glasgow yet- she will have 1-2 who would like to join- so max would need a room for 3. she also loves old bookstores.
with a budget of £300 per night, and needing to just carry a single backpack- no car- but savvy with buses/trains and doesn’t mind long walks…any historical places or scenic trails between glasgow and stirling? or, if you think of any other area- she could easily switch. she camped the nc500 in may, she’s been to edinburgh twice to hit the old bookstores and museums/cathedrals…and along the coast near fife. has not toured any castles other than ruins along some trails…that’s high on her list.

","i would add to the suggestions, if you are prepared to drive for just over an hour in each direction, kippford (near dalbeattie) or kirkcudbright.
kippford has a nice outlook over the estuary, a coastal drive and a good tearoom (the ark). drive the a710 via dumfries and new abbey at least one way for the coastal views, and return via moniaive for a countryside outlook.
kirkcudbright is a picturesque town - it has a castle in the centre, some nice art galleries, a harbour, broughton house (nts property) and several cafes (the selkirk arms, a hotel, also does nice meals). the coast in that area is also scenic and there are several good beaches including brighouse bay.

good luck","welcome,
note at the top of each destination board is a ""things to do and see"". i have attached a link for your convenience....

just a personal comment. 10 years is alot of time. so depending on what you saw, it may have changed. things like museums can change/offer different exhibits and such.
but from there, you should be able to figure out what to do and see.
when i travel, i usually have 2,3, 4 or 5 things to do in a day, but i do more planning than asking. if things are close together, where i can walk across the street or down a road to see 5 things, i maybe able to do so, but if i have to hop around a city and a large city, it may take more time. then you have the subject. for example, when i was in paris i spent 1/2 + day in there. i had budgeted 1/2 day but i felt and knew i would spend more time.
if all you want to do is to check things off a list, then you can do alot. depending on your interest you may spend more/less time and only you will know this.
if you want to see outdoorsy things like parks, note they will probably be open 24/7. so you can see those on off hours. things like museums will probably have open/close days and so i would focus on those during open hours. and some places may have days they are closed or days that open late.

3 days is too short in my opinion, so you can plan one day for kumbakonam and thanjavur, one day for rameswaram and dhanushkodi and the third day for madurai.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g297674-i6777-k13472661-Need_help_to_plan_Chennai_to_Rameshwaram_trip-Tamil_Nadu.html,Need help to plan Chennai to Rameshwaram trip,ravi_vee,Galaxy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ravi_vee?tab=forum,0,0,50,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,50,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,50.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,200,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,27500,"[""['mode',"", ""'travel',"", ""'cab',"", ""'car',"", ""'bet',"", ""'train',"", ""'limit',"", ""'train',"", ""'run',"", ""'overnight',"", ""'train',"", ""'chennai',"", ""'kumbakonam',"", ""'local',"", ""'cab',"", ""'bus',"", ""'temple',"", ""'visit',"", ""'thanjavur',"", ""'far',"", ""'kumbakonam',"", ""'thanjavur',"", ""'proceed',"", ""'rameswaram',"", ""'bus',"", ""'madurai',"", ""'chennai',"", ""'train',"", ""'place',"", ""'see',"", ""'interest',"", ""'pilgrimage',"", ""'type',"", ""'trip',"", ""'navagraha',"", ""'temples',"", ""'brahadeeswarar',"", ""'temple',"", ""'multitude',"", ""'temples',"", ""'thanjavur',"", ""'architecture',"", ""'three',"", ""'live',"", ""'chola',"", ""'temples',"", ""'thanjavur',"", ""'darasuram',"", ""'gangaikondacholapuram',"", ""'require',"", ""'full',"", ""'day',"", ""'visit',"", ""'danushkodi',"", ""'rameswaram',"", ""'3',"", ""'days',"", ""'short',"", ""'opinion',"", ""'plan',"", ""'one',"", ""'day',"", ""'kumbakonam',"", ""'thanjavur',"", ""'one',"", ""'day',"", ""'rameswaram',"", ""'dhanushkodi',"", ""'third',"", ""'day',"", ""'madurai']""]",False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

it’s interesting don’t it’s good bastakiya dubai museum worth visit you’re part dubai.
have considered yellow boat tour palm, plenty photo opportunities otherwise it’s case taking pictures land palm. you’re going ariel view ground ( pass plane)
whilst palm fab hotels cannot see it’s shape design ground yellow boats tour offer good photo opportunities
edited: 6:04 pm, january 10,","heritage village is not an amusement park but more like a museum/ place of historic interest which gives an insight into traditional working life in the uae prior to becoming an oil rich emirate.
it’s interesting but i don’t think it’s as good as bastakiya and the dubai museum but worth a visit if you’re over this part of dubai.
have you considered yellow boat tour around the palm, you get plenty of photo opportunities otherwise it’s just a case of taking pictures on land on the palm. you’re not going to get an ariel view from the ground ( you might pass over it on the plane)
whilst the palm has some fab hotels you cannot really see it’s shape or design from the ground but yellow boats tour does offer some good photo opportunities

start at the museum and have a little wander through - its relatively cheap and should keep the family entertained for an hour. then have a walk through al fahidi/bastikiya area which is close (old buildings by the creek). wander along the creek (new bit called al seef). double back through the textile souk to the abra station. hop over to the other side of the creek and wander through the spice souk (my fav bit) to the gold souk. retrace your steps to the other side of the creek to get back to your hotel.
the abra crossing, i maintain, is the best value in dubai at 1 aed per person. it's great at dusk as you hear the call to prayer broadcast from the mosques.
in june you will be governed by the heat and your 4 yo so make sure you have water with you and take it easy.

if it’s closed then i would suggest starting at al seef and wandering towards the abra station along the creek. it’s worth a look at the fort whilst in the area.
normally suggest suggest starting the tour in the museum as it gives you a nice overview of dubai’s origins.

from sendai, you could make day trips to matsushima, hiraizumi, and kakunodate. the region is trying to revive tourism after the 2011 earthquake and tsunami, so your visit will be appreciated.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g294232-i525-k13558951-Suggestions_on_locations_to_visit-Japan.html,Suggestions on locations to visit?,Bargainhunter,US,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bargainhunter?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,300,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,300,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,60000,"[""['place',"", ""'kyushu',"", ""'recommend',"", ""'nagasaki',"", ""'atomic',"", ""'bomb',"", ""'museum',"", ""'worthwhile',"", ""'smaller',"", ""'museum',"", ""'hiroshima',"", ""'dejima',"", ""'museum',"", ""'excellent',"", ""'small',"", ""'museum',"", ""'promote',"", ""'local',"", ""'tourism',"", ""'office',"", ""'document',"", ""'japanese',"", ""'war',"", ""'crimes',"", ""'see',"", ""'sendai',"", ""'day',"", ""'trip',"", ""'matsushima',"", ""'hiraizumi',"", ""'kakunodate',"", ""'region',"", ""'try',"", ""'revive',"", ""'tourism',"", ""'2011',"", ""'earthquake',"", ""'tsunami',"", ""'visit']""]",False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

my preference is for mid-october through late november. there might be a typhoon for a day or two in october, but i can use those days as museum or shopping days.
the short days in the fall are a disadvantage, but that can be mitigated if you can wake up early (not me!!). if you don't have the stamina to sightsee for more than 6 hours a day, the shorter days don't matter.

hida folk village vs shirakawa-go - have visited both. the former is more akin to an open air museum whereas locals have been living in latter for centuries. for those who could not make it to the latter, the former is indeed the next best substitute.
in takayama old town, also check out the yatai kaikan where yatai used in the annual takayama festivals are exhibited.

there is no tunnel nor elbow turns b/w tokyo/shinjuku and kawaguchi-ko along the chuo expressway - validate on google map. unlike bus drivers elsewhere in europe, most bus drivers in japan are way more cautious and seldom make abrupt stops unless it's necessary. besides, in japan the speed limits are much lower - 50km/h on national roads and less than 110km/h on expressways. on average, it hardly steers faster than 80km/h.
indeed, the train option is a viable alternative, though bus ride is comparatively benign. only you can tell if it'd be bearable. sitting behind the bus driver and taking window seats as suggested by sammy are some good ideas to alleviate motion sickness.
train fares b/w shinjuku and kawaguchi-ko for reserved seats cost jpy4,130. refer to route #1 in the link below.

>>and, of course, with my leaning towards so many trains, it might make it more cost effective for us to get the jr pass
not really. roughly speaking, the 14-day jr pass pays off if a round trip b/w tokyo and hiroshima by shinkansen (on long distance routes) is taken within 14 days. note that train fares of jr express trains cost much less, such as jr kaiyu or azusa serving the jr chuo line. besides, daily commutes on city subways are not covered at all. thus, the value of jr pass drops substantially while stationing in large cities.
if you depart from osaka/kix, then it's very likely you'd overpay a lot by buying jr pass, which is not cheap.

we are in the early stages of planning a trip for our family of four in may 2022. we are a couple in our 40’s with two children age 19 and 14. we are budget travelers, and typically do airbnb when traveling to europe. our interests are: anime and pop-culture, amusement parks, architecture, great inexpensive food, stunning natural sights, light hiking, art, some of the must-see temples but not a temple every day, unique cultural experiences.
i would appreciate your input on the following itinerary:
day 1 - fly out of the us
day 2 - arrive in japan and get settled
day 3 - 7 - tokyo
(priorities in tokyo are: harajuku and akihabara for anime and pop culture, ghibli museum, disneysea or skycircus or both, teambordeless lab, imperial palace and 1 temple/shrine, hedgehog or owl café, unique pop culture activity suggestions welcome)
day 8 - travel to jigokudani monkey park, stay in matsumoto or kamikochi area (we are thinking about renting a car for this leg of the trip in the more rural areas)
day 9 - hiking in the matsumoto or kamikochi area, maybe see the castle in matsumoto and shomyo falls.
day 10 - travel to takayama and explore area
day 11 - explore takayama, ainokura
day 12- travel to kyoto by train? (not sure if we should stay in kyoto 2 days or stay in osaka and do one day trip to kyoto)

day 14 - kyoto
day 15 - travel back to tokyo or osaka (will try to leave from osaka)

i think there has been a change made to access to the museum from hoxton overground station, but if you'd like to take the bus from liverpool street the 149 will take you there - don't alight at the stop for hoxton station but use the stop on the far side of falkirk street as it's nearer the museum entrance.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g186338-i17-k13653357-Been_to_London_a_lot_recommendations_for_next_visit-London_England.html,Been to London a lot - recommendations for next visit?,TravellerPlus,CA,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravellerPlus?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,400,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,400,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,80000,"[""['geffrye',"", ""'museum',"", ""'refurbishment',"", ""'new',"", ""'name',"", ""'prior',"", ""'worth',"", ""'visit',"", ""'small',"", ""'greenspace',"", ""'museum',"", ""'kingsland',"", ""'road',"", ""'one',"", ""'favourite',"", ""'spot',"", ""'escape',"", ""'busyness',"", ""'london',"", ""'despite',"", ""'adjacent',"", ""'main',"", ""'road',"", ""'peaceful',"", ""'area',"", ""'walk',"", ""'sit',"", ""'garden',"", ""'rear',"", ""'museum',"", ""'lush',"", ""'high',"", ""'summer',"", ""'good',"", ""'nick',"", ""'month',"", ""'access',"", ""'museum',"", ""'hoxton',"", ""'overground',"", ""'station',"", ""'youd',"", ""'bus',"", ""'liverpool',"", ""'street',"", ""'149',"", ""'alight',"", ""'stop',"", ""'hoxton',"", ""'station',"", ""'stop',"", ""'far',"", ""'side',"", ""'falkirk',"", ""'street',"", ""'nearer',"", ""'museum',"", ""'entrance']""]",False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

edited: 10:17 am, august 26,","i've been to london (mostly) as a solo female traveler over 70 times! (mr. jtwiz has joined me 5 of those trips.) so i'm always on the lookout for something new to do or re-visit some place that has a special exhibit for example.
i agree with visting the wallace collection - definitely take the free guided tour. you learn so much from it. my last trip there was to see a fantastic exhibit of manolo blahnik shoes that were interspersed with the art collection. that's the kind of exhibit i look for.
i notice you didn't mention the v&a. that is by far my favorite museum in london. i've gone there countless times. i see they currently have an exhibition of hand bags, it looks great.
the churchill war rooms are indeed worth a trip. absolutely fascinating tour. i also love greenwich, beside visiting the observatory, the maritime museum is also interesting. and i always enjoy perusing the small street market in greenwich as well. definitely take a boat at least one way. always fun to see london from the water.
do you like gardens? the royal botanic gardens at kew are fantastic and easy to get to via tube. fyi. my last trip there was to see the chihuly exhibit. wow, that was a great day out.
other easy day trips include windsor, hampton court palace, st. albans.

definitely a boat trip one way, but i like to go out on the dlr to island gardens on the north side of the thames, from where you get a great view of the naval college across the river, then walk under the thames through the victorian pedestrian tunnel.
the first time i went through canary wharf (having never seen the skyscpaers of the states) i felt like i was in batman' gotham city!
you can do a variation by getting off the dlr a couple of stops earlier at mudchure, visit the city farm for the surreal sight of sheep against the background of skyscrapers (!) then walk down through the isle of dogs to island gardens.
over in greenwich itself i love the maritime museum, so much about exploring the world over the centuries (free, so if less your thing you don't need to spend much time, but there is also a great shop) . there's also the observatory and the meridian line, greenwich park, the cutty sark, the market ( not sure which days). i've now discovered that the queen's house sounds really interesting, and regret not visiting. greenwich was one of the homes of the tudor royals, and i believe henry viii was baptised at the church (st. afage's???). interesting to think of the baptising of the baby that would go on to sever the church from rome .....!

assuming covid travel restrictions are resolved, i will be visiting london with my two young adult sons for 6 days in late january 2022. this will be our second visit to this most excellent city. we are staying in a hotel near earl's court. we are very comfortable on the underground. we will be arriving via train from edinburgh on a monday afternoon and leaving via a flight from lhr the following sunday afternoon.
we enjoy general exploring and not overly planned days. this is my 'definitely need to make happen' itinerary, but would love your thoughts on interesting additions.
monday- arrive early afternoon, would love to have a not overly pricey dinner in the area of earl's court (overly pricey= more than 20 pounds per entre)
tuesday- borough market (a highlight from last visit), british museum- didn't make it last time, the boys are not big museum fans, but darn it, it will be a priority for me anyway.
wednesday- maybe a show? globe theater or tickets from leicester square site for something lighter.
thursday- probably will need another visit to borough market by now... nothing else planned as yet
friday- me and the younger one will be taking a train to the tank museum in bovington.
saturday- portobello market (?).
sunday- 15:30 flight to dublin. thoughts on how early we need to get to the airport?
in order to make some appropriate recommendations, when last we were there, we went to, and enjoyed: tower of london, greenwich observatory, royal navel college, british library, churchill war rooms, tate britain, museum of london, and highgate cemetery. probably do not need to return to these attractions this visit though.
also, i know january is likely not the best time of year to visit, but that is the time frame i have due to my work schedule.

ok so if crowds are why you want to avoid big cities you then need to think wider than cities. port isaac where doc martin is filmed can get horribly busy. in april the crowding in padstow when we went was bad enough we skipped through to a couple of things we really wanted but left to go elsewhere faster than we normally would.
there are popular places that get very crowded (durdle door on the south coast for example). popular attractions that are gated, tintagel castle leaps to mind, didnt suffer the crowding problems earlier this year as they controlled numbers well. however open access places - more of a problem. that will be true throughout the uk and the solutions will equally vary.
oh and i highlighted a few places that i like - part of my point was that despite being good there are a lot more that you can and will enjoy that you need to look at rather than simply follow my list. where your interests and mine diverge, so can our enjoyment of some places. it takes a lot to get me into an art gallery or studio for example (although maurice bishop is one exception that i make routinely)",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g186216-i15-k13616590-Two_mont_Uk_sometimes_on_the_road_trip-United_Kingdom.html,Two mont Uk ( sometimes on the ) road trip,Myrm,IS,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/myrm?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,100,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,100,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,100,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,30000,"[""['watch',"", ""'doc',"", ""'martin',"", ""'cornwall',"", ""'crowd',"", ""'avoid',"", ""'big',"", ""'cities',"", ""'wider',"", ""'cities',"", ""'port',"", ""'isaac',"", ""'doc',"", ""'martin',"", ""'film',"", ""'horribly',"", ""'busy',"", ""'april',"", ""'crowd',"", ""'padstow',"", ""'bad',"", ""'skip',"", ""'couple',"", ""'elsewhere',"", ""'faster',"", ""'normally',"", ""'popular',"", ""'place',"", ""'crowd',"", ""'durdle',"", ""'door',"", ""'south',"", ""'coast',"", ""'example',"", ""'popular',"", ""'attractions',"", ""'gate',"", ""'tintagel',"", ""'castle',"", ""'leap',"", ""'mind',"", ""'suffer',"", ""'crowd',"", ""'problems',"", ""'earlier',"", ""'control',"", ""'number',"", ""'open',"", ""'access',"", ""'place',"", ""'problem',"", ""'true',"", ""'throughout',"", ""'uk',"", ""'solutions',"", ""'equally',"", ""'vary',"", ""'oh',"", ""'highlight',"", ""'place',"", ""'part',"", ""'point',"", ""'despite',"", ""'good',"", ""'lot',"", ""'simply',"", ""'interest',"", ""'diverge',"", ""'enjoyment',"", ""'place',"", ""'lot',"", ""'art',"", ""'gallery',"", ""'studio',"", ""'example',"", ""'maurice',"", ""'bishop',"", ""'one',"", ""'exception',"", ""'routinely']""]",False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

(keep mind people post answers forum travel independently, detect hint bias.)","a tour would make sense if you have an unlimited budget, want to give the japanese economy a boost, are terrified of being in a foreign country, want to travel only to remote areas, need special assistance, or are too busy or too uninterested to plan your trip.
all typical first trip destinations can be easily reached by public transportation, mostly trains and subways. trains and subways have excellent english signage, actually better than many american cities. buses are a little bit more difficult, but you won't need them very much and the drivers are quite helpful to foreign tourists. if you plan your trip yourself, you can decide how much time to spend at each location, based on your interests. you can spend a full day at the tokyo national museum or just 10 minutes at their gift shop! you can choose hotels that fit your budget. you won't have to pay for the services of a tour escort or tour bus. with the money you save by not taking a tour, you could extend your trip to 2, 3, or maybe even 4 weeks, which will give you more time to enjoy japan. and you won't have to deal with the risk that the tour will include an annoying person who chatters endlessly and never stops complaining.
(keep in mind that most of the people who post answers on this forum travel independently, so you might detect a hint of bias.)",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g294232-i525-k13490232-Vacation_without_travel_company-Japan.html,Vacation without travel company,Bargainhunter,US,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bargainhunter?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,100,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,100,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,100,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,100,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,100,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,50000,"[""['tour',"", ""'sense',"", ""'unlimited',"", ""'budget',"", ""'japanese',"", ""'economy',"", ""'boost',"", ""'terrify',"", ""'foreign',"", ""'country',"", ""'travel',"", ""'remote',"", ""'areas',"", ""'special',"", ""'assistance',"", ""'busy',"", ""'uninterested',"", ""'plan',"", ""'trip',"", ""'typical',"", ""'trip',"", ""'destinations',"", ""'easily',"", ""'reach',"", ""'public',"", ""'transportation',"", ""'mostly',"", ""'train',"", ""'subways',"", ""'train',"", ""'subways',"", ""'excellent',"", ""'english',"", ""'signage',"", ""'many',"", ""'american',"", ""'cities',"", ""'bus',"", ""'little',"", ""'difficult',"", ""'much',"", ""'drivers',"", ""'quite',"", ""'helpful',"", ""'foreign',"", ""'tourists',"", ""'plan',"", ""'trip',"", ""'much',"", ""'time',"", ""'spend',"", ""'location',"", ""'base',"", ""'interest',"", ""'spend',"", ""'full',"", ""'day',"", ""'tokyo',"", ""'national',"", ""'museum',"", ""'10',"", ""'minutes',"", ""'gift',"", ""'shop',"", ""'hotels',"", ""'fit',"", ""'budget',"", ""'pay',"", ""'service',"", ""'tour',"", ""'escort',"", ""'tour',"", ""'bus',"", ""'money',"", ""'save',"", ""'tour',"", ""'extend',"", ""'trip',"", ""'2',"", ""'3',"", ""'4',"", ""'weeks',"", ""'time',"", ""'japan',"", ""'deal',"", ""'risk',"", ""'tour',"", ""'include',"", ""'annoy',"", ""'person',"", ""'chatter',"", ""'endlessly',"", ""'stop',"", ""'complain',"", ""'keep',"", ""'mind',"", ""'people',"", ""'post',"", ""'forum',"", ""'travel',"", ""'independently',"", ""'detect',"", ""'hint',"", ""'bias']""]",False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

thanks help!","hello! we jumped on one of the cheap tokyo flight deals for november with the expectation that we will likely have to push the trip further out... but in the meantime, i love researching and planning trips, and here i am digging through tripadvisor again!
we did an amazing 2 weeks in japan in november 2019 and covered all of the major first-timer places: tokyo, kamakura/enoshima, kyoto, nara, osaka, himeji, hiroshima/miyajima, fukuoka (sumo tournament/nanzoin buddha). disneysea.
now i'm looking for advice on what to do for a second trip! we love doing a bit of everything - covering the most famous stuff, pretty temples/gardens (especially if we are there for fall leaves) again, easy hikes, eating, and just wandering. my husband does japanese calligraphy as a hobby, so we're also looking for museums/classes/shops for his interests.
we are planning to do hakone/mt. fuji area and a few days around kyoto/osaka because there is so much to see and do there (i really want to do the aquarium!). and in my research, i've recently discovered the ""diamond route"" term for fukushima, ibaraki, and tochigi prefectures. since nikko is definitely a place i want to go this time, i was wondering if the other locations are worth spending 3-4 days exploring, something like: tokyo > mito > koriyama > urabandai > aizu-wakamatsu > ouchijuku > nikko > utsunomiya > tokyo?
we would do this ourselves on trains/buses, not through a tour company, but here are example itineraries to illustrate what i'm thinking: 
so any other advice for our second trip itinerary?
days 1-2 tokyo
3-7 diamond route? or just a nikko day trip and then go somewhere else?
8-11 kyoto/osaka - other day trips besides nara to do?
12-14 hakone/mt. fuji

for most visitors, an overnight stay in hakone would suffice after a day visit along the hakone loop, excluding museum visits.
consider the odakyu hakone freepass which payoff after completing the loop once. in your case, buy it after arriving at odawara station by tokaido shinkansen.

in kyoto, take city subways and commuter trains including hankyu, keihan as much as possible to avoid traffic jams. city buses are slow and usually quite full along popular routes. with 3 adults or more, just take a taxi to spots not closely served by public transports.

i don't much like business hotels. the only one l stayed in had a tiny window too high up to see out of and by stretching my arms l could touch both sides of the room. i like the b hotels, which mainly have a young clientel and l have stayed in the one in akasaka a number of times. it also has the advantage of being close to the new otani, where l used to stay, so l can go for a stroll in the famous garden and buy an overpriced cake and a coffee. (japanese men only buy cake in secret).
for the japanese experience it is worth having a night in a cheaper ryokan, which will still not be cheap, but l never feel comfortable as no one speaks english and l don't have a clue what is going on. expensive ones have english speaking staff but they really are expensive.
the japanese are very envious of people who can buy a rail pass which allows you, should you choose, to take a thousand or more pounds of travel for a couple of hundred. i really love travelling on the shinkansen, which is fast, civilised, spacious and, by high speed rail standards, very quiet. it is an experience to see the japanese collect all their rubbish and queue to put it in the appropriate bins at the end of the journey leaving the train immaculately clean. (you will see them looking disapprovingly at foreign tourists who don't do the same).
to experience japanese standards of service buy your rail passes from jtb in london and, if you can afford the extra fare, fly with jal or anna.
we were brought up in northern ireland which we visit every year and l find costs as a visitor not significantly different to those in japan. something that is different is that it is much cheaper to visit japanese tourist sites such as shrines and temples.
at any rate outside tokyo it is worth considering an occasional stay in a four star hotel as room rates can be very reasonable. the osaka new otani, an excellent hotel, is no more expensive than the radisson at shaw's bridge. just don't eat in the hotel or buy one of the paintings in the art gallery. when l once asked the price of one the sales person didn't have enough zeros on the calculator to show me.
at least with your girlfriend you won't be tempted to have a look at any of the dodgier clubs in shinjuku. an innocent university lecturer l knew paid £10 to get into one and £500 to get out again.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g294232-i525-k13513542-Japan_trip_budget_advice_please-Japan.html,Japan trip budget advice please,Robert

for those of you who want to know a fuller description of how this journey takes shape, read on.
i will travel with my wife who may or may not need a wheelchair to move about. if we were to travel right now she definitely would because long walking would set off pains in her leg, shoulder and arm. she's still mobile enough to climb a flight of stairs, hop on and off an escalator, or wander around a beautiful garden or temple if necessary. we'd rather take an elevator to change elevation, of course. we are both in our 70s, and the blush of youth has fled our bodies, but i'm fit enough to wrestle a wheelchair up stairs or in and out of an uncrowded subway train.
i've already done some web research, and the stories and information i find there suggest that wheelchair travel in japan is not all that difficult. as i wrote earlier, my immediate concern is about getting from place to place not in making the visit to a sight. i still expect her to use the wheelchair for museum visits and for ""strolling"" around a street lined with shops.
we're used a wheelchair before at museums and airports and have found that they serve us well. however, those environments are very wheel-friendly. on the street i expect to encounter rough or uneven pavement, curbs, and crowds.
i'd like to focus this thread on crowds, specifically how would a crowd crossing a busy intersection deal with a wheelchair? robert w and global report that they rarely see wheelchairs in public, would japanese automatically give way to an approaching wheelchair, or would the wheelchair introduce a bit of chaos to an otherwise orderly system?
also, my original posting asked about crowds on the subway in the evening. if we go back onto the subway in the evening, what will be the best hours to travel?
by the way global, there's a part of me that enjoys confronting the difficulties of traveling in a foreign place; negotiating the tokyo subway should prove enlightening.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g298184-i861-k13530040-Wheelchair_and_the_subway-Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html,Wheelchair and the subway,BackpackerNoMore62,US,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BackpackerNoMore62?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,50,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,200,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,200,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,50,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,50.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,200,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,200,50,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,90000,"[""['comment',"", ""'learn',"", ""'much',"", ""'preparation',"", ""'september',"", ""'trip',"", ""'japan',"", ""'may',"", ""'happen',"", ""'coronavirus',"", ""'restrictions',"", ""'place',"", ""'calendar',"", ""'turn',"", ""'autumn',"", ""'stay',"", ""'tune',"", ""'research',"", ""'fuller',"", ""'description',"", ""'journey',"", ""'shape',"", ""'read',"", ""'travel',"", ""'wife',"", ""'may',"", ""'may',"", ""'wheelchair',"", ""'move',"", ""'travel',"", ""'right',"", ""'long',"", ""'walk',"", ""'set',"", ""'pain',"", ""'leg',"", ""'shoulder',"", ""'arm',"", ""'mobile',"", ""'climb',"", ""'flight',"", ""'stairs',"", ""'hop',"", ""'escalator',"", ""'wander',"", ""'beautiful',"", ""'garden',"", ""'temple',"", ""'necessary',"", ""'wed',"", ""'elevator',"", ""'elevation',"", ""'course',"", ""'70s',"", ""'blush',"", ""'youth',"", ""'flee',"", ""'body',"", ""'fit',"", ""'wrestle',"", ""'wheelchair',"", ""'stairs',"", ""'uncrowded',"", ""'subway',"", ""'train',"", ""'web',"", ""'research',"", ""'stories',"", ""'information',"", ""'wheelchair',"", ""'travel',"", ""'japan',"", ""'difficult',"", ""'write',"", ""'earlier',"", ""'immediate',"", ""'concern',"", ""'place',"", ""'place',"", ""'visit',"", ""'sight',"", ""'expect',"", ""'wheelchair',"", ""'museum',"", ""'visit',"", ""'stroll',"", ""'street',"", ""'line',"", ""'shop',"", ""'wheelchair',"", ""'museums',"", ""'airports',"", ""'serve',"", ""'environments',"", ""'wheel',"", ""'friendly',"", ""'street',"", ""'expect',"", ""'encounter',"", ""'rough',"", ""'uneven',"", ""'pavement',"", ""'curb',"", ""'crowd',"", ""'focus',"", ""'thread',"", ""'crowd',"", ""'specifically',"", ""'crowd',"", ""'cross',"", ""'busy',"", ""'intersection',"", ""'deal',"", ""'wheelchair',"", ""'robert',"", ""'w',"", ""'global',"", ""'report',"", ""'rarely',"", ""'see',"", ""'wheelchairs',"", ""'public',"", ""'japanese',"", ""'automatically',"", ""'way',"", ""'approach',"", ""'wheelchair',"", ""'wheelchair',"", ""'introduce',"", ""'chaos',"", ""'orderly',"", ""'system',"", ""'original',"", ""'post',"", ""'crowd',"", ""'subway',"", ""'onto',"", ""'subway',"", ""'hours',"", ""'travel',"", ""'way',"", ""'global',"", ""'part',"", ""'confront',"", ""'difficulties',"", ""'travel',"", ""'foreign',"", ""'place',"", ""'negotiate',"", ""'tokyo',"", ""'subway',"", ""'prove',"", ""'enlighten']""]",False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

i also enjoyed visiting the sumo wrestling stadium in tokyo. there was no wrestling, but it does have a small museum. but the real highlight was that there were plenty of actual sumo wrestlers in and around the stadium area. they were easy to recognise because they are so big, plus they were wearing traditional costumes.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g294232-i525-k13544928-2nd_time_in_Japan_unique_experiences-Japan.html,2nd time in Japan; unique experiences,EdT255060,AU,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EdT255060?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,50,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,50,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,50,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,200,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,200.0,50,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,50000,"[""['onsen',"", ""'public',"", ""'hot',"", ""'bath',"", ""'japanese',"", ""'experience',"", ""'country',"", ""'visit',"", ""'two',"", ""'one',"", ""'matsuyama',"", ""'one',"", ""'matsumoto',"", ""'dogo',"", ""'onsen',"", ""'matsuyama',"", ""'old',"", ""'fashion',"", ""'style',"", ""'build',"", ""'onsen',"", ""'modern',"", ""'build',"", ""'naked',"", ""'complete',"", ""'strangers',"", ""'genders',"", ""'separate',"", ""'visit',"", ""'sumo',"", ""'wrestle',"", ""'stadium',"", ""'tokyo',"", ""'wrestle',"", ""'small',"", ""'museum',"", ""'real',"", ""'highlight',"", ""'plenty',"", ""'actual',"", ""'sumo',"", ""'wrestlers',"", ""'stadium',"", ""'area',"", ""'easy',"", ""'recognise',"", ""'big',"", ""'plus',"", ""'wear',"", ""'traditional',"", ""'costume']""]",True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

of course it's your call to spend as many days as you want on theme parks, note that those do not offer authentic aspects of that country. while disneyland is the same in every location except for the language - (i've been to all 4 of them), consider dropping it but allocating to tokyo or kyoto where there are plenty of local spots worth visiting.
tokyo - apart from the usual spots in asakusa, ginza, shinjuku, shibuya etc,, spend a few hours in teamlabs in odaiba - plenty of videos on youtube.
hakone - visit it for a few hours while travelling enroute to kyoto. depart early from tokyo and complete the whole loop once by taking the various transports by odakyu. manage your expectations that mt fuji might not be seen in summer as mentioned. on clear days, it can be viewed along the ropeway and partially from lake ashi.

thank you for the feedback so far! our interests are temples, shrines, food, nature, some culture (e.g. tea ceremony etc.) but with young kids museums are not high on the list.
we have no budget - i am happy to pay for anything that i think is worthwhile. obviously i like good value for money.
we want to stay at least one night in a ryokan with an onsen and eat a kaiseki.

also, i was thinking to do 2 day trips from tokyo: hakone and nikko. is that too much?",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g294232-i525-k13506436-First_trip_to_Japan_advice_on_2_5_weeks_itinerary-Japan.html,First trip to Japan - advice on 2.5 weeks itinerary,Oreo-X,Switzerland,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Oreo-X?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,100,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,100,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,100,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,100,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,100,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,50000,"[""['ki',"", ""'nrt',"", ""'feedback',"", ""'far',"", ""'interest',"", ""'temples',"", ""'shrine',"", ""'food',"", ""'nature',"", ""'culture',"", ""'eg',"", ""'tea',"", ""'ceremony',"", ""'young',"", ""'kid',"", ""'museums',"", ""'high',"", ""'budget',"", ""'happy',"", ""'pay',"", ""'worthwhile',"", ""'obviously',"", ""'good',"", ""'value',"", ""'money',"", ""'stay',"", ""'least',"", ""'one',"", ""'night',"", ""'ryokan',"", ""'onsen',"", ""'eat',"", ""'kaiseki',"", ""'tip',"", ""'visit',"", ""'miyajima',"", ""'shirakawa',"", ""'read',"", ""'must',"", ""'see',"", ""'nara',"", ""'plan',"", ""'day',"", ""'trip',"", ""'overnight',"", ""'2',"", ""'day',"", ""'trip',"", ""'tokyo',"", ""'hakone',"", ""'nikko',"", ""'much']""]",False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
252,5039,JP,"vote hakone, favorite place world. stay overnight can, makes easier hot springs (for parents, kids). kids love outdoor activities.
there‘s half-day nature tour includes boat, train, cable car, etc. transit focus sounded silly, tour nice! (we didn’t kids time.) kids fun different types transport. (i “tour” it’s public transit, organized tour.)
the hakone open-air museum outdoor sculpture park (and indoor picasso section) nice way see art kids getting bored. there’s (warm?) foot bath on-site well.
we loved hotel manatei (aka club manatee) ryokan-like experience. got room private bath (+$100 usd) = private onsen overlooking trees babbling brook. worth every penny. hotel onsen rooms guests reserve, you’ll tied schedule subject availability. much easier it’s room, sneak whenever kids fall asleep, turns parent room vs going downstairs soak. (i don’t kids soak hot water, way.)
technically hotel manatei isn’t ryokan. don’t exactly makes ryokan. wanted small/local place, gave yukata (pajamas wear premises) kaiseki dinner, manatei had. dinner excellent! dinner served restaurant instead in-room, beds western (not futon tatami mats), it’s ryokan?","another vote for hakone, maybe my favorite place in the world. stay overnight if you can, which makes it easier to do hot springs (for the parents, not kids). kids will love the outdoor activities.
there‘s a half-day nature tour that includes a boat, train, cable car, etc. the transit focus sounded silly, but the tour was really nice! (we didn’t even have kids at the time.) kids will have fun with the different types of transport. (i say “tour” but actually it’s all public transit, so not like an organized tour.)
the hakone open-air museum has an outdoor sculpture park (and indoor picasso section) which is a nice way to see art without the kids getting too bored. there’s a (warm?) foot bath on-site as well.
we loved hotel manatei (aka club manatee) for a ryokan-like experience. we got a room with a private bath (+$100 usd) = private onsen overlooking trees and a babbling brook. worth every penny. the hotel also has onsen rooms that guests can reserve, but you’ll be tied to a schedule and subject to availability. much easier if it’s in your room, you can sneak in whenever the kids fall asleep, and not have to take turns with one parent in the room vs the other going downstairs to soak. (i don’t think kids like to soak in the very hot water, by the way.)
technically hotel manatei isn’t a ryokan. i don’t know exactly what makes a ryokan. for us we wanted a small/local place, that gave us yukata (pajamas to wear on the premises) and kaiseki dinner, which manatei had. and the dinner was excellent! dinner was served in the restaurant instead of in-room, and the beds were western (not futon on tatami mats), which may be why it’s not a ryokan?",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g294232-i525-k13506436-First_trip_to_Japan_advice_on_2_5_weeks_itinerary-Japan.html,First trip to Japan - advice on 2.5 weeks itinerary,Angela H,0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anhoffma?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,100,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,100,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,400,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,225,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,66875,"[""['vote',"", ""'hakone',"", ""'favorite',"", ""'place',"", ""'world',"", ""'stay',"", ""'overnight',"", ""'easier',"", ""'hot',"", ""'spring',"", ""'parent',"", ""'kid',"", ""'kid',"", ""'outdoor',"", ""'activities',"", ""'there‘s',"", ""'half',"", ""'day',"", ""'nature',"", ""'tour',"", ""'include',"", ""'boat',"", ""'train',"", ""'cable',"", ""'car',"", ""'transit',"", ""'focus',"", ""'sound',"", ""'silly',"", ""'tour',"", ""'didn’t',"", ""'kid',"", ""'time',"", ""'kid',"", ""'fun',"", ""'different',"", ""'type',"", ""'transport',"", ""'“tour”',"", ""'it’s',"", ""'public',"", ""'transit',"", ""'organize',"", ""'tour',"", ""'hakone',"", ""'open',"", ""'air',"", ""'museum',"", ""'outdoor',"", ""'sculpture',"", ""'park',"", ""'indoor',"", ""'picasso',"", ""'section',"", ""'way',"", ""'see',"", ""'art',"", ""'kid',"", ""'bore',"", ""'there’s',"", ""'warm',"", ""'foot',"", ""'bath',"", ""'site',"", ""'hotel',"", ""'manatei',"", ""'aka',"", ""'club',"", ""'manatee',"", ""'ryokan',"", ""'experience',"", ""'room',"", ""'private',"", ""'bath',"", ""'100',"", ""'usd',"", ""'private',"", ""'onsen',"", ""'overlook',"", ""'tree',"", ""'babble',"", ""'brook',"", ""'worth',"", ""'penny',"", ""'hotel',"", ""'onsen',"", ""'room',"", ""'guests',"", ""'reserve',"", ""'you’ll',"", ""'tie',"", ""'schedule',"", ""'subject',"", ""'availability',"", ""'much',"", ""'easier',"", ""'it’s',"", ""'room',"", ""'sneak',"", ""'whenever',"", ""'kid',"", ""'fall',"", ""'asleep',"", ""'turn',"", ""'one',"", ""'parent',"", ""'room',"", ""'vs',"", ""'downstairs',"", ""'soak',"", ""'don’t',"", ""'kid',"", ""'soak',"", ""'hot',"", ""'water',"", ""'way',"", ""'technically',"", ""'hotel',"", ""'manatei',"", ""'isn’t',"", ""'ryokan',"", ""'don’t',"", ""'exactly',"", ""'ryokan',"", ""'small',"", ""'local',"", ""'place',"", ""'yukata',"", ""'pajamas',"", ""'wear',"", ""'premise',"", ""'kaiseki',"", ""'dinner',"", ""'manatei',"", ""'dinner',"", ""'excellent',"", ""'dinner',"", ""'serve',"", ""'restaurant',"", ""'instead',"", ""'room',"", ""'bed',"", ""'western',"", ""'futon',"", ""'tatami',"", ""'mat',"", ""'may',"", ""'it’s',"", ""'ryokan']""]",False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

rayza","ten days is not too long. you list 10 nights in the three cities, but if you are travelling from and back to hcmc on days and 10, isn't that only 9 nights?
i suggest flying to hue and back from danang (or vice versa) to have one less 'moving day', checking in and out of accommodation - unless you already plan to go by rail one way and road the other between danang and hue.
in hue, the imperial citadel is worth a visit and with no large international tour groups around you shouldn't find it crowded. cycling is easy around the citadel and between there and thien mu pagoda in the leafy streets and garden houses of kim long. it is cooler there than the citadel and central area of the city. you can find good local food and cafes in both areas.
outside the city, distances make a motorcycle or car a better choice. it will also be very very hot in july.
some suggestions:
huyen tran princess temple. i've never seen many there. past the top building to the left are stone steps to the peace bell and good views worth the climb.
dong khanh and gia long tombs receive fewer visitors than the three tombs on most itineraries. they are all worth a visit but two or three is enough for most on one day.
thanh toan bridge, which has recently undergone restoration work, is 7km out of town through vast rice paddies. it is right beside a small market and a small rice growing museum is nearby. a relaxing place.
thuan an beach will be busy before 9 am and after 4pm and quiet in between. along the way from the city i like to stop at cho no, a riverside market. futher on you could detour a little to chuon lagoon. if you want to venture south from there - over 25km more - you'll find an bang aka city of ghosts with its hundreds of extravagant ornate tombs. there is a shorter route back via phu bai.
if you aren't renting a motorbike, a motorbike tour rider or private car driver will take to to places you request, but i can't recommend any at the moment. all the riders i've used have found new jobs. the drivers i've used were sole operators and some have had to sell their cars. others decided not to continue to register it as a business car carrying the new yellow plates. maybe they will return sometime. meanwhile, they too have other work. your hotel will probably know who is available.

by placing all hope on architecture and food it is bound to be just another competitor to china.
where is the focus on sustainability, waste control, and environmental awareness ? a building of bamboo with plants on the exterior is novel but it isn't rivetting.

if you don't want to spend that kind of money, with just two days, you can take day trips closer to tokyo. for a mt. fuji visit, head to fuji five lakes. the downside is summer is often hazy. if there is any haze, mist, clouds or rain, you won't see the mountain. spending two days there actually increases your chances of seeing the mountain. also, in july, kawaguchiko offers flower fields and a stunning lavender festival.
hakone is another mt. fuji area choice. the view overall is not as iconic as the ones from fuji five lakes but the area makes up for it with cable car and boat rides, a volcanic valley with steam, and some interesting themed museums.
both hakone and fuji five lakes have plenty of onsen ryokans if you are interested. you can also try some of them as a day tripper just for a quick soak.
for a smaller version of ""kyoto,"" kamakura has historically significant temples and shrines. the trip is often combined with enoshima which offers coastal views.

mc","thank you daisy, and everyone else who replied, you have all been really helpful and i appreciate that a lot.
i have decided that i will book everything myself as it would be miles cheaper, but will wait to have a vaccine and new announcements about travel possibilities.
one thing i am really interested in is historic japanese cars (weird, i know!) so i will certainly be looking for honda and toyota museums in jpn.
i do worry about racism as i don’t know how the japanese people will react to my ethnicity/ religion etc, but i can only hope that they will be respectful.
thank you friends, you are all wonderful people.

edited: 3:41 pm, january 01,","im working on a rough outline of a 3 week itinerary for our first visit to japan, that is bound by set dates at the beginning and toward the end of the trip. the set dates are a sumo wrestling tournament in osaka on mar 28 and the takayama spring festival on apr 14. my husband and i have traveled extensively in asia, but never to japan. we generally prefer to have off the beaten path experiences that highlight natural beauty and culture, and that are combined with visits to must see tourist places. we are not really into big cities. im looking at visiting the following locations, and need advice on how to order the locations to minimize travel times, and also advice on # of full days at a location.
tokyo (fly in and out), perhaps spend one day at the end of the trip before flight home
osaka - 2 days
kyoto - 4 days
shikoku island - 4 days
kanazawa, takayama, shirakawa-go - 2-3 days
izu peninsula - 3-4 days
?? yakushima island - 2-3 days (would love to see the natural beauty of this island. my husband is 74 and i'm 59 and we are in decent physical shape. but with some surgeries we've had, now limit hiking to about 2 miles. would we miss out on what the island offers if we can't do the longer hikes?)
? hakone - 1 day (like the open air museum, but dont know if a stop here makes sense given the other places we are seeing.

thank help!","hi all,
so, should we be allowed into the country (we will be fully vaccinated by then but who can tell), my partner and i are planning a 3-week trip to japan for october 2021 (all of the below assumes relative normalcy, backup plan is us west coast if not, with this one then being parked until we can get over to japan).
neither of us have been before (in fact we haven't been further east than istanbul) and we may not be back for a long time. we also haven't been anywhere since nov 2019, so keen to make it a good one!
essential elements for the trip are:
guinea pig bridge (nagasaki bio park)
whale sharks (okinawa chaurami aquarium)
disneyland + disneysea (no weekends)
usj + halloween horror nights (no weekends)
studio ghibli museum
kobe beef (heavy preference for in kobe)
time-based events we would like to see (happy to take advice on what is ""worth it"" or may compromise seeing the rest of the towns in question):
yokohama oktoberfest, 3rd-19th
nagasaki festival, 7th-9th
onomichi lantern festival, 9th
takayama festival, 9th (though can't fit this in at present)
okinawa tug of war festival, 10th
himeji ""fighting"" festival, 15th
kurama fire festival, 22nd
less-specific goals:
visit all 4 major islands (+ okinawa)
see the autumn leaves (probably hokkaido due to dates)
see mt fuji (aware climbing is out)
see major sights of tokyo, kyoto, osaka
see as many other cultural sights as possible
shopping for retro video games/gear (i import and sell this stuff, so may as well pick some up while there if possible)
relevant interests:
animals (esp. sealife and small furry things)
scenic views
volcanoes, caves, other interesting geology
world war ii history
food (esp. seafood)
anime (esp. studio ghibli, nge, jba)
video games (esp. nintendo)
planes, trains (we work in those industries)
flight prices mean we can practically only have endpoints at tokyo and osaka (essentially tokyo), and we plan to arrive (from the uk) on the evening of 3rd oct, departing late in the evening of 23rd oct. travel in between will be primarily by train (shinkansen/sunrise express mostly), taking advantage of the okinawa flights to get to hokkaido and avoid one long train leg.
potential itinerary options are below - a lot is common so i've just noted the major of variations to avoid repetition. any comments please?

n.b. i know these are packed - that's the idea. ""impossible"" is eating the sun, ""very difficult"" is something i can live with :) but would appreciate pointers on when stretching things is likely to hit breaking point and if there are things that are not going to be worth the effort (more time in tokyo would be nice)!
i have found 0.5/1/2 day itineraries online for all noted places so hopefully ok there. trips i've already done for reference (so the below are all possible, as a yardstick):
vienna-bratislava-budapest-prague-krakow in 5 days by rail

it's been a long time since i've visited japan, was an english teacher there for a couple years in mie prefecture (2014 - 2016). i've been wanting to bring my fiance their to give her a bit of my experience, and have been planning a trip back for some time. i wanted to get out to areas i didn't get to visit while there, but also hit up some of the major tourist attractions for her, and was curious if we may be moving too fast over the course of the trip. i took inspiration from the hokuriku arch pass guide from japan-guide.com here:

this is a rough guide to what i've planned out, and have friends i'll be staying with in both tokyo and nagoya. everywhere else we'll be staying at ryokan, or hotels.

any thoughts on this? have i planned too much? also if anyone has any advice on booking tickets now, or when would be an opportune time to wait. tickets right now during that time period are around $570 - 600 round trip, and would love to book, but expect things may not improve in japan by then.

overall, (or if) findings accessible public; meantime, useful, traveler passes maros, aware area fundamental episode mankind's initial march towards settlement whole planet witnessed.","
in addition to the reasons of interest for the discovery, mentioned in the bbc article, at least one more can be mentioned.
the huge sulawesi island (formerly known as celebes), place of the findings, and of which the greatest reason for notoriety is probably given by the singular funerary customs of the toraja population, is part of the archipelagic complex called by paleontologists ""wallacea"", of interest as used by the first men to make the long amphibious journey from continental asia to what will finally be the first settlement of oceania (where, as is well known, humanity landed long before the americas).
moreover, the finds of hominids that have not left graphic traces are much older in sulawesi, up to well over 100,000 years ago.
the newspapers that have reported the news so far, regarding the location of the caves decorated with drawings, and in particular of the most cited, the leang tedongnge cave, about the locatin just inform that it's in the south of sulawesi, and ""at least an hour walk from the nearest carriage road"" (which actually doesn't seem much to me).
however, better information on the location can be obtained from the map which is on page 2 of the article that gave the scientific information on the findings

from such map it's clear that the caves are located on the east-northeast of the city of maros, at a distance of at least 20 kms.
overall, we don't know when (or even if) these findings will be accessible to the public; but in the meantime, it's useful, for the traveler who is in or passes through maros, to be aware that in the area a fundamental episode of mankind's initial march towards the settlement of the whole planet is witnessed.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g3365789-i50383-k13469984-The_oldest_known_animals_drafts_discovered_near_Maros-Maros_South_Sulawesi_Sulawesi.html,The oldest known animals' drafts discovered near Maros,Brun066,IT,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Brun066?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,100,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,100,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,100,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,100,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,40000,"[""['addition',"", ""'reason',"", ""'interest',"", ""'discovery',"", ""'bbc',"", ""'article',"", ""'least',"", ""'one',"", ""'huge',"", ""'sulawesi',"", ""'island',"", ""'formerly',"", ""'celebes',"", ""'place',"", ""'greatest',"", ""'reason',"", ""'notoriety',"", ""'singular',"", ""'funerary',"", ""'customs',"", ""'toraja',"", ""'population',"", ""'part',"", ""'archipelagic',"", ""'complex',"", ""'call',"", ""'paleontologists',"", ""'wallacea',"", ""'interest',"", ""'men',"", ""'long',"", ""'amphibious',"", ""'journey',"", ""'continental',"", ""'asia',"", ""'finally',"", ""'settlement',"", ""'oceania',"", ""'humanity',"", ""'land',"", ""'long',"", ""'americas',"", ""'moreover',"", ""'hominids',"", ""'graphic',"", ""'trace',"", ""'much',"", ""'older',"", ""'sulawesi',"", ""'100000',"", ""'newspapers',"", ""'report',"", ""'news',"", ""'far',"", ""'location',"", ""'cave',"", ""'decorate',"", ""'draw',"", ""'particular',"", ""'cite',"", ""'leang',"", ""'tedongnge',"", ""'cave',"", ""'locatin',"", ""'inform',"", ""'south',"", ""'sulawesi',"", ""'least',"", ""'hour',"", ""'walk',"", ""'nearest',"", ""'carriage',"", ""'road',"", ""'much',"", ""'information',"", ""'location',"", ""'obtain',"", ""'map',"", ""'page',"", ""'2',"", ""'article',"", ""'scientific',"", ""'information',"", ""'map',"", ""'clear',"", ""'cave',"", ""'locate',"", ""'east',"", ""'northeast',"", ""'city',"", ""'maros',"", ""'distance',"", ""'least',"", ""'20',"", ""'kms',"", ""'overall',"", ""'accessible',"", ""'public',"", ""'meantime',"", ""'useful',"", ""'traveler',"", ""'pass',"", ""'maros',"", ""'aware',"", ""'area',"", ""'fundamental',"", ""'episode',"", ""'mankinds',"", ""'initial',"", ""'march',"", ""'settlement',"", ""'whole',"", ""'planet',"", ""'witness']""]",False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

not counting my hotels ..is $3000 ok for 3 weeks ? just for shopping and food? no rail ticket? cutting it fine, but think you could do it. second time there, yes defiently u could :) hehe",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g298184-i861-k13455876-First_time_overwhelmed_no_idea_3_weeks_budget-Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html,First time overwhelmed..no idea 3 weeks budget,Wayan S,US,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CountSamuel?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,100,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,100,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,100,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,30000,"[""['no1',"", ""'hot',"", ""'humid',"", ""'no2',"", ""'latin',"", ""'alphabet',"", ""'much',"", ""'no3',"", ""'walk',"", ""'fair',"", ""'fam',"", ""'walk',"", ""'home',"", ""'walk',"", ""'everywhere',"", ""'japan',"", ""'no4',"", ""'1',"", ""'per',"", ""'person',"", ""'no5',"", ""'umm',"", ""'no6',"", ""'totally',"", ""'safe',"", ""'no7',"", ""'taxi',"", ""'experience',"", ""'work',"", ""'cheaper',"", ""'time',"", ""'wrong',"", ""'no8',"", ""'guess',"", ""'try',"", ""'no9',"", ""'theme',"", ""'park',"", ""'fuji',"", ""'q',"", ""'way',"", ""'rid',"", ""'close',"", ""'due',"", ""'low',"", ""'wind',"", ""'def',"", ""'rollercoaster',"", ""'tokyo',"", ""'dome',"", ""'worth',"", ""'no10',"", ""'good',"", ""'question',"", ""'visit',"", ""'no11',"", ""'much',"", ""'walk',"", ""'walk',"", ""'areas',"", ""'train',"", ""'area',"", ""'no12',"", ""'skytree',"", ""'bulilding',"", ""'tokyo',"", ""'dome',"", ""'buiilding',"", ""'good',"", ""'harajuku',"", ""'omotesando',"", ""'shibuya',"", ""'area',"", ""'shop',"", ""'basically',"", ""'wasnt',"", ""'much',"", ""'difference',"", ""'osaka',"", ""'easier',"", ""'shop',"", ""'count',"", ""'hotels',"", ""'3000',"", ""'3',"", ""'weeks',"", ""'shop',"", ""'food',"", ""'rail',"", ""'ticket',"", ""'cut',"", ""'fine',"", ""'second',"", ""'time',"", ""'defiently']""]",False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

where planning overnight - hiroshima miyajima?
i agree bargainhunter, plenty see hiroshima: addition peace museum, miss shukkei-en garden surrounding art museum there, mitaki-dera.
same miyajima, tourist street shops plenty see besides obvious, hike mt misen, definitely miss daisho-in.
we hate one-nighters bargainhunter says choose stay nights minimum prefer wherever visit.
so yes, dr says, done, it? no.

""we would be overnighting spending the whole next day and spend that night as well.""
where are you planning to overnight - hiroshima or miyajima?
i agree with bargainhunter, there is plenty to see in hiroshima: in addition to the peace museum, you shouldn't miss shukkei-en garden surrounding the art museum there, and mitaki-dera.
same for miyajima, once you get off the tourist street of shops there is plenty to see besides the obvious, you can hike up mt misen, and you definitely shouldn't miss daisho-in.
we too hate one-nighters as bargainhunter says and we choose to stay 2 nights at the very minimum but prefer 3 or more wherever we visit.
so yes, as dr s says, it can be done, would we do it? no.

(by the way, in dublin, be sure to visit the epic irish emigration museum. it's a fascinating look at the irish diaspora, and if you have irish ancestors, you can make an appointment to have someone help you research them.)

4. day 4: explore edinburgh, course including royal mile edinburgh castle. visit arthur’s seat kids? not, suggestion (not keen visiting museums)? return train catch edinburgh station pm. suggestions spend day edinburgh appreciated.","thanks everybody for your suggestions. after going through them and doing my own research, i changed my mind a little and came up with the below plan. we will be staying 3d2n in glasgow and 1n1d in edinburgh.
we could not consider a timberbush tour as their tours are cancelled on the days we’ll be in glasgow. could you please review the plan and let me know your suggestions?
1. day 1: we will be reaching glasgow at around 2 pm. is it possible to cover loch lomond and trossachs national park with public transport during rest of the day? i found we can take the train to balloch and get into sweeny’s cruise for a circular tour of loch lomond. but what about trossachs national park? is its entrance also near balloch station? are we better off going by bus if we plan to cover both? please advise.
2. day 2: day return trip by train from glasgow to mallaig via fort william. i know we will spend 10+ hours in train, but we find the opportunity to experience one of the most scenic routes in the world hard to resist. besides the kids also love train ride, so i believe they will not complain.
3. day 3: this is where i am still undecided. this will be our last day in glasgow and we’re considering a day trip to one of these locations by public transport: isle of arran/ayrshire coast/stirling castle/oban/inverness/st andrews. which one of these do you suggest we should go assuming we will never visit scotland again? :-). we should be ok as long as we return to glasgow by 9 pm. will take the next train to edinburgh that night.
4. day 4: explore edinburgh, of course including the royal mile and edinburgh castle. do you think we can visit arthur’s seat too with the kids? if not, any other suggestion (not too keen on visiting museums)? we have a return train to catch from edinburgh station at around 6 pm. so any suggestions to spend the day in edinburgh will be appreciated.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g186485-i107-k13636655-4_days_in_Scotland_with_kids_and_no_car-Scotland.html,4 days in Scotland with kids and no car,Tansen378,The Royal Town of...,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tansen378?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,50,0,0,0.0,0,200,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,50,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,50,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,50,0,0,0,200,50,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,52500,"[""['everybody',"", ""'suggestions',"", ""'research',"", ""'mind',"", ""'little',"", ""'plan',"", ""'stay',"", ""'3d2n',"", ""'glasgow',"", ""'1n1d',"", ""'edinburgh',"", ""'timberbush',"", ""'tour',"", ""'tour',"", ""'cancel',"", ""'days',"", ""'we’ll',"", ""'glasgow',"", ""'plan',"", ""'suggestions',"", ""'1',"", ""'day',"", ""'1',"", ""'reach',"", ""'glasgow',"", ""'2',"", ""'cover',"", ""'loch',"", ""'lomond',"", ""'trossachs',"", ""'national',"", ""'park',"", ""'public',"", ""'transport',"", ""'rest',"", ""'day',"", ""'train',"", ""'balloch',"", ""'sweeny’s',"", ""'cruise',"", ""'circular',"", ""'tour',"", ""'loch',"", ""'lomond',"", ""'trossachs',"", ""'national',"", ""'park',"", ""'entrance',"", ""'near',"", ""'balloch',"", ""'station',"", ""'bus',"", ""'plan',"", ""'cover',"", ""'2',"", ""'day',"", ""'2',"", ""'day',"", ""'trip',"", ""'train',"", ""'glasgow',"", ""'mallaig',"", ""'via',"", ""'fort',"", ""'william',"", ""'spend',"", ""'10',"", ""'hours',"", ""'train',"", ""'opportunity',"", ""'experience',"", ""'one',"", ""'scenic',"", ""'rout',"", ""'world',"", ""'hard',"", ""'resist',"", ""'besides',"", ""'kid',"", ""'train',"", ""'ride',"", ""'complain',"", ""'3',"", ""'day',"", ""'3',"", ""'undecided',"", ""'day',"", ""'glasgow',"", ""'we’re',"", ""'day',"", ""'trip',"", ""'one',"", ""'locations',"", ""'public',"", ""'transport',"", ""'isle',"", ""'arran',"", ""'ayrshire',"", ""'coast',"", ""'stirling',"", ""'castle',"", ""'oban',"", ""'inverness',"", ""'st',"", ""'andrews',"", ""'one',"", ""'assume',"", ""'visit',"", ""'scotland',"", ""'long',"", ""'glasgow',"", ""'9',"", ""'train',"", ""'edinburgh',"", ""'night',"", ""'4',"", ""'day',"", ""'4',"", ""'explore',"", ""'edinburgh',"", ""'course',"", ""'include',"", ""'royal',"", ""'mile',"", ""'edinburgh',"", ""'castle',"", ""'visit',"", ""'arthur’s',"", ""'seat',"", ""'kid',"", ""'suggestion',"", ""'keen',"", ""'visit',"", ""'museums',"", ""'train',"", ""'catch',"", ""'edinburgh',"", ""'station',"", ""'6',"", ""'suggestions',"", ""'spend',"", ""'day',"", ""'edinburgh']""]",True,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

edited: 7:44 pm, april 08,","three nights is only two full days in cornwall. as you are staying in marazion you will have enough to do in that area to fill your days. one day could be on the lizard visiting cadgwith, lizard village and kynance cove - great pasties from ann’s bakery in lizard village. the other day could be newlyn, mousehole, sennen (walk to land’s end from there and you will miss the worst of the tacky theme park although that is closed), then cape cornwall and botallack with its iconic mine buildings (this area in my opinion is far more atmospheric and interesting than land’s end).
if you choose to go to st ives, don’t try to drive in the old part of the town. you can park at the leisure centre and either walk or take the bus into the town i usually recommend the park and ride for an amazing train journey but public transport is still to be avoided unless necessary.
for your journey towards cornwall you could either spend time on dartmoor as suggested above or visit the lost gardens of heligan but that must be prebooked.
you will be able to see st michael’s mount from marazion but the island is closed to visitors.
as mentioned previously some of the roads in cornwall are very narrow with passing places so reversing may be required if you meet someone. don’t try to drive into the old harbour villages:cadgwith, mousehole, port isaac etc as they were built before cars were invented.

","dumfries & galloway is due to move into level 1 restrictions on 5 june which in theory means many places should be able to open for visitors however best to check in advance in case booking is required.
if your car is being serviced you may just want to have a walk around by the river nith - the burns visitor centre is on the far side from the town, accessible by a suspension footbridge or an old stone footbridge alongside the weir. the centre has a bistro - now called the jaggy thistle. i've not visited recently so don't know how this most recent incarnation fares. there is the the cavens arms within walking distance on buccleuch street which does bar meals. the edenbank hotel on the far side of the river and up the hill from the stone bridge crossing usually does a nice meal. (you would need to have directions to find it as it is tucked away in a residential area).

we planning four-day stay london, going free museums. last three days going passes.","i've been going back and forth on here and elsewhere on the internet trying to make sense of the oyster travelcard that can be added to the london pass.
initially we thought that it was an unlimited travel pass, but no, it has limits. a three-day travelcard comes with a 25 pound credit, and the site says, as an example, that there's a capped daily limit for zones 1 - 2 of 7 pounds. then after we've exceeded the cap it's all free! so do i take it that as long as we stay in zones 1 - 2 we can go back and forth as much as we please on the transport system and all that will be deducted per day from our running total of 25 pounds will be 7 pounds? if we do that for the first two days there'll be 11 pounds left on day three, and as we'd planned on starting out the day by going out to hampton court palace, which is in zone 6, we'll get charged 12.80 pounds, which would mean having to top up the card by 1.80 - or whatever the minimum increment is - to make it work? does it mean we can still go back and forth in zones 1 - 2 for the day once we get back from hampton court?
we're trying to figure out our best options, particularly as we'll actually be in london for four days, not three. the first day we were going to focus on the free museums and wear the cost directly for the 2 - 3 trains we'll likely catch getting about, then use the london pass and associated travelcard for the next three days.
we were planning on a four-day stay in london, the first of which was going to take in the free museums. then for the last three days we were going to use the passes.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g186216-i15-k13510094-London_Pass_Travel_Card-United_Kingdom.html,London Pass + Travel Card,Stephen B,US,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Road46540944189?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,300,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,134,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,134,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,47956,"[""['forth',"", ""'elsewhere',"", ""'internet',"", ""'try',"", ""'sense',"", ""'oyster',"", ""'travelcard',"", ""'add',"", ""'london',"", ""'pass',"", ""'initially',"", ""'unlimited',"", ""'travel',"", ""'pass',"", ""'limit',"", ""'three',"", ""'day',"", ""'travelcard',"", ""'25',"", ""'pound',"", ""'credit',"", ""'site',"", ""'example',"", ""'cap',"", ""'daily',"", ""'limit',"", ""'zone',"", ""'1',"", ""'2',"", ""'7',"", ""'pound',"", ""'exceed',"", ""'cap',"", ""'free',"", ""'long',"", ""'stay',"", ""'zone',"", ""'1',"", ""'2',"", ""'forth',"", ""'much',"", ""'transport',"", ""'system',"", ""'deduct',"", ""'per',"", ""'day',"", ""'run',"", ""'total',"", ""'25',"", ""'pound',"", ""'7',"", ""'pound',"", ""'two',"", ""'days',"", ""'therell',"", ""'11',"", ""'pound',"", ""'day',"", ""'three',"", ""'wed',"", ""'plan',"", ""'start',"", ""'day',"", ""'hampton',"", ""'court',"", ""'palace',"", ""'zone',"", ""'6',"", ""'charge',"", ""'1280',"", ""'pound',"", ""'top',"", ""'card',"", ""'180',"", ""'whatever',"", ""'minimum',"", ""'increment',"", ""'work',"", ""'forth',"", ""'zone',"", ""'1',"", ""'2',"", ""'day',"", ""'hampton',"", ""'court',"", ""'try',"", ""'figure',"", ""'options',"", ""'particularly',"", ""'london',"", ""'four',"", ""'days',"", ""'three',"", ""'day',"", ""'focus',"", ""'free',"", ""'museums',"", ""'wear',"", ""'cost',"", ""'directly',"", ""'2',"", ""'3',"", ""'train',"", ""'catch',"", ""'london',"", ""'pass',"", ""'associate',"", ""'travelcard',"", ""'three',"", ""'days',"", ""'plan',"", ""'four',"", ""'day',"", ""'stay',"", ""'london',"", ""'free',"", ""'museums',"", ""'three',"", ""'days',"", ""'pass']""]",False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
330,5213,UK,"hunted everywhere trying answer travel card, nothing seemed clearly answer question daily limits work - questions options public transport london. wife kept getting thrown point reaching daily limit, free - kept reading saying unlimited pass, point charging pounds zones - 2, example? finally figured (i think!) wording could familiar system.
also, judging answers, people making assumptions, misunderstood wording post - ever asking answers pertaining travel card. lived london early 80's (well oyster cards came along) twice then. wife lived uk, time we'll going together. case going familiar territory - hampton court palace, reason never got seeing before. pretty familiar everything list, basically visiting old friends - i've tower three times, example, 80's, i've taken children london subsequent visits.
in case london pass work well visit need dwell interminably places tower, done before, british museum, 'greatest hits' visit old time's sake, rosetta stone elgian marbles.
i've totaled individual ticket prices come considerably cost london pass, case well worth it, throw bonuses otherwise considered. i'm tower point crossing tower bridge i'm area, london pass we'll opportunity climb across glass-floored walkways, something ordinarily considered. shard opened last visit london, student architecture (i visited burj khalifa 18 months ago) visited london pass, pass save 30 pounds ticket, considerable amount given 3-day london pass (with current discount) comes 113 pounds. we've london planning mixing novelty time movie sites, abbey road, lords cricket ground museum, - i'm twisting wife's arm add day visit time side things.
judging number posts i've seen forum, seems fashionable among scorn london pass actual fact represents good value, used judiciously. unlike places paris, london offers plethora world-class (and time consuming) museums free, looking value money day two spent getting way (or last) using london pass save sites, work well. tower, westminster abbey, st. paul's, hampton court palace, shard five main sites london total cost visit separately cost 3-day london pass. throw sites cruise thames, windsor, kensington palace, tower bridge, greenwich, globe, london zoo, etc, well sundry bonuses movie tickets guided walking tours, there's considerable value pass morning mid evening, course able see places mentioned three days unless pushed extremes! case well apply going overboard trying squeeze max allowed. case there's 400 pound limit three-day pass, total we've planned comes 320 pounds. bad pass comes third price.
our planned trip involves four-day stay london five days paris, score i'd exact opposite latter, equivalent pass paris gives user next value comes bread butter places visitors want see - value comes extras thrown wine-tasting, perfume museum, on, places people ordinarily consider visit. paris much value skip paris pass buy far less costly paris museum pass - said, unlike london sites paris free, rare exceptions places sacre couer pere lachaise cemetery.
the passes homework overboard greedy planning use. recently got visit egypt offer cairo pass luxor pass, they're brilliant value (when find - almost state secret trying buy them!) cairo's appalling traffic harder best value cairo pass. shines entitles bearer buy luxor premium pass 50% face value ($100 instead $200) almost steal considers visiting amazing tombs nefertari seti normally comes $50 - pass visit often within three-day limit. throw karnak, luxor temple, tombs valley kings, two passes represent value.
edited: 1:13 pm, march 26,","actually i hunted around everywhere on here trying to get the answer for the travel card, but nothing seemed to clearly answer the question on how the daily limits work - most of the questions were about which options to use for public transport around london. both my wife and i kept getting thrown off by the point about reaching a daily limit, after which it's free - to me it kept reading like they were saying it was an unlimited pass, so why the point about charging 7 pounds for zones 1 - 2, as an example? we finally figured it out (i think!) but the wording could be better for those not familiar with the system.
also, judging from some of the answers, people are making assumptions, or misunderstood the wording of my post - i was only ever asking for answers pertaining to the travel card. i lived in london back in the early 80's (well before the oyster cards came along) and have been back twice since then. my wife has also lived in the uk, though this will be the first time we'll be going there together. so for us this will be a case of going over familiar territory - other than hampton court palace, which for some reason or another i never got around to seeing before. so we are pretty familiar with everything on our list, and are basically visiting them as old friends - i've been to the tower three times, as an example, once on my own in the 80's, and again when i've taken each of our children to london on subsequent visits.
in our case the london pass work out well for this visit as we don't need to dwell interminably at places like the tower, having done it before, nor the british museum, but can just do a 'greatest hits' visit for old time's sake, like the rosetta stone and the elgian marbles.
i've already totaled up the individual ticket prices and they come to considerably more than the cost of the london pass, so in our case it's well worth it, and it does throw in some bonuses that i otherwise wouldn't have considered. when i'm at the tower i always make a point of crossing tower bridge while i'm in the area, but with the london pass we'll get the opportunity to actually climb up and go across the glass-floored walkways, something which i ordinarily wouldn't have considered. the shard has also opened since my last visit to london, and as a student of architecture (i visited the burj khalifa about 18 months ago) i would have visited it with or without the london pass, but with the pass i save over 30 pounds on the ticket, which is a considerable amount given that a 3-day london pass (with the current discount) comes in at 113 pounds. because we've been to london before i was also planning on mixing in a few novelty things this time around like a few movie sites, abbey road, lords cricket ground museum, etc - i'm actually twisting my wife's arm to add another day to our visit to give us more time for that side of things.
judging from a number of posts i've seen in this forum, it seems to be fashionable among some to scorn the london pass when in actual fact it represents good value, especially if used judiciously. unlike places like paris, london offers up a plethora of world-class (and time consuming) museums that are free, and for those looking to get value for money a day or two spent getting those out of the way first (or last) then using the london pass to save on other sites, would work out well. the tower, westminster abbey, st. paul's, hampton court palace, and the shard are but five main sites around london that in total would cost more to visit separately then the cost of the 3-day london pass. throw in other sites such as a cruise on the thames, windsor, kensington palace, tower bridge, greenwich, the globe, london zoo, etc, as well as sundry bonuses such as movie tickets and guided walking tours, and there's considerable value to be had from the pass from morning through to mid evening, though of course you wouldn't be able to see all the places i just mentioned in three days unless you pushed to extremes! it's just a case of how well you apply it without going overboard trying to squeeze it to the max allowed. in our case there's a 400 pound limit on a three-day pass, and our total on the things we've planned for comes in at around 320 pounds. not bad on a pass that comes in at about a third of the price.
our planned trip involves a four-day stay in london and five days in paris, and on that score i'd say the exact opposite for the latter, as the equivalent pass for paris gives the user next to no value at all when it comes to the bread and butter places most visitors want to see - its only value comes with all the extras thrown in for things like wine-tasting, a perfume museum, and so on, places that people wouldn't ordinarily consider for a visit. for paris it's much better value to skip the paris pass and just buy the far less costly paris museum pass - as i said, unlike london very few sites in paris are free, with the rare exceptions being places such as sacre couer and pere lachaise cemetery.
the thing with passes is to just do your homework and not go overboard and greedy in planning for their use. i only recently got back from a visit to egypt where they offer a cairo pass and a luxor pass, and they're brilliant value (when you can find them - it's almost like a state secret trying to buy them!) though with cairo's appalling traffic it's harder to get the best value out of the cairo pass. where it really shines though is that it entitles the bearer to buy the luxor premium pass at 50% of the face value ($100 instead of $200) which is almost a steal when one considers that visiting the amazing tombs of nefertari and seti i normally comes in at $50 each - and with the pass you can visit them as often as you like within the three-day limit. throw in karnak, luxor temple, the other tombs in the valley of the kings, etc and the two passes represent great value.

i hope you both have some ideas on what you like or dont? i usually start there and its worked for me. and i usually follow my likes/dislikes unless there is some reason to not to.

whatever the effects of covidhiatus, they are not permanent. as tourist numbers increase, so the zoos will attempt to regenerate business - and will need an assured endless supply of cubs.
the coup in burma has also increased to chances for poachers and smugglers.
there is at present a chance for the thai authorities to step in and prevent a resurgence of this sordid trade....unfortunately it seems they don't have the will or even the knowledge to deal with it.

you thailand forum goes saying cut kl penang worth visit sticking two countries easier got half country wish list.
i going itinery advance search box /youtube cn find enough getting general advice simplify trip.","so a european equivalent trip would be taking in athens, dubrovnik, rome maybe taking in venice and florence ending up in barcelona and perhaps ibiza and taking in a beach en route plus a zoo !
well you could do the european one with an under 26 rail rover pass sleeping on the trains but you fail the age class and likewise your asian adventure will have you spending many a happy hour in departure lounges and cities. -
in a nutshell i think you are trying to do too much but suggest you go on skyscanner and air asia websites to see who flies where although with the current situation we don't know when if ever anything like precovid travel will be permitted and althouth the uk will be vaccinated up by say august i doubt laos will be by the end of this year and thailand may if they are lucky have 60% vaccinated this year.
you are on the thailand forum so it goes without saying i would suggest you cut out kl and penang although both are worth a visit just sticking to two countries will make it easier and again you have got half the country on your wish list.
i am not going to suggest an itinery as if you use the advance search box /youtube you cn find out more than enough on getting around but my general advice is simplify your trip.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g293915-i3686-k13496214-Laos_Malaysia_Thailand_for_3_weeks_in_Jan_Feb_2022-Thailand.html,"Laos, Malaysia & Thailand for 3 weeks in Jan/Feb 2022",Sampag1ta,PH,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sampag1ta?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,50,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,50,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,200,0,0.0,0.0,50,50,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,30000,"[""['european',"", ""'equivalent',"", ""'trip',"", ""'athens',"", ""'dubrovnik',"", ""'rome',"", ""'venice',"", ""'florence',"", ""'end',"", ""'barcelona',"", ""'ibiza',"", ""'beach',"", ""'en',"", ""'route',"", ""'plus',"", ""'zoo',"", ""'european',"", ""'one',"", ""'26',"", ""'rail',"", ""'rover',"", ""'pass',"", ""'sleep',"", ""'train',"", ""'fail',"", ""'age',"", ""'class',"", ""'likewise',"", ""'asian',"", ""'adventure',"", ""'spend',"", ""'many',"", ""'happy',"", ""'hour',"", ""'departure',"", ""'lounge',"", ""'cities',"", ""'nutshell',"", ""'try',"", ""'much',"", ""'skyscanner',"", ""'air',"", ""'asia',"", ""'websites',"", ""'see',"", ""'fly',"", ""'current',"", ""'situation',"", ""'ever',"", ""'precovid',"", ""'travel',"", ""'permit',"", ""'althouth',"", ""'uk',"", ""'vaccinate',"", ""'august',"", ""'doubt',"", ""'laos',"", ""'end',"", ""'thailand',"", ""'may',"", ""'lucky',"", ""'60',"", ""'vaccinate',"", ""'thailand',"", ""'forum',"", ""'cut',"", ""'kl',"", ""'penang',"", ""'worth',"", ""'visit',"", ""'stick',"", ""'two',"", ""'countries',"", ""'easier',"", ""'half',"", ""'country',"", ""'wish',"", ""'itinery',"", ""'advance',"", ""'search',"", ""'box',"", ""'youtube',"", ""'cn',"", ""'general',"", ""'advice',"", ""'simplify',"", ""'trip']""]",False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
