0,102,UAE,"spec, can't see past madinat dubai stay. middle east sure.
for short stay, normally szr world trade centre business bay central gets age range, jumeirah cluster hotels close mall emirates best fit round (disney style 'souk', waterpark, lots restaurants, bars beach too).
al maha desert wonderful allow children (i pretty sure) bab al shams - nice pool mini golf kids activities. desert resorts outside dubai rak ad quite long drives (qasr al sarab set wonderful dunes quite breathtaking) table.
shout need recommendations desert (a nice private bbq away crowds suggestion) private city tour? used organise events city contacts help out. blast!","for that spec, i can't really see past madinat for the dubai stay. you'll know you are in the middle east for sure.
for a short stay, i would normally suggest the szr from world trade centre to business bay as its about as central as it gets but i think for your age range, the jumeirah cluster of hotels close to mall of the emirates might be the best fit all round (disney style 'souk', waterpark, lots of restaurants, bars and its own beach too).
al maha in the desert is wonderful but they don't allow children (i am pretty sure) but bab al shams do - nice pool and they have mini golf and other kids activities. there are other desert resorts outside of dubai in rak and ad but they are quite long drives (qasr al sarab is set in wonderful dunes and is quite breathtaking) which might mean they are off the table.
shout if you need recommendations for desert (a nice private bbq away from the crowds would be my suggestion) and maybe a private city tour? used to organise events in the city so still have a few contacts that can help out. you'll have a blast!",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g295424-i872-k13523452-Itinerary_thoughts_suggestions-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html,Itinerary thoughts & suggestions,Sean R,UK,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/275seanr?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,50,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,50,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,50,0,0,0,0,0.0,50,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,50,0,0,200,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,200,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,50,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,55000,"[""['spec',"", ""'see',"", ""'past',"", ""'madinat',"", ""'dubai',"", ""'stay',"", ""'middle',"", ""'east',"", ""'short',"", ""'stay',"", ""'normally',"", ""'szr',"", ""'world',"", ""'trade',"", ""'centre',"", ""'business',"", ""'bay',"", ""'central',"", ""'age',"", ""'range',"", ""'jumeirah',"", ""'cluster',"", ""'hotels',"", ""'close',"", ""'mall',"", ""'emirates',"", ""'fit',"", ""'round',"", ""'disney',"", ""'style',"", ""'souk',"", ""'waterpark',"", ""'lot',"", ""'restaurants',"", ""'bar',"", ""'beach',"", ""'al',"", ""'maha',"", ""'desert',"", ""'wonderful',"", ""'allow',"", ""'children',"", ""'pretty',"", ""'bab',"", ""'al',"", ""'sham',"", ""'pool',"", ""'mini',"", ""'golf',"", ""'kid',"", ""'activities',"", ""'desert',"", ""'resort',"", ""'outside',"", ""'dubai',"", ""'rak',"", ""'ad',"", ""'quite',"", ""'long',"", ""'drive',"", ""'qasr',"", ""'al',"", ""'sarab',"", ""'set',"", ""'wonderful',"", ""'dun',"", ""'quite',"", ""'breathtaking',"", ""'table',"", ""'shout',"", ""'recommendations',"", ""'desert',"", ""'private',"", ""'bbq',"", ""'away',"", ""'crowd',"", ""'suggestion',"", ""'private',"", ""'city',"", ""'tour',"", ""'organise',"", ""'events',"", ""'city',"", ""'contact',"", ""'help',"", ""'blast']""]",False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,True,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

unless you're a train buff, i would take the car. the driving route follows the train route pretty much in terms of views but has the advantage of allowing you to stop and enjoy so much lovely scenery on route.
neptune's staircase is worth time if the views to the ben are clear as you get some really fine views of it from the canal.


the glenfinnan viaduct - there is a walking route to take you nearer it if of interest. great spot though you won't be alone in peak season.

my favourite views around glenfinnan are from the hotel itself (good for lunch as mentioned) and also from the beautiful st finnan's church nearby.


loch nan uamh has bonnie prince charlie connections too (similar to glenfinnan) - it's a beautiful sea loch with several places you can pull over for photos and just to drink in the views.
arisaig has a nice cafe down at the harbour where the boat to the small isles leaves.gets busy.
camusdarach i've already mentioned and the silver sands - to me, on a decent weather day, probably the highlights of the road to the isles.
i like mallaig though many don't rate it much - there isn't a whole lot to do in it as a final destination; a few cafes and restaurants and shops but it still has the fishing boats, the ferries come in to the harbour from the islands, seagulls keen overhead and skye sits tantalisingly across the sea.


that route along the road to the isles could easily take up a day, if you include lunch somewhere and some short strolls.easy enough too, to simply enjoy the unfolding scene, take some photos and make for skye.book the ferry well in advance.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g186545-i910-k13476171-Friday_to_Monday_stay-Fort_William_Lochaber_Scottish_Highlands_Scotland.html,Friday to Monday stay,Scotlandmac,The Stunning...,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Scotlandmac?tab=forum,0,0,50,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,50,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,200,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,50,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,50,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,50,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,50,0,50.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,37500,"[""['asif',"", ""'start',"", ""'thread',"", ""'short',"", ""'time',"", ""'skyebut',"", ""'comment',"", ""'road',"", ""'isles',"", ""'journey',"", ""'train',"", ""'buff',"", ""'car',"", ""'drive',"", ""'route',"", ""'train',"", ""'route',"", ""'pretty',"", ""'much',"", ""'term',"", ""'view',"", ""'advantage',"", ""'allow',"", ""'stop',"", ""'much',"", ""'scenery',"", ""'route',"", ""'neptunes',"", ""'staircase',"", ""'worth',"", ""'time',"", ""'view',"", ""'ben',"", ""'clear',"", ""'fine',"", ""'view',"", ""'canal',"", ""'glenfinnan',"", ""'viaduct',"", ""'walk',"", ""'route',"", ""'nearer',"", ""'interest',"", ""'spot',"", ""'alone',"", ""'peak',"", ""'season',"", ""'favourite',"", ""'view',"", ""'glenfinnan',"", ""'hotel',"", ""'good',"", ""'lunch',"", ""'beautiful',"", ""'st',"", ""'finnans',"", ""'church',"", ""'nearby',"", ""'loch',"", ""'nan',"", ""'uamh',"", ""'bonnie',"", ""'prince',"", ""'charlie',"", ""'connections',"", ""'similar',"", ""'glenfinnan',"", ""'beautiful',"", ""'sea',"", ""'loch',"", ""'place',"", ""'pull',"", ""'photos',"", ""'drink',"", ""'view',"", ""'arisaig',"", ""'cafe',"", ""'harbour',"", ""'boat',"", ""'small',"", ""'isles',"", ""'leavesgets',"", ""'busy',"", ""'camusdarach',"", ""'silver',"", ""'sand',"", ""'decent',"", ""'weather',"", ""'day',"", ""'highlight',"", ""'road',"", ""'isles',"", ""'mallaig',"", ""'many',"", ""'rate',"", ""'much',"", ""'isnt',"", ""'whole',"", ""'lot',"", ""'final',"", ""'destination',"", ""'cafes',"", ""'restaurants',"", ""'shop',"", ""'fish',"", ""'boat',"", ""'ferry',"", ""'harbour',"", ""'islands',"", ""'seagulls',"", ""'keen',"", ""'overhead',"", ""'skye',"", ""'sit',"", ""'tantalisingly',"", ""'sea',"", ""'route',"", ""'road',"", ""'isles',"", ""'easily',"", ""'day',"", ""'include',"", ""'lunch',"", ""'short',"", ""'strollseasy',"", ""'simply',"", ""'unfold',"", ""'scene',"", ""'photos',"", ""'skyebook',"", ""'ferry',"", ""'advance']""]",False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,True,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

@ashesc no we went 2019 and stayed on the palm also. this will be our main break since christmas 2019 and as we live close to the hustle and bustle of london a good pool, time to chill great food and then plan accordingly for 3/4 days out max and it'll be over christmas so would anticipate all restaurants hopefully open.
@katie i loved zabeel that's where we stayed last time but this time it seemed to have gone up massively - loved the food in particular but could probably do an entertainer one night and go for a steak anyway - it still wouldn't be £3.7k and last time we had a club room which is not in that increase this time.
@sean yes definitely going to keep searching lucky me on having such a big family!
@lovedogs thank you that's why i have my reservations about ghh my children like water and i think although you can use the facilities of the meridien it seems a trek when one child inevitably forgets something on a daily basis and needs to go back to the room. my eldest although will be 17 when we travel is clueless on direction so she couldn't even be trusted to make her own way back.
what i would want to do this time would be breakfast desert safari (transfers included), ain wheel - same day as a mall, and actually atlantis we didn't do that last time. i think everyone cursed me when we did disney and universal as it was on such time restraints and schedule it felt as though we hadn't actually had a break same goes for city breaks when we do them. has anyone also done any fishing trips?",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g295424-i872-k13464077-Opinions_please_anantara-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html,Opinions please anantara,clawit,UK,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/clawit?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,50,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,50,0,0,0,0,0.0,50,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,200,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,50,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,50,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,50,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,50,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,37500,"[""['shaun',"", ""'c',"", ""'price',"", ""'different',"", ""'room',"", ""'flight',"", ""'contact',"", ""'direct',"", ""'zabeel',"", ""'hold',"", ""'lot',"", ""'room',"", ""'ghh',"", ""'reluctant',"", ""'hb',"", ""'3',"", ""'bed',"", ""'emirates',"", ""'release',"", ""'month',"", ""'see',"", ""'movement',"", ""'keen',"", ""'one',"", ""'hold',"", ""'point',"", ""'lot',"", ""'money',"", ""'difference',"", ""'longer',"", ""'stay',"", ""'ashesc',"", ""'2019',"", ""'stay',"", ""'palm',"", ""'main',"", ""'break',"", ""'christmas',"", ""'2019',"", ""'live',"", ""'close',"", ""'hustle',"", ""'bustle',"", ""'london',"", ""'good',"", ""'pool',"", ""'time',"", ""'chill',"", ""'food',"", ""'plan',"", ""'accordingly',"", ""'3',"", ""'4',"", ""'days',"", ""'max',"", ""'itll',"", ""'christmas',"", ""'anticipate',"", ""'restaurants',"", ""'open',"", ""'katie',"", ""'zabeel',"", ""'stay',"", ""'time',"", ""'time',"", ""'massively',"", ""'food',"", ""'particular',"", ""'entertainer',"", ""'one',"", ""'night',"", ""'steak',"", ""'£37k',"", ""'time',"", ""'club',"", ""'room',"", ""'increase',"", ""'time',"", ""'sean',"", ""'keep',"", ""'search',"", ""'lucky',"", ""'big',"", ""'family',"", ""'lovedogs',"", ""'reservations',"", ""'ghh',"", ""'children',"", ""'water',"", ""'facilities',"", ""'meridien',"", ""'trek',"", ""'one',"", ""'child',"", ""'inevitably',"", ""'forget',"", ""'something',"", ""'daily',"", ""'basis',"", ""'room',"", ""'eldest',"", ""'17',"", ""'travel',"", ""'clueless',"", ""'direction',"", ""'trust',"", ""'way',"", ""'time',"", ""'breakfast',"", ""'desert',"", ""'safari',"", ""'transfer',"", ""'include',"", ""'wheel',"", ""'day',"", ""'mall',"", ""'atlantis',"", ""'time',"", ""'curse',"", ""'disney',"", ""'universal',"", ""'time',"", ""'restraints',"", ""'schedule',"", ""'felt',"", ""'hadnt',"", ""'break',"", ""'city',"", ""'break',"", ""'fish',"", ""'trip']""]",False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

edited: 6:11 pm, march 16,","i don’t know hyatt place very well but it’s well situated if you want to be in a traditional area and explore old dubai.
there are many eateries close to hand but note most are quite casual and not licensed to serve alcohol. if you drink alcohol then there many hotels in deira where you can head for a drink or a meal.
the chelsea arms at sheraton creek is one of the oldest pubs in dubai.
many hotels in deira offer shuttle buses to mamzar beach park - it has a lovely stretch of sandy beach but facilities are old and toilets leave a lot to be desired but for a cheap day out the beach, it can’t be overlooked.
i will say if you’re planning on golfing days and are staying at hyatt place then the creek golf course is closer and it has several bars & restaurants with amazing creek views.
i personally would look at splitting your stay between two hotels especially if you’re there for 10 nights, i’d do 5 nights in old dubai and head to the other side of dubai for 5 nights especially if you’re looking to visit the emirates golf course - somewhere like tecom/barsha heights or the marina may suit. even if you’re not a fan of more modern areas it’ll be easier for sightseeing in this area.
your itinerary sounds fine but jumeirah mosque and the marina aren’t next to each other, marina is accessible by metro but jumeirah mosque isn’t. i’d personally visit dubai frame and jumeirah mosque on the same day, taking a taxi between the two.
dubai frame is in zabeel park, not really out on a limb but not much else about.
unless you have an organised tour the mosque doesn’t take that long as you cannot just wander in at any given time.
if you like traditional areas then the souks at bur dubai and bastakiya is a must. al seef is also a really nice area to visit although it’s newly redeveloped it is very traditional in design.

we are staying at the tryp in november when we work on the dubai airshow. it’s a bit of a walk to the metro but it has a nice bar and just behind the hotel is a great 24 hour restaurant called cascades. fantastic food and totally unexpected with fab staff.
good spot for the golf courses you mentioned. mate who has played everywhere and is a member of loch lomond thinks the els club is worth a go too.

edited: 11:45 am, june 05,","ive travelled all over and also was in phoneix one year in early august , phoneix and vegas were scorching hot but did not have the humidity that dubai has , so im just saying maybe take it a tad easily a bit in the day .
we walked with ease the vegas strip at midday and whilst phoenix was hotter it was manageable and we could eat outside with some degree of comfort , although most places did have misters .
no chance of that in dubai, its just to hot.
hotter than than and more uncomfortable would be singapore. ive never found the states that hot at that time ever.
a lot can be achieved in doors and early pm . dubai mall is really lovely in the pm so you could do burj khallifa before it gets dark then move on to the mall /fountains etc. its a huge mall with some highly expensive shops .
mall of the emirates is pretty standard now , but worth a trip if you want to ski at ski dubai.
atlantis and jumeriah beach are nice .
marina more for the late pm with the bars and restaurants - maybe do yellow boats tour but prob best when it is a bit cooler ie late pm.
i would say the theme parks are not as good as the states . ferrari world i thought was a bit to educational but it draws in people for that big ride. never done img i think a lot is indoors as well.

not many now though. some hotels allow you to book leisure day passes to go swimming, avoid the public swimming baths at troutbeck it gets very busy. nowhere is flat in the lakes to cycle except maybe the old keswick railway line, but ask before you hire, i'm sure they can give advice. brockhole on windermere has lots of activities for kids, they also used to do summer classes for adventure things but they book up very quickly. number one thing to do is the honister via ferrata, you will never forget the experience. for wet days (you will get them) kendal indoor climbing center is great, you can just have a drink and watch your child learn to climb safely, there is one at ambleside as well but not tried that, it is a lot smaller. we prefer ambleside as it is central for most places, it has craxy golf, putting, tennis as well and some easier walks, such as to grasmere. as someone said ambleside yha is good, best place in the lakes to sit outside and have a drink right on the lake, better than the pubs near by. platty kayaking on derwent is really good, make sure it is not a windy day

from an event that lasts a few weeks, and an economy that continues indefinitely - spot the obvious mis-match. plus, thousands of people avoid a country that hosts large events like these - south africa soccer world cup saw a huge decline in visitors across the months it hosted those games.
there is a lot of economic research that separates the fiction of the people promoting events, stadiums, the benefits of having a pro-team in their city and the reality. barcelona managed to re-invigorate a section of their city and london made some improvements, but really the numbers don't stack up.
when i was working in this area, the london olympics were supposed to generate 12billion pounds of economic benefit when pitched. a year ahead of the games that had fallen to one billion, and at the time of the event to maybe break-even.
some venues were not even used except for the games. the cycling velodrome cost 170 million pounds and the national cycling squad didn't even use it for training.

overall your itin looks fine.
shikoku - with 4 days better rent a car locally in takamatsu to explore.
my visit to iya valley, sodoshima by car in nov 2018.

kyoto - ine fishing village would be a day trip. one way by jr express train to amanohashidate takes about 2 hours.
noto peninsula - visit after kanazawa. pick up a rental car there to visit ainokura for half day and then head north to former for a few days. for 1st-timers, better visit shirakawa-go where there are more facilities such as shops, restaurants etc.
my visits to those including noto kongo by car in nov 2015.

matsumoto castle can be visited in less than 3 hours. if you depart early (before 11am) from takayama by express bus, you could head towards kawaguchi-ko in fuji 5-lake for overnight via kofu afterwards.
planning is fine but don't commit to non-refundable air tickets, hotels until travel restrictions are eased/lifted.
monitor this for constant updates.

dli_nk - thank you for sharing stunning fall photos.
william512 - also enjoyed your pictures. sakura bloom shots were wonderful, and your flower field pictures inspired me to add the two locations to our trip!
global1715255 - i thought your link to the intro to kabuki was helpful, and will get my husband to watch it before the trip. on your suggestion, i also added an overnight stay at ine fishing village.
hfot2 - my husband and i love easy, scenic bike rides like the kibi plain trail. in okayama, can korakuen gardens and kurashiki visit be combined in one day (mar 29) without overdoing it? if yes, we can then do the bike ride on mar 30, so we can take as much time as we want on the ride. the only other thing we are doing that day is driving to iya valley in late afternoon.
after more research i decided to forego the noto peninsula days, primarily because its not the right time to see the rice fields (flooded in late apr), and i really like the idea of overnighting in ine. i also spent time reading about shikoku. it was hard to decide what to see and what to leave out. i found that the matsuyama spring festival may happen while we are there, so focused on that area and iya valley. here's the latest itinerary version, with more detail added. still need to fill in tokyo, and then work on hotel/travel details.

first to note to avoid any confusion that the kembali villas you listed in post #3 (perhaps it was an auto link) is not kembali beach bungalows in amed.
kembali villas linked in post #3 are in seminyak.
do you dive or just snorkeling.
pemuteran
check exact location of any property carefully. pemuteran spreads out a long way also inland.
pemuteran is mrs pigs favourite after amed.
we stay at 
you have to walk down the beach a little to enter the sea for snorkeling. main reasons is that their are a lot of sea urchins in the sea along with low lying reefs close to shore. there is a signpost.
entry is more or less in front of the pondok sari.
you will also find the biorock reef restoration project.
the only thing is that pemuteran bay is very sandy (just offshore). at full moon/spring tides/windy/choppy seas the sand can get churned up in the bay. even snorkeling close to shore it can be like snorkeling in a milkshake. literally can’t see your hand in front of your face. biorock not visible.
i’ve been diving well offshore and when in shallower water 10-15m on a sunny day it was like diving in a snowglobe with all the glistening sand.
i use the dive centre on the beach behind the swimming pool/wellness massage centre.

they have 2 dive boats. one rib and one larger fibreglass hull boat.
if only snorkeling you can enquire at the dive centre or others along the beach, about snorkeling trips menjangan.
dive trips often willing to take snorkelers if space. advantage is the boat goes from the beach.
you can arrange snorkeling trips locally but this may involve a road trip in a minibus before picking up a local boat.

we spent a month in thailand feb 2020 with our children aged 8 and 11. absolutely amazing experience and so worthwhile doing with them.
our itinerary was:
3 nights bangkok stayed at ibis riverside (great family rooms)
2 nights khao yai stayed at greenleaf and did the afternoon tour on 1st day then full day tour on 2nd day. absolutely amazing place and greenleaf is highly recommended. tours were incredible and we saw wild elephants as well as so much else.
next we got train to ayutthaya and spent afternoon on temple tour before getting night train to chiang mai.
7 nights at chiang mai which again absolutely fabulous with kids. highlights were day with karen tribe native elephants (cant recommended highly enough), sticky waterfalls, big game fishing, grand canyon water park.
then we got direct flight to krabi and taxi to koh lanta for 5 nights. koh lanta amazing and very family friendly. best day ever was a private long-tail trip to koh rok, most magical day of my life with lanta paradise i think was called. also loved car hire and going to national park, and mangrove kayaking trip.
after this we got speedboat to koh mook for 3 nights. very quiet but very pretty and a totally different vibe as not at all developed, no real roads, no 7/11, no atm etc. loved it here, only thing put me off going back was a hotel behind main beach been knocked down and was quite a building site.
next got speedboat to koh lipe for 4 nights. stayed at castaway in family house. absolutely stunning here, like nowhere else i've been. but busier. snorkeling incredible and the water the most beautiful crystal clear turquoise colour. loved it.
then flew from hat yai to bangkok for 1 more night before heading home.
i would love to do it again and would not hesitate to encourage others to travel to thailand with young families. enjoy the planning i'm very envious!!!",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g293915-i3686-k13465309-Jungle_Beach_with_children_ideas_welcome-Thailand.html,Jungle + Beach with children... ideas welcome!,Trudie C,0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/937trudiec?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,50,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,50,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,50,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,50,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,50,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,50,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,200,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,50,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,50,0,200,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,60000,"[""['spend',"", ""'month',"", ""'thailand',"", ""'feb',"", ""'2020',"", ""'children',"", ""'age',"", ""'8',"", ""'11',"", ""'amaze',"", ""'experience',"", ""'worthwhile',"", ""'itinerary',"", ""'3',"", ""'nights',"", ""'bangkok',"", ""'stay',"", ""'ibis',"", ""'riverside',"", ""'family',"", ""'room',"", ""'2',"", ""'nights',"", ""'khao',"", ""'yai',"", ""'stay',"", ""'greenleaf',"", ""'afternoon',"", ""'tour',"", ""'1st',"", ""'day',"", ""'full',"", ""'day',"", ""'tour',"", ""'2nd',"", ""'day',"", ""'amaze',"", ""'place',"", ""'greenleaf',"", ""'highly',"", ""'recommend',"", ""'tour',"", ""'incredible',"", ""'saw',"", ""'wild',"", ""'elephants',"", ""'much',"", ""'train',"", ""'ayutthaya',"", ""'spend',"", ""'afternoon',"", ""'temple',"", ""'tour',"", ""'night',"", ""'train',"", ""'chiang',"", ""'mai',"", ""'7',"", ""'nights',"", ""'chiang',"", ""'mai',"", ""'fabulous',"", ""'kid',"", ""'highlight',"", ""'day',"", ""'karen',"", ""'tribe',"", ""'native',"", ""'elephants',"", ""'recommend',"", ""'highly',"", ""'sticky',"", ""'waterfalls',"", ""'big',"", ""'game',"", ""'fish',"", ""'grand',"", ""'canyon',"", ""'water',"", ""'park',"", ""'direct',"", ""'flight',"", ""'krabi',"", ""'taxi',"", ""'koh',"", ""'lanta',"", ""'5',"", ""'nights',"", ""'koh',"", ""'lanta',"", ""'amaze',"", ""'family',"", ""'friendly',"", ""'day',"", ""'ever',"", ""'private',"", ""'long',"", ""'tail',"", ""'trip',"", ""'koh',"", ""'rok',"", ""'magical',"", ""'day',"", ""'life',"", ""'lanta',"", ""'paradise',"", ""'call',"", ""'car',"", ""'hire',"", ""'national',"", ""'park',"", ""'mangrove',"", ""'kayak',"", ""'trip',"", ""'speedboat',"", ""'koh',"", ""'mook',"", ""'3',"", ""'nights',"", ""'quiet',"", ""'pretty',"", ""'totally',"", ""'different',"", ""'vibe',"", ""'develop',"", ""'real',"", ""'roads',"", ""'7',"", ""'11',"", ""'atm',"", ""'hotel',"", ""'behind',"", ""'main',"", ""'beach',"", ""'knock',"", ""'quite',"", ""'build',"", ""'site',"", ""'speedboat',"", ""'koh',"", ""'lipe',"", ""'4',"", ""'nights',"", ""'stay',"", ""'castaway',"", ""'family',"", ""'house',"", ""'stun',"", ""'nowhere',"", ""'busier',"", ""'snorkel',"", ""'incredible',"", ""'water',"", ""'beautiful',"", ""'crystal',"", ""'clear',"", ""'turquoise',"", ""'colour',"", ""'fly',"", ""'hat',"", ""'yai',"", ""'bangkok',"", ""'1',"", ""'night',"", ""'head',"", ""'home',"", ""'hesitate',"", ""'encourage',"", ""'others',"", ""'travel',"", ""'thailand',"", ""'young',"", ""'families',"", ""'plan',"", ""'envious']""]",False,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

you couldn’t walk 20-30minutes (ish) daytime either.
this didn’t stop holiday, touristy desert safari, jet skis, ferrari world, atlantis water park, malls, burj khalifa, madinat, le perle, etc.
doing break holiday nicely, long days sun toll dubai, holiday destinations august.
would august; could different time.
would that’s time could go; yes.","we were there august just gone, for 2 weeks.
we sat around the pool during the day, but you’re literally in the pool every 1/2 hour or so, which isn’t a problem tbh, so it’s imperative that your hotel has a great pool area imo. too hot for the beach as the sea is too warm to enjoy properly. absolutely no chance of eating outdoors or an evening. the most we lasted outdoors of an evening (other than at the desert safari) was watching the fountain show at the burj khalifa. then straight back indoors.
you couldn’t walk around more than 20-30minutes (ish) during the daytime either.
this didn’t stop us having a great holiday, we did most of the touristy things such as desert safari, jet skis, ferrari world, atlantis water park, malls, burj khalifa, madinat, le perle, etc.
doing these things break the holiday up nicely, especially as long days in the sun do take their toll in dubai, more than other holiday destinations do in august.
would i go again in august; probably not if i could go a different time.
would i go if that’s the only time i could go; yes.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g295424-i872-k13482819-Weather_in_August-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html,Weather in August,JonOneB,UK,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JonOneB?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,50,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,50,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,50.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,50,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,200,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,50.0,50,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,50,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,37500,"[""['august',"", ""'2',"", ""'weeks',"", ""'sit',"", ""'pool',"", ""'day',"", ""'you’re',"", ""'literally',"", ""'pool',"", ""'1',"", ""'2',"", ""'hour',"", ""'isn’t',"", ""'problem',"", ""'tbh',"", ""'it’s',"", ""'imperative',"", ""'hotel',"", ""'pool',"", ""'area',"", ""'imo',"", ""'hot',"", ""'beach',"", ""'sea',"", ""'warm',"", ""'properly',"", ""'eat',"", ""'outdoors',"", ""'outdoors',"", ""'desert',"", ""'safari',"", ""'watch',"", ""'fountain',"", ""'show',"", ""'burj',"", ""'khalifa',"", ""'straight',"", ""'indoors',"", ""'couldn’t',"", ""'walk',"", ""'20',"", ""'30minutes',"", ""'ish',"", ""'daytime',"", ""'didn’t',"", ""'stop',"", ""'holiday',"", ""'touristy',"", ""'desert',"", ""'safari',"", ""'jet',"", ""'ski',"", ""'ferrari',"", ""'world',"", ""'atlantis',"", ""'water',"", ""'park',"", ""'malls',"", ""'burj',"", ""'khalifa',"", ""'madinat',"", ""'le',"", ""'perle',"", ""'break',"", ""'holiday',"", ""'nicely',"", ""'long',"", ""'days',"", ""'sun',"", ""'toll',"", ""'dubai',"", ""'holiday',"", ""'destinations',"", ""'august',"", ""'august',"", ""'different',"", ""'time',"", ""'that’s',"", ""'time']""]",False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

you’ll find you spend a lot of time watching the race on the big screens (or your ipad) as well as what’s in front of you so a decent view of a screen is important - silverstone is pancake flat so seeing across the circuit is near impossible). high up won’t achieve much more viewing and puts you i bit further from the action, the win is that if it’s raining you’ll be drier and if it’s blazing sun there’s some shade - i doubt it matters but i’d want to be a dozen rows back from the front to cover weather extremes.
a f1 race is a relatively long event and there’s no natural ‘half time’ so from drivers parade to the end will take its toll on the bladders of the folk who go to the race with a few (or a lot of) beers (and there will be quite a few of them). if you sit at the end of a row you’ll be jumping up to let them visit the facilities with monotonous regularity, if you sit in the middle it will be a struggle if you get the call of nature. your choice!
ot, but if you want to watch a motor race rather than just ‘be there’ brands hatch offers a better viewing experience.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g504028-i19734-k13520099-British_F1_2021_first_time_tickets_in_Becketts_vs_Luffied-Silverstone_Northamptonshire_En.html,British F1 2021 first time - tickets in Becketts vs Luffied,Mark E,US,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mark_Elliott?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,100,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,100,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,100,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,100,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,100.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,100,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,60000,"[""['i’ve',"", ""'luffield',"", ""'can’t',"", ""'help',"", ""'you’ll',"", ""'spend',"", ""'lot',"", ""'time',"", ""'watch',"", ""'race',"", ""'big',"", ""'screen',"", ""'ipad',"", ""'what’s',"", ""'front',"", ""'decent',"", ""'view',"", ""'screen',"", ""'important',"", ""'silverstone',"", ""'pancake',"", ""'flat',"", ""'see',"", ""'circuit',"", ""'near',"", ""'impossible',"", ""'high',"", ""'won’t',"", ""'achieve',"", ""'much',"", ""'view',"", ""'action',"", ""'win',"", ""'it’s',"", ""'rain',"", ""'you’ll',"", ""'drier',"", ""'it’s',"", ""'blaze',"", ""'sun',"", ""'there’s',"", ""'shade',"", ""'doubt',"", ""'matter',"", ""'i’d',"", ""'dozen',"", ""'row',"", ""'front',"", ""'cover',"", ""'weather',"", ""'extremes',"", ""'f1',"", ""'race',"", ""'relatively',"", ""'long',"", ""'event',"", ""'there’s',"", ""'natural',"", ""'‘half',"", ""'time’',"", ""'drivers',"", ""'parade',"", ""'end',"", ""'toll',"", ""'bladders',"", ""'folk',"", ""'race',"", ""'lot',"", ""'beers',"", ""'quite',"", ""'sit',"", ""'end',"", ""'row',"", ""'you’ll',"", ""'jump',"", ""'visit',"", ""'facilities',"", ""'monotonous',"", ""'regularity',"", ""'sit',"", ""'middle',"", ""'struggle',"", ""'call',"", ""'nature',"", ""'choice',"", ""'ot',"", ""'watch',"", ""'motor',"", ""'race',"", ""'‘be',"", ""'there’',"", ""'brand',"", ""'hatch',"", ""'view',"", ""'experience']""]",False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,True,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

so looking at the map the town of tapan is about half way between bengkulu and padang. is there a vehicle service between bengkulu -> tapan, tapan -> padang. tapan has several guesthouses so i guess people are travelling that coastal route?",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g294225-i7219-k13473942-Travel_SW_Sumatra-Indonesia.html,Travel SW Sumatra,Chorazin,0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chorazin?tab=forum,0,0,100,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,100,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,100,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,100.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,40000,"[""['hop',"", ""'2',"", ""'months',"", ""'indonesia',"", ""'end',"", ""'finish',"", ""'sumatra',"", ""'wonder',"", ""'travel',"", ""'western',"", ""'coast',"", ""'w',"", ""'trans',"", ""'sumatera',"", ""'hwy',"", ""'bandar',"", ""'lampung',"", ""'krui',"", ""'route',"", ""'travel',"", ""'surf',"", ""'crew',"", ""'afield',"", ""'information',"", ""'become',"", ""'hard',"", ""'break',"", ""'14hr',"", ""'road',"", ""'trip',"", ""'bengkulu',"", ""'padang',"", ""'14hr',"", ""'bus',"", ""'trip',"", ""'laos',"", ""'overly',"", ""'keen',"", ""'relive',"", ""'experience',"", ""'map',"", ""'town',"", ""'tapan',"", ""'half',"", ""'way',"", ""'bengkulu',"", ""'padang',"", ""'vehicle',"", ""'service',"", ""'bengkulu',"", ""'tapan',"", ""'tapan',"", ""'padang',"", ""'tapan',"", ""'guesthouses',"", ""'guess',"", ""'people',"", ""'travel',"", ""'coastal',"", ""'route']""]",False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

it’s rather odd that there is no quarantine hotel provision at manchester airport, because, for example, a scheduled qatar airways flight from doha landed this evening at 20.31 bst... and a ryanair flight from tenerife is due to land at 22.18 hrs...
its also odd that when people are booking their quarantine hotel, they can express a “ preference “ concerning food, but it is only a “ preference” and cannot be guaranteed, so people who follow a particular dietary regime for religious or other cultural/ medical reasons could have significant problems,
same with people with disabilities... they can ask for, say, a disability adapted or wheelchair friendly room, but can’t be sure of getting one.
i can see the newspaper headlines in a few days time when people who are already p1ssed off at having to pay for their own virtual incarceration, find that their particular and important needs have been ignored...

my husband planning 2022 honeymoon indonesia appreciate help itinerary (side note: got married pandemic, pandemic circumstances pushed trip ""newlyweds"" 2022!) obviously much see many islands, mindful cramming much. pandemic wanderlust making decisions difficult though!
budget issue we'd spend solid two weeks in-country, including travel time. could extend couple days beyond 14 days need be, vacation time saved then!
we want split trip - half exploring breathtaking nature, culture/temples, unique experiences adventures (nothing strenuous, moderate hiking/biking/snorkeling definitely speed), second half relaxing continuing breathtaking natural beauty (away lots tourists! beaten path, understand hard two-ish weeks).
we're currently thinking:
1) days exploring bali (specifically, ubud northern eastern bali. care visit bali's kuta super touristy areas, care nightlife)
2) 3-4 days exploring lombok (specifically, staying southern lombok beaches near lombok's kuta. perhaps road tripping driver/guide east and/or west stopping explore local villages culture? we're quite mount rinjani crater rim hike, beaches southern lombok luxury villa sound nice us. want explore though, sit beach - suggestions worthwhile check lombok?)
3) 3-4 days mayahana resort gili meno - time need seriously nothing chill beach :)
4) return last night bali heading home.
what plan above? days distributed well? anything adjusted/swapped out?
i'd love recommendations best explore lombok.
lastly, missing getting sumatra, java, and/or flores? places ""worthwhile"" swapped lombok/gili meno? originally looking exploring flores/komodo, scuba dive (only snorkel) seemed less practical lombok terms travel logistics. feedback suggestions really, appreciated! thanks!!","hi fellow travelers -
my husband and i are planning a may 2022 honeymoon to indonesia and would really appreciate some help with the itinerary (side note: we got married just before the pandemic, but the pandemic and other circumstances have pushed our first trip as ""newlyweds"" to 2022!) there is obviously so much to see and so many islands, but we are mindful of not cramming in too much. my pandemic wanderlust is making decisions very difficult though!
budget isn't really an issue and we'd like to spend a solid two weeks in-country, not including travel time. we could even extend this by a couple days beyond 14 days if need be, with all that vacation time we will have saved up by then!
we really want to split the trip - first half exploring breathtaking nature, culture/temples, having unique experiences and adventures (nothing too strenuous, but moderate hiking/biking/snorkeling are definitely our speed), and the second half really relaxing and continuing to take in breathtaking natural beauty (away from lots of tourists! we would like to get off the beaten path, but understand that can be hard with only two-ish weeks).
we're currently thinking:
1) 7 days exploring bali (specifically, ubud and northern and eastern bali. we don't care to visit bali's kuta or any of the super touristy areas, nor do we care about nightlife)
2) 3-4 days exploring lombok (specifically, staying in southern lombok at one of the beaches near lombok's kuta. perhaps road tripping with a driver/guide to the east and/or west and stopping to explore local villages and culture? we're not quite up for the mount rinjani crater rim hike, but beaches in southern lombok with a luxury villa sound nice to us. we still want to explore though, not just sit on a beach - does anyone have suggestions for worthwhile things to check out on lombok?)
3) 3-4 days at mayahana resort on gili meno - this is all the time we need to seriously do nothing but chill on a beach :)
4) return for one last night in bali before heading home.
what do you think of the plan above? are the days distributed well? anything that should be adjusted/swapped out?
i'd also love recommendations for how to best explore lombok.
lastly, will we be missing out by not getting to sumatra, java, and/or flores? are any of these places more ""worthwhile"" to be swapped out with lombok/gili meno? we originally were looking at exploring flores/komodo, but we don't scuba dive (only snorkel) and it seemed less practical than lombok in terms of travel logistics. feedback and suggestions would be really, really appreciated!

however if singapore is still a small bubble, or even opening up but isn't open to people who have been in your base country then it will still be effectively out of reach.
more importantly, they may not have a waiver allowing a refund if its simply your country of residence being barred while many others are being allowed in. so you need to think about the terms and conditions on the tickets before buying in relation to how singapore is opening up to the outside world.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g294262-i1747-k10980213-The_Singapore_F1_Grand_Prix_Thread-Singapore.html,The Singapore F1 Grand Prix Thread,Mankster,0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mankster?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,50.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,50,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,200,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,25000,"[""['singapore',"", ""'moment',"", ""'see',"", ""'sign',"", ""'preparation',"", ""'event',"", ""'see',"", ""'much',"", ""'closer',"", ""'time',"", ""'physically',"", ""'remarkable',"", ""'fast',"", ""'plus',"", ""'ha',"", ""'schedule',"", ""'weekend',"", ""'october',"", ""'signal',"", ""'race',"", ""'online',"", ""'official',"", ""'site',"", ""'isnt',"", ""'ticket',"", ""'sale',"", ""'inklings',"", ""'race',"", ""'hook',"", ""'news',"", ""'site',"", ""'plus',"", ""'overall',"", ""'f1',"", ""'core',"", ""'site',"", ""'latest',"", ""'information',"", ""'ticket',"", ""'try',"", ""'steer',"", ""'plan',"", ""'singapore',"", ""'small',"", ""'bubble',"", ""'open',"", ""'isnt',"", ""'open',"", ""'people',"", ""'base',"", ""'country',"", ""'effectively',"", ""'reach',"", ""'importantly',"", ""'may',"", ""'waiver',"", ""'allow',"", ""'refund',"", ""'simply',"", ""'country',"", ""'residence',"", ""'bar',"", ""'many',"", ""'others',"", ""'allow',"", ""'term',"", ""'ticket',"", ""'buy',"", ""'relation',"", ""'singapore',"", ""'open',"", ""'outside',"", ""'world']""]",False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

shaun will often say that a couple of hours on google maps laying out your todo list is invaluable. as the city is long and thin, get things in the wrong order and you will spend a lot of time and money in taxis racing up and down the szr!
another option would be to have a driver for the day when you have lots on. sometimes it makes more sense to know you have a car waiting as you leave an attraction and have somewhere to leave bags etc when you are inside. when i organised events, dubai your way (where we supplied couples with a good driver) was a popular part of the tour itinerary.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g295424-i872-k13636739-Orient_tours_VS_own_website_for_the_main_attractions-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html,Orient tours VS own website for the main attractions,Sean R,UK,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/275seanr?tab=forum,0,0,50,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,50,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,50,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,50,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,200,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,30000,"[""['completely',"", ""'shaun',"", ""'frame',"", ""'easy',"", ""'one',"", ""'simple',"", ""'taxi',"", ""'metro',"", ""'fancy',"", ""'join',"", ""'trip',"", ""'older',"", ""'part',"", ""'town',"", ""'instance',"", ""'afternoon',"", ""'lot',"", ""'advice',"", ""'miracle',"", ""'garden',"", ""'bus',"", ""'post',"", ""'taxi',"", ""'suggestion',"", ""'pair',"", ""'something',"", ""'end',"", ""'city',"", ""'lunch',"", ""'emirates',"", ""'golf',"", ""'club',"", ""'wander',"", ""'mall',"", ""'emirates',"", ""'jumeriah',"", ""'madinat',"", ""'shaun',"", ""'couple',"", ""'hours',"", ""'google',"", ""'map',"", ""'lay',"", ""'todo',"", ""'invaluable',"", ""'city',"", ""'long',"", ""'thin',"", ""'wrong',"", ""'order',"", ""'spend',"", ""'lot',"", ""'time',"", ""'money',"", ""'taxis',"", ""'race',"", ""'szr',"", ""'driver',"", ""'day',"", ""'lot',"", ""'sense',"", ""'car',"", ""'wait',"", ""'attraction',"", ""'bag',"", ""'inside',"", ""'organise',"", ""'events',"", ""'dubai',"", ""'way',"", ""'supply',"", ""'couple',"", ""'good',"", ""'driver',"", ""'popular',"", ""'part',"", ""'tour',"", ""'itinerary']""]",False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

mecure is very close & i think grand millenium will be a bit closer but you’ll pay more for the privilege. if you’re heading to the golf course then you’ll be getting a taxi but this is a very convenient base for getting to most courses.
when over this side of dubai as well as golfing visits to the marina, palm, ibn battuta ( if heading to ad), miracle garden, mall of the emirates makes sense to visit when this part of dubai.
it’s probably a little quicker to get to dubai mall via metro from tryp than baniyas square and you’re on the same line but it’s easy enough from either.
hyatt place is more convenient for deira souks & creek golf course, you can get the metro ( green line) straight to al fahidi from baniyas square alternatively take a cheap abra across the creek and explore old dubai.

from baniyas square, it should in theory be quicker about 15 minutes but traffic can be busy along the creek road in peak times. alternatively get a bus from baniyas square which will take a bit longer but will be cheap as chips.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g295424-i872-k13504317-Help_with_plans-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html,help with plans,hannahengland,UK,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hannahengland?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,100,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,400,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,45000,"[""['tryp',"", ""'isn’t',"", ""'bad',"", ""'shout',"", ""'5',"", ""'10',"", ""'minutes',"", ""'metro',"", ""'fast',"", ""'walk',"", ""'mecure',"", ""'close',"", ""'grand',"", ""'millenium',"", ""'closer',"", ""'you’ll',"", ""'pay',"", ""'privilege',"", ""'you’re',"", ""'head',"", ""'golf',"", ""'course',"", ""'you’ll',"", ""'taxi',"", ""'convenient',"", ""'base',"", ""'course',"", ""'side',"", ""'dubai',"", ""'golf',"", ""'visit',"", ""'marina',"", ""'palm',"", ""'ibn',"", ""'battuta',"", ""'head',"", ""'ad',"", ""'miracle',"", ""'garden',"", ""'mall',"", ""'emirates',"", ""'sense',"", ""'visit',"", ""'part',"", ""'dubai',"", ""'it’s',"", ""'little',"", ""'quicker',"", ""'dubai',"", ""'mall',"", ""'via',"", ""'metro',"", ""'tryp',"", ""'baniyas',"", ""'square',"", ""'you’re',"", ""'line',"", ""'it’s',"", ""'easy',"", ""'hyatt',"", ""'place',"", ""'convenient',"", ""'deira',"", ""'souks',"", ""'creek',"", ""'golf',"", ""'course',"", ""'metro',"", ""'green',"", ""'line',"", ""'straight',"", ""'al',"", ""'fahidi',"", ""'baniyas',"", ""'square',"", ""'alternatively',"", ""'cheap',"", ""'abra',"", ""'creek',"", ""'explore',"", ""'old',"", ""'dubai',"", ""'jumeirah',"", ""'mosque',"", ""'tryp',"", ""'head',"", ""'al',"", ""'sufouh',"", ""'jumeirah',"", ""'beach',"", ""'road',"", ""'pass',"", ""'hotels',"", ""'palace',"", ""'guest',"", ""'house',"", ""'jumeirah',"", ""'district',"", ""'it’s',"", ""'quite',"", ""'pleasant',"", ""'drive',"", ""'it’s',"", ""'25',"", ""'minute',"", ""'drive',"", ""'baniyas',"", ""'square',"", ""'theory',"", ""'quicker',"", ""'15',"", ""'minutes',"", ""'traffic',"", ""'busy',"", ""'creek',"", ""'road',"", ""'peak',"", ""'time',"", ""'alternatively',"", ""'bus',"", ""'baniyas',"", ""'square',"", ""'longer',"", ""'cheap',"", ""'chip']""]",False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

i’d 12 year old old lakes aquarium now.

plenty of walks 12 year old could manage from here so you wouldn’t need to drive one or two days. can access the windermere ferry from waterhead also brockhole easy to get to.
if wet day or evening activity then there is a choice of cinemas. putting green and crazy golf if that’s your thing.
activities we’ve done from this base have included both go apes (whinlatter and grizedale).
i’d say your 12 year old is probably too old for the lakes aquarium now.
summer 2019 we stayed in lorton which gave easy access to keswick area but we also were able to get out to the coast and avoid the crowds.
i’d suggest avoiding windermere in the school holidays if you can.

no group of tourists is more important. each tourist is an individual with their own spending, their own time in country, their own number of return visits, etc. a japanese business man popping down for a weekend of golf is just as important as a uk gap year backpacker nickel & dime'ing their way across the country.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g293916-i3687-k13498403-Possible_lifting_of_quarantine-Bangkok.html,Possible lifting of quarantine?,Life's a Beach ⛱,Sweden,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/UP2UorNot?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,50,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,50,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,200,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,50,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,27500,"[""['214',"", ""'live',"", ""'near',"", ""'travel',"", ""'frequently',"", ""'short',"", ""'trip',"", ""'visitor',"", ""'stats',"", ""'double',"", ""'count',"", ""'visit',"", ""'visit',"", ""'assign',"", ""'count',"", ""'value',"", ""'base',"", ""'distance',"", ""'travel',"", ""'americans',"", ""'canadians',"", ""'double',"", ""'20',"", ""'28',"", ""'hours',"", ""'fly',"", ""'time',"", ""'versus',"", ""'eu',"", ""'uk',"", ""'12ish',"", ""'assign',"", ""'count',"", ""'value',"", ""'base',"", ""'duration',"", ""'visit',"", ""'expats',"", ""'beat',"", ""'hand',"", ""'twice',"", ""'block',"", ""'visit',"", ""'visit',"", ""'period',"", ""'group',"", ""'tourists',"", ""'important',"", ""'tourist',"", ""'individual',"", ""'spend',"", ""'time',"", ""'country',"", ""'number',"", ""'visit',"", ""'japanese',"", ""'business',"", ""'man',"", ""'pop',"", ""'weekend',"", ""'golf',"", ""'important',"", ""'uk',"", ""'gap',"", ""'backpacker',"", ""'nickel',"", ""'dimeing',"", ""'way',"", ""'country']""]",False,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

i do like to stay in one location for a few days, so try to avoid one night stands on road trips if possible :-) . last time we were in scotland we stayed in edinburgh for 3 days/3 nights i believe. i am wondering if it would work to stay in glasgow for something like 3 or 4 nights and maybe do a day trip via train to stirling one day and maybe go back to edinburgh another day? not sure on edinburgh, but we did enjoy. it. i think the university of edinburgh doesn't have the creative writing courses that strathclyde does, though. we may also look at the university of glasgow, too, but strathclyde is tops for her right now.
i threw nui galway in ireland into the mix because we have really good friends who are both professors (their oldest daughter is a year younger than my uni-bound one) and they love galway, having taught there on exchanges. my daughter is a bit intimidated by trying to figure out the irish university application system as well as the uk system, but i thought while we are in on that side of the atlantic maybe we could check it out, plus our friends might be able to make some suggestions and introductions. and we also have another old friend who lives in dublin. i know adding ireland does make it a bit more complex. we might be able to fly into dublin or out of it to help with the logistics.",0,0,0,0,UK,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,100,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,100,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,100,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,100,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,100,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,100,100.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,70000,"[""['indeed',"", ""'trip',"", ""'place',"", ""'uea',"", ""'creative',"", ""'write',"", ""'course',"", ""'strathclyde',"", ""'overall',"", ""'uni',"", ""'stem',"", ""'orient',"", ""'aberystwyth',"", ""'quite',"", ""'research',"", ""'three',"", ""'worth',"", ""'investigate',"", ""'person',"", ""'norwich',"", ""'good',"", ""'mark',"", ""'engage',"", ""'small',"", ""'city',"", ""'read',"", ""'google',"", ""'streetview',"", ""'armchair',"", ""'tour',"", ""'stay',"", ""'one',"", ""'location',"", ""'days',"", ""'try',"", ""'avoid',"", ""'one',"", ""'night',"", ""'stand',"", ""'road',"", ""'trip',"", ""'time',"", ""'scotland',"", ""'stay',"", ""'edinburgh',"", ""'3',"", ""'days',"", ""'3',"", ""'nights',"", ""'wonder',"", ""'work',"", ""'stay',"", ""'glasgow',"", ""'something',"", ""'3',"", ""'4',"", ""'nights',"", ""'day',"", ""'trip',"", ""'via',"", ""'train',"", ""'stirling',"", ""'one',"", ""'day',"", ""'edinburgh',"", ""'day',"", ""'edinburgh',"", ""'university',"", ""'edinburgh',"", ""'creative',"", ""'write',"", ""'course',"", ""'strathclyde',"", ""'may',"", ""'university',"", ""'glasgow',"", ""'strathclyde',"", ""'top',"", ""'right',"", ""'throw',"", ""'nui',"", ""'galway',"", ""'ireland',"", ""'mix',"", ""'good',"", ""'friends',"", ""'professors',"", ""'oldest',"", ""'daughter',"", ""'younger',"", ""'uni',"", ""'bind',"", ""'one',"", ""'galway',"", ""'teach',"", ""'exchange',"", ""'daughter',"", ""'intimidate',"", ""'try',"", ""'figure',"", ""'irish',"", ""'university',"", ""'application',"", ""'system',"", ""'uk',"", ""'system',"", ""'side',"", ""'atlantic',"", ""'plus',"", ""'friends',"", ""'able',"", ""'suggestions',"", ""'introductions',"", ""'old',"", ""'friend',"", ""'live',"", ""'dublin',"", ""'add',"", ""'ireland',"", ""'complex',"", ""'able',"", ""'fly',"", ""'dublin',"", ""'help',"", ""'logistics']""]",True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

","i would say 2 days in edinburgh unless you plan say, a day's tour of the highlands. something like this will take you through some great west highland scenery:

however not necessarily rabbies - there are other operators too though tours tend to be whistlestop so might not suit your need for a slower pace.
the glasgow to fw train journey gives you several very good options for breaking the journey for a day or so to enjoy some beautiful places:
for example, you could stop and overnight around tarbert on loch lomond, a tiny place but where there is an excellent boat trip on the loch to inversnaid.eating out though is limited and arrochar next door would be your best bet, using a taxi. otherwise, staying somewhere like pretty luss village also on the loch, would be another great option (no train station .potentially taxi from a nearby station if that can be arranged.local hotels might help with that.)
then resume your train journey north with another potential stop at corrour - most remote station in uk, gorgeous environment, great bistro right at the station, excellent accommodation too and the chance to do flattish walks by loch ossian.

then resume journey to fort william.the scenery to fw is stunning.
you can certainly carry on to mallaig too - not a lot in mallaig , a down to earth wee fishing/ferry port, but i personally like it for a short time, with great views to skye too (which you could potentially go over too also - magnificent island.bus to portree or stay in south skye around isle ornsay perhaps (eilean iarmain hotel is in a gorgeous spot.)

you could return via bus from fw will would also allow a stop at glencoe - perhaps staying overnight in the kingshouse hotel, right on rannoch moor amidst stunning scenery. nothing else there except red deer and the river, moor and mountains.

when we did the trip from mai chau to ninh binh we had planned to spend 3 days in mai chau as we loved it when we first stayed the 15-20 years ago. it had changed a lot. the two homestays that were there back then had multiplied to something like 50. to get the authentic experience you seek, i would suggest getting way out into the valley away from the main settlements. ninh binh needs 3 nights to see the main sights, take a few boat trips etc. . both mc and nb get very busy with domestic tourists especially at weekends so time your visits mid week if possible.
in between the two locations we spent one night at each of three small villages. these one night stays were about right as we were mainly hiking (and part driving) between each. on a motorbike with a guide i can imagine it would be a great experience .
if you can add in some extra days, have you consider the caves in phong nha ke be? well worth tif you can add in maybe three nights en route from hue to ninh binh by train.quite a lot else to do in teh area other than the cave (although they are amazing!)
as for traveling by train, it is my preferred option in vietnam. not the most comfortable but ok i would recommend going for a soft sleeper berth (bottom bunk if you can). my understanding is that the schedules have been dramatically curtailed, when they will return to normal. two benefits of train travel; they are usually overnight and you save on a nights accommodation. most live late evening and arrive early morning effectively allowing a full day at either end.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g293921-i8432-k13495331-April_Itinerary-Vietnam.html,April Itinerary,crellston,UK,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/crellston?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,200,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,50,50.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,25000,"[""['whilst',"", ""'advocate',"", ""'spend',"", ""'3',"", ""'nights',"", ""'place',"", ""'basis',"", ""'allow',"", ""'two',"", ""'full',"", ""'days',"", ""'see',"", ""'stuff',"", ""'occasion',"", ""'road',"", ""'trip',"", ""'quite',"", ""'happy',"", ""'move',"", ""'day',"", ""'journey',"", ""'reward',"", ""'destinations',"", ""'motorcycle',"", ""'drive',"", ""'trip',"", ""'stop',"", ""'place',"", ""'way',"", ""'trip',"", ""'mai',"", ""'chau',"", ""'ninh',"", ""'binh',"", ""'plan',"", ""'spend',"", ""'3',"", ""'days',"", ""'mai',"", ""'chau',"", ""'stay',"", ""'15',"", ""'20',"", ""'lot',"", ""'two',"", ""'homestays',"", ""'multiply',"", ""'something',"", ""'50',"", ""'authentic',"", ""'experience',"", ""'seek',"", ""'way',"", ""'valley',"", ""'away',"", ""'main',"", ""'settlements',"", ""'ninh',"", ""'binh',"", ""'3',"", ""'nights',"", ""'see',"", ""'main',"", ""'sight',"", ""'boat',"", ""'trip',"", ""'mc',"", ""'nb',"", ""'busy',"", ""'domestic',"", ""'tourists',"", ""'weekend',"", ""'time',"", ""'visit',"", ""'mid',"", ""'week',"", ""'two',"", ""'locations',"", ""'spend',"", ""'one',"", ""'night',"", ""'three',"", ""'small',"", ""'villages',"", ""'one',"", ""'night',"", ""'stay',"", ""'right',"", ""'mainly',"", ""'hike',"", ""'part',"", ""'drive',"", ""'motorbike',"", ""'guide',"", ""'imagine',"", ""'experience',"", ""'add',"", ""'extra',"", ""'days',"", ""'cave',"", ""'phong',"", ""'nha',"", ""'ke',"", ""'worth',"", ""'tif',"", ""'add',"", ""'three',"", ""'nights',"", ""'en',"", ""'route',"", ""'hue',"", ""'ninh',"", ""'binh',"", ""'trainquite',"", ""'lot',"", ""'teh',"", ""'area',"", ""'cave',"", ""'amaze',"", ""'travel',"", ""'train',"", ""'prefer',"", ""'vietnam',"", ""'comfortable',"", ""'recommend',"", ""'soft',"", ""'sleeper',"", ""'berth',"", ""'bottom',"", ""'bunk',"", ""'schedule',"", ""'dramatically',"", ""'curtail',"", ""'normal',"", ""'two',"", ""'benefit',"", ""'train',"", ""'travel',"", ""'overnight',"", ""'save',"", ""'nights',"", ""'accommodation',"", ""'live',"", ""'late',"", ""'arrive',"", ""'early',"", ""'morning',"", ""'effectively',"", ""'allow',"", ""'full',"", ""'day',"", ""'end']""]",True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
82,8516,VN,"thanks info.
yes, sound usually road, means driving lot, mostly freedom unmatched train travel, stop anytime need to.
anyways, decide much time spend mai chau/ninh binh, travel places. motorbike seems preferred option, i'll see alone accompanied.
i thought phong nha caves, feel that's must needs, i'm sure photo opportunities are, put itinerary.
yeah, reckon planning trains services right much sense, timetables change situation does.
i'll see.
thank","thanks for the info.
yes, that does sound great and i usually really like being on the road, even if it means driving a lot, mostly because that freedom is unmatched by train travel, and you can stop anytime you need to.
anyways, i still have to decide how much time to spend in mai chau/ninh binh, and how to travel between the places. motorbike seems the preferred option, but i'll see if alone of accompanied.
i have thought about the phong nha caves, but i don't feel like that's a must for my needs, and since i'm not sure what photo opportunities there are, i didn't put it in the itinerary.
yeah, i reckon planning the trains and other services right now doesn't make much sense, as the timetables will change when the situation does.
i'll see.

i understand the tourist industry is very complicated, having once lived in a 'touristy' area. we needed them because it was pretty much the only way to make a living.
as of yet, we haven't really made any decisions. if we do decide on mull, then i recognise we are going to have to book quite a while ahead, and may still be disappointed. then again, mull isn't going anywhere, and neither are we (we hope), so there will always be another year.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g186584-i1964-k13604751-Visiting_mull_during_time_of_covid-Isle_of_Mull_The_Hebrides_Scotland.html,visiting mull during time of covid,janet a,sheffield england,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/2seniorsontour?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,50,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,200.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,50.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,25000,"[""['head',"", ""'everybody',"", ""'motorhome',"", ""'challenge',"", ""'single',"", ""'lane',"", ""'roads',"", ""'mull',"", ""'fair',"", ""'mull',"", ""'many',"", ""'roads',"", ""'highlands',"", ""'fact',"", ""'many',"", ""'people',"", ""'road',"", ""'motorhome',"", ""'days',"", ""'loan',"", ""'motorhome',"", ""'road',"", ""'trip',"", ""'stay',"", ""'bbs',"", ""'discover',"", ""'world',"", ""'wife',"", ""'stay',"", ""'bb',"", ""'accommodation',"", ""'price',"", ""'outrageous',"", ""'tourist',"", ""'industry',"", ""'complicate',"", ""'live',"", ""'touristy',"", ""'area',"", ""'pretty',"", ""'much',"", ""'way',"", ""'live',"", ""'decisions',"", ""'mull',"", ""'recognise',"", ""'book',"", ""'quite',"", ""'ahead',"", ""'may',"", ""'disappoint',"", ""'mull',"", ""'isnt',"", ""'neither']""]",False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

otherwise, options include - plug into the wifi and stream, or get a room at a transit hotel if your stop is long enough and use the tv. football of this level is fairly popular so it may be on. you will need to talk to the hotels to get what tv channels they provide and search those channels for if they carry the match.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g294265-i1748-k13570827-Euro_Football_in_Changi_Airport_T3-Singapore.html,Euro Football in Changi Airport T3,Myrm,UK,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/myrm?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,50,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,200,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,200,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,42500,"[""['transit',"", ""'system',"", ""'loosen',"", ""'much',"", ""'ongoing',"", ""'deep',"", ""'clean',"", ""'increase',"", ""'stringency',"", ""'control',"", ""'measure',"", ""'opportunity',"", ""'transit',"", ""'new',"", ""'zealand',"", ""'brunei',"", ""'australia',"", ""'mainland',"", ""'china',"", ""'shuffle',"", ""'plane',"", ""'designate',"", ""'transit',"", ""'hold',"", ""'area',"", ""'screen',"", ""'visible',"", ""'designate',"", ""'area',"", ""'show',"", ""'options',"", ""'include',"", ""'plug',"", ""'wifi',"", ""'stream',"", ""'room',"", ""'transit',"", ""'hotel',"", ""'stop',"", ""'long',"", ""'tv',"", ""'football',"", ""'level',"", ""'fairly',"", ""'popular',"", ""'may',"", ""'talk',"", ""'hotels',"", ""'tv',"", ""'channel',"", ""'provide',"", ""'search',"", ""'channel',"", ""'carry',"", ""'match']""]",False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

for anyone else interested, i actually contacted changi and didn't expect a reply, at least so quickly - but here is the official reponse:
thank you for your enquiry sent on 07 june 2021.
changi airport has implemented safety measurement measures in which transit passengers will be segregated to 2 different piers within the departure transit hall depending on the countries that they will be arriving from - unilateral opening (uo) countries (lower risk) and non- unilateral opening (non- uo) countries (higher risk).
transit passengers that are arriving from non- uo countries will be escorted from their arrival gate to the transit holding area (tha) to wait for their connecting flight. and they will not be allowed to leave the tha unless if they have a confirmation for a room reservation at our transit hotels - aerotel transit hotel (terminal 1) or ambassador transit hotel (terminal 3).
and for transit passengers that are arriving from uo countries, although they will not be escorted upon arrival, they will not be allowed to leave their piers. kindly also note that due to the airport closure to the public until the 13 june 2021, only certain retail stores, f & b outlets and facilities/ services will continue to operate. hence, we regret to inform that there is no facility at changi airport for you to watch the football game during your layover in singapore.
i hope that the information provided clarifies your enquiry. please do not hesitate to contact us if you have any further questions.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g294265-i1748-k13570827-Euro_Football_in_Changi_Airport_T3-Singapore.html,Euro Football in Changi Airport T3,Sean S,VN,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/seanstokes1989?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,100,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,100,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,100,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,100,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,100,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,50000,"[""['reply',"", ""'saw',"", ""'myrm',"", ""'stream',"", ""'dream',"", ""'interest',"", ""'contact',"", ""'changi',"", ""'expect',"", ""'reply',"", ""'least',"", ""'quickly',"", ""'official',"", ""'reponse',"", ""'enquiry',"", ""'send',"", ""'07',"", ""'june',"", ""'changi',"", ""'airport',"", ""'implement',"", ""'safety',"", ""'measurement',"", ""'measure',"", ""'transit',"", ""'passengers',"", ""'segregate',"", ""'2',"", ""'different',"", ""'piers',"", ""'departure',"", ""'transit',"", ""'hall',"", ""'countries',"", ""'arrive',"", ""'unilateral',"", ""'open',"", ""'uo',"", ""'countries',"", ""'lower',"", ""'risk',"", ""'non',"", ""'unilateral',"", ""'open',"", ""'non',"", ""'uo',"", ""'countries',"", ""'higher',"", ""'risk',"", ""'transit',"", ""'passengers',"", ""'arrive',"", ""'non',"", ""'uo',"", ""'countries',"", ""'escort',"", ""'arrival',"", ""'gate',"", ""'transit',"", ""'hold',"", ""'area',"", ""'tha',"", ""'wait',"", ""'connect',"", ""'flight',"", ""'allow',"", ""'tha',"", ""'confirmation',"", ""'room',"", ""'reservation',"", ""'transit',"", ""'hotels',"", ""'aerotel',"", ""'transit',"", ""'hotel',"", ""'terminal',"", ""'1',"", ""'ambassador',"", ""'transit',"", ""'hotel',"", ""'terminal',"", ""'3',"", ""'transit',"", ""'passengers',"", ""'arrive',"", ""'uo',"", ""'countries',"", ""'escort',"", ""'upon',"", ""'arrival',"", ""'allow',"", ""'piers',"", ""'kindly',"", ""'note',"", ""'due',"", ""'airport',"", ""'closure',"", ""'public',"", ""'13',"", ""'june',"", ""'certain',"", ""'retail',"", ""'store',"", ""'f',"", ""'b',"", ""'outlets',"", ""'facilities',"", ""'service',"", ""'continue',"", ""'operate',"", ""'hence',"", ""'regret',"", ""'inform',"", ""'facility',"", ""'changi',"", ""'airport',"", ""'watch',"", ""'football',"", ""'game',"", ""'layover',"", ""'singapore',"", ""'information',"", ""'provide',"", ""'clarify',"", ""'enquiry',"", ""'hesitate',"", ""'contact',"", ""'question']""]",False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

i would certainly stay in the marina when you are visiting the expo (we stay at that end of town when working on the airshow at dwc to cut down travel time) and then think about the park hyatt for some r+r afterwards. its quite lovely...",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g295424-i872-k13477892-Location_comparison_Grosvenor_House_vs_Park_Hyatt-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html,Location comparison: Grosvenor House vs Park Hyatt,Sean R,UK,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/275seanr?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,100,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,100,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,20000,"[""['different',"", ""'hotels',"", ""'completely',"", ""'park',"", ""'hyatt',"", ""'much',"", ""'resort',"", ""'feel',"", ""'golf',"", ""'course',"", ""'water',"", ""'gro',"", ""'house',"", ""'marina',"", ""'directly',"", ""'lot',"", ""'good',"", ""'options',"", ""'end',"", ""'town',"", ""'marina',"", ""'visit',"", ""'expo',"", ""'little',"", ""'easier',"", ""'gro',"", ""'house',"", ""'stay',"", ""'marina',"", ""'visit',"", ""'expo',"", ""'stay',"", ""'end',"", ""'town',"", ""'work',"", ""'airshow',"", ""'dwc',"", ""'cut',"", ""'travel',"", ""'time',"", ""'park',"", ""'hyatt',"", ""'rr',"", ""'afterwards',"", ""'quite']""]",False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

123,9701,TH,"tourists allowed country, required quarantine 15 nights, start playing tourist 16th day country. done quarantine free travel wherever wish within thailand. plan month long stay (or longer) worth it, short stays practical yet.
the online posts news resort bubbles misleading ideas that, ideas. never made fruition. closest got approved ""golf quarantine"" allowed room day play round golf quarantine period.
sadly bloggers news media bother updating stories whether ideas got approved. simply leave wishful thinking causing confusion.","tourists are allowed in the country, but they are required to quarantine for 15 nights, you start playing tourist on your 16th day in country. but once done with quarantine you are free to travel wherever you wish within thailand. if you plan a month long stay (or longer) it maybe worth it, but short stays are not practical yet.
the online posts and news about resort bubbles are misleading as those ideas were just that, ideas. they never made it to fruition. the closest thing that got approved is ""golf quarantine"" where you are allowed out of your room once a day to play a round of golf by yourself during the quarantine period.
sadly bloggers and news media don't bother updating stories as to whether or not the ideas got approved. they simply leave the wishful thinking out there causing confusion.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g293915-i3686-k13493753-Is_Thailand_open-Thailand.html,Is Thailand open?,MrCycling 🚵‍♂️,US,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrCycling?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,100,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,100,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,20000,"[""['tourists',"", ""'allow',"", ""'country',"", ""'require',"", ""'quarantine',"", ""'15',"", ""'nights',"", ""'start',"", ""'play',"", ""'tourist',"", ""'16th',"", ""'day',"", ""'country',"", ""'quarantine',"", ""'free',"", ""'travel',"", ""'wherever',"", ""'wish',"", ""'thailand',"", ""'plan',"", ""'month',"", ""'long',"", ""'stay',"", ""'longer',"", ""'worth',"", ""'short',"", ""'stay',"", ""'practical',"", ""'online',"", ""'post',"", ""'news',"", ""'resort',"", ""'bubble',"", ""'mislead',"", ""'ideas',"", ""'ideas',"", ""'fruition',"", ""'closest',"", ""'approve',"", ""'golf',"", ""'quarantine',"", ""'allow',"", ""'room',"", ""'day',"", ""'play',"", ""'round',"", ""'golf',"", ""'quarantine',"", ""'period',"", ""'sadly',"", ""'bloggers',"", ""'news',"", ""'media',"", ""'bother',"", ""'update',"", ""'stories',"", ""'whether',"", ""'ideas',"", ""'approve',"", ""'simply',"", ""'wishful',"", ""'cause',"", ""'confusion']""]",False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

the advice above about lyme disease is very pertinent because it is on the rise in scotland and the strains most common here are the more full-on/unpleasant variety, so being aware of the signs is wise as it is fully treatable in its early stages.

please feel free to ask any questions about my experience so far (i've got a whole lot of nothing going on...haha); i am happy to help ease any concerns about arriving. it was nothing compared to what i'd been led to expect by what i was reading. the us airport was far more stringent than heathrow; my arrival this time at heathrow was easier and shorter than a previous arrival.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g186338-i17-k13588890-Trip_Report_2_First_Quarantine_Phone_Call-London_England.html,Trip Report 2: First Quarantine Phone Call,Melissa R.,0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MelissaR0123?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,300,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,30000,"[""['recd',"", ""'quarantine',"", ""'phone',"", ""'call',"", ""'today',"", ""'excite',"", ""'read',"", ""'months',"", ""'subscriber',"", ""'british',"", ""'newspaper',"", ""'tip',"", ""'tempest',"", ""'name',"", ""'paper',"", ""'call',"", ""'1130',"", ""'accent',"", ""'hard',"", ""'keep',"", ""'repeat',"", ""'sound',"", ""'scottish',"", ""'word',"", ""'sound',"", ""'irish',"", ""'finally',"", ""'liverpool',"", ""'tell',"", ""'husband',"", ""'huge',"", ""'liverpool',"", ""'soccer',"", ""'fan',"", ""'password',"", ""'liverpool',"", ""'something',"", ""'liverpool',"", ""'supporter',"", ""'patiently',"", ""'repeat',"", ""'phone',"", ""'speaker',"", ""'help',"", ""'concern',"", ""'miss',"", ""'call',"", ""'shower',"", ""'asleep',"", ""'wake',"", ""'today',"", ""'11',"", ""'worry',"", ""'call',"", ""'call',"", ""'day',"", ""'whole',"", ""'script',"", ""'read',"", ""'confirm',"", ""'person',"", ""'airport',"", ""'procedure',"", ""'test',"", ""'post',"", ""'reply',"", ""'info',"", ""'feel',"", ""'free',"", ""'question',"", ""'experience',"", ""'far',"", ""'whole',"", ""'lot',"", ""'onhaha',"", ""'happy',"", ""'help',"", ""'ease',"", ""'concern',"", ""'arrive',"", ""'lead',"", ""'expect',"", ""'read',"", ""'airport',"", ""'far',"", ""'stringent',"", ""'heathrow',"", ""'arrival',"", ""'time',"", ""'heathrow',"", ""'easier',"", ""'shorter',"", ""'previous',"", ""'arrival']""]",False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

and photos area ","okay a bit more :-) one option for a day out would be to head west from fort william on the mallaig road. just outside fort william you have neptunes staircase which is a fascinating piece of engineering and great to watch the boats going up and down the canal and you also get a great view of ben nevis. then carry on driving along the side of loch linnhe and beyond until you come to glenfinnan where you have the glenfinnan monument, the viaduct made even more famous by the harry potter films, a gorgeous loch and stunning scenery. there are also several nice walks around glenfinnan that i can give you details of and there are also excellent boat trips along loch shiel  the carry on and look out for the sign to the princes cairn and on to arisaig. go in to the village where there is an important war memorial at the front and then take the old coastal road to morar where the coastline is just stunning as are the beaches and coves. you will no doubt make numerous photo stops but be sure to stop and park up at the car park for camusdarach beach. walk through the sand dunes to the gorgeous beach and from there you can walk back along numerous small beaches and coves.
then carry on the the silver sands of morar which is another stunning beach. then carry on but then almost cross straight over the main road and go in to the village of morar and park near the level crossing and take a walk up to the old cross, not to see the cross specifically but the views from there down to the bay as well as in all directions are simply breathtaking. then head in to the little fishing village of mallaig for a wonder round the harbour and a bite to eat if you want before heading back to base.
the glenfinnan house hotel in glenfinnan (funnily enough haha) is also in a great location and the food and service is superb. for an idea of the route and distances have a look at

i had to look into a golf day a few years back for a corporate client with a range of handicaps and from memory the track at meydan was pretty 'welcoming to inexperienced golfers'. in the end, the vips played the majlis and the rest of the crowd went on a tour to the old town! i think everyone had a great afternoon as a consequence! lots of floodlit play too which is quite atmospheric (and a couple of degrees cooler).
another option you could consider would be a lesson for you all with the pro and then just hit some balls before retiring to have a couple of cold ones in the shade followed by lunch or breakfast or even a friday brunch.

i’m starting to plan a trip for january 2022 - early i know but i need something to look forward to! i would appreciate any feedback on my plans so far.
our wish list is winter sun, golf for my husband and culture for me. we will have 10 full days and a moderate budget.
hotel wise, location and price are most important. i would prefer to stay in the old town and i am currently leaning towards the hyatt place dubai baniyas square. it looks to be close to the metro, creek and the souks and an easy journey to the bus station in bur dubai. it looks like there are places to eat close by and as a bonus it has a roof top pool and a beach shuttle. it seems to tick all my boxes and seems very reasonable at 2385aed for 10 nights b&b. any thoughts would be appreciated.
timewise i am thinking 4 days seeing dubai, 3 days golfing or maybe 2 days and 1 evening -the views from the faldo course at night look amazing, a couple of days at al mazmar beach and a day trip to the grand mosque in abu dhabi.
we plan to get about by metro and abras and taxis if need be, we’re happy walking but i appreciate dubai isn’t the most walking friendly city.
i’m not sure how best to group things together and would welcome any advice planning my days, as a starting point i’m thinking –
1) dubai museum, al fahidi and al seefa
2) dubai mall, burj khalifa and dubai fountain
3) can jumeriah mosque and jbr walk be done together? can the canal be easily accessed on this day for a walk towards business bay?
4) can the marina and ain dubai – assuming it’s open by then – be done together? i believe i can get a ferry back to the creek from the marina?
i’m thinking evenings for the souks and creekside walks.
i’m not sure where to fit in the dubai frame?, it seems to be out on a limb?
any suggestions or improvements on my plans would be very welcome.
many thanks.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g295424-i872-k13504317-Help_with_plans-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html,help with plans,catlangenhoe,langenhoe england,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/catlangenhoe?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,134,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,134,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,300,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,134,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,56934,"[""['i’m',"", ""'start',"", ""'plan',"", ""'trip',"", ""'january',"", ""'2022',"", ""'early',"", ""'something',"", ""'feedback',"", ""'plan',"", ""'far',"", ""'wish',"", ""'winter',"", ""'sun',"", ""'golf',"", ""'husband',"", ""'culture',"", ""'10',"", ""'full',"", ""'days',"", ""'moderate',"", ""'budget',"", ""'hotel',"", ""'wise',"", ""'location',"", ""'price',"", ""'important',"", ""'prefer',"", ""'stay',"", ""'old',"", ""'town',"", ""'lean',"", ""'hyatt',"", ""'place',"", ""'dubai',"", ""'baniyas',"", ""'square',"", ""'close',"", ""'metro',"", ""'creek',"", ""'souks',"", ""'easy',"", ""'journey',"", ""'bus',"", ""'station',"", ""'bur',"", ""'dubai',"", ""'place',"", ""'eat',"", ""'close',"", ""'bonus',"", ""'roof',"", ""'top',"", ""'pool',"", ""'beach',"", ""'shuttle',"", ""'tick',"", ""'box',"", ""'reasonable',"", ""'2385aed',"", ""'10',"", ""'nights',"", ""'bb',"", ""'thoughts',"", ""'timewise',"", ""'4',"", ""'days',"", ""'see',"", ""'dubai',"", ""'3',"", ""'days',"", ""'golf',"", ""'2',"", ""'days',"", ""'1',"", ""'view',"", ""'faldo',"", ""'course',"", ""'night',"", ""'amaze',"", ""'couple',"", ""'days',"", ""'al',"", ""'mazmar',"", ""'beach',"", ""'day',"", ""'trip',"", ""'grand',"", ""'mosque',"", ""'abu',"", ""'dhabi',"", ""'plan',"", ""'metro',"", ""'abras',"", ""'taxis',"", ""'we’re',"", ""'happy',"", ""'walk',"", ""'dubai',"", ""'isn’t',"", ""'walk',"", ""'friendly',"", ""'city',"", ""'i’m',"", ""'group',"", ""'together',"", ""'welcome',"", ""'advice',"", ""'plan',"", ""'days',"", ""'start',"", ""'point',"", ""'i’m',"", ""'1',"", ""'dubai',"", ""'museum',"", ""'al',"", ""'fahidi',"", ""'al',"", ""'seefa',"", ""'2',"", ""'dubai',"", ""'mall',"", ""'burj',"", ""'khalifa',"", ""'dubai',"", ""'fountain',"", ""'3',"", ""'jumeriah',"", ""'mosque',"", ""'jbr',"", ""'walk',"", ""'together',"", ""'canal',"", ""'easily',"", ""'access',"", ""'day',"", ""'walk',"", ""'business',"", ""'bay',"", ""'4',"", ""'marina',"", ""'dubai',"", ""'assume',"", ""'it’s',"", ""'open',"", ""'together',"", ""'ferry',"", ""'creek',"", ""'marina',"", ""'i’m',"", ""'souks',"", ""'creekside',"", ""'walk',"", ""'i’m',"", ""'fit',"", ""'dubai',"", ""'frame',"", ""'limb',"", ""'suggestions',"", ""'improvements',"", ""'plan',"", ""'welcome',"", ""'many']""]",False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

many thanks help.","thank you very much hannah,
i'm going to go with your idea of staying at two different hotels and your suggestion of barsha heights, tryp by wyndham at barsha heights is my first choice at the moment. it looks to be close to a metro? is within budget and has good reviews.
can i just check which base you would recommend for the various sights and activities. i'm guessing baniyas square -for the dubai museum, al fahidi, al seef, bur dubai souks and bastakiya ,the deira souks,the creek and creek golf course.
is it easier to go to abu dhabi from here getting the bus from the bus station in bur dubai?
i'm now considering going to the frame on the day we arrive to get a good first view of the city and that will probably be enough after a night flight,
i'm guessing barsha heights is best for the emirates golf course and the jumeriah estate, the burg al khalifa, the marina ,jumeriah mosque - i think we will do the tour- and the canal?
i'm still a bit unsure of where we can get on to the canal to see the waterfall bridge, is it by jumeriah beach?

meanwhile.... the numbers went up for infections in tokyo today (as compared to last week). we're down to one month before the olympics. good luck in figuring out what happens to your tickets (if you live in japan).

and.... there are many new cases at the soccer games in south america (copa america). the g7 meeting brought more positives in cornwall and nearby counties. england (soccer) will probably tell us more in 2 weeks.
the mayor of chiba (soccer) requested no spectators for the night games (which are all night games). the local people are asked to stay home after 8 pm. why is the olympics an exception?
because nbc is broadcasting to the world, most of the events are held at night. the opening ceremony is from 8 pm to 10 pm! ""tokyo"" says no restaurants should stay open passed 8 pm! so we need to go home! but 20,000+ spectators can stay out until 10...and later????

many thanks","hi all!
i am currently a student in oxford and have 6 more months until graduation, but i haven't explored the uk as much as i want to due to covid. anyway, i've decided to go on a one-week road trip starting on april 12 because then travel restrictions will be lifted in the areas i'm considering.
the only thing that i definitely want to do is drive on the black mountain pass in wales and explore brecon beacons park while i'm there. other than that, i have no plan and i'm hoping to get your suggestions on how to spend the remainder of my trip.
my main interests are nature and sightseeing and i don't mind long drives. candidates of places i might want to visit/stop at include snowdonia, cotswolds, and bath but i'm not entirely sure.
any recommendations on which roads to take and places to stop by in wales and the west of england?
many thanks",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g186216-i15-k13517014-One_week_road_trip_sowthwest_UK-United_Kingdom.html,One-week road trip sowthwest UK,GravitasM,0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GravitasM?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,100,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,100,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,100,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,100.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,40000,"[""['student',"", ""'oxford',"", ""'6',"", ""'months',"", ""'graduation',"", ""'explore',"", ""'uk',"", ""'much',"", ""'due',"", ""'covid',"", ""'one',"", ""'week',"", ""'road',"", ""'trip',"", ""'start',"", ""'april',"", ""'12',"", ""'travel',"", ""'restrictions',"", ""'lift',"", ""'areas',"", ""'drive',"", ""'black',"", ""'mountain',"", ""'pass',"", ""'wales',"", ""'explore',"", ""'brecon',"", ""'beacon',"", ""'park',"", ""'plan',"", ""'hop',"", ""'suggestions',"", ""'spend',"", ""'remainder',"", ""'trip',"", ""'main',"", ""'interest',"", ""'nature',"", ""'sightsee',"", ""'mind',"", ""'long',"", ""'drive',"", ""'candidates',"", ""'place',"", ""'visit',"", ""'stop',"", ""'include',"", ""'snowdonia',"", ""'cotswolds',"", ""'bath',"", ""'entirely',"", ""'recommendations',"", ""'roads',"", ""'place',"", ""'stop',"", ""'wales',"", ""'west',"", ""'england',"", ""'many']""]",False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

---the reason bad guys vietnam used bad acts foreign travelers hungry targets victims due decreasing foreign travelers vietnam target foreign travelers intense violence 's needed purpose.
so new coronavirus problem ends , vietnam safe was, think.
(ta2018)","many ta users here are mixing ""good"" with ""bad"" , ""safe"" with ""not safe""=dangerous --so i estimate that their visiting vietnam was not many but few tims only (the least, only once!) but it's never enough to say "" safe"" or ""not safe""!
well, vietnam ""was"" a safe country for our lives but a dangerous country for our money (& goods) and it's started from the beginning of 1,990's after vietnam government officially opened vietnam to foreign people and vietnam got a position of a king of money crimes among all sea countries and has not left it to other sea countries till today!
typical money crimes in vietnam
rips-off, scammings, overchargings(, thefts, pickpocketings, snatchings on the road, taxi scams, cyclo scams, bus scams, sleeper bus scams(the worst bus scams), money exchanging scams(on the road),
tour companiy's scamsby fake or bad quality tour companies , ""honda girl"" scams with threatening togerher with bad guys after s** with her etc.
---()don't mix with overchargings at markets, shops etc because overchargings at those places are a kind of ""game""s in which you may lose ""the game"" or win ""the game"" and you can stop ""the game"" from yourself at anytime.
---but other overchargings as money crimes to foreign travelers are unilaterally set up from the other side so diificult to avoid from yourself.
anyway, such a travel circumstance--good and bad-- in vietnam will change after new coronavirus problem ends and the signs of it are already appearing at some famous tourist destination in vietnam last year.
---russian tourists were attacked by bad guys with machetes (big knives) at separate places in nha trang last year and were seriously damaded and sent to hospitals--a ta user posted about it though it seems to me that many ta users didn't beleive it as a real case because of their too much beleiving of ""vietnam is safe""---but i beleived it because such as serious cases can be possible in vietnam now where new coronavirus is blocking foreign travelers to enter into vietnam except from russia, china etc.
---the reason is bad guys in vietnam who used to do bad acts to foreign travelers are very hungry now to get their targets and victims due to decreasing of foreign travelers to vietnam so they have to target to very few foreign travelers and use intense violence if it 's needed for their purpose.
so after new coronavirus problem ends , vietnam is not always safe as it was, i think.

"" leaving us with 2 nights to fill......""
you could visit either tam coc (ninh binh province) or mai chau (hoa binh province) as an overnight journey, but i would hire (rent) a car and driver / english-speaking guide, and make a road trip out of it.
take a look at google maps (in satellite view)/ earth and look for sites/sites that might appeal to you. google earth makes it easy as many points of interest are clearly marked.
you might also do some research on moc chau (mộc châu) district of son la province which is roughly 70km from mai chau. moc chau is a mountainous destination known for tea fields and beautiful natural scenery.
this is an area i am particularly interested in:

it's just up the road with these tea fields that are very popular with local (domestic) tourists.

this is hmong territory and they still take their traditional ways of life very seriously. you'll probably see the older gals out grazing their livestock in the tea fields dressed in full-on traditional costume. typical rural far northern vietnam, like (most of) sa pa, bac ha, or mu cang chai districts, but not so far from hanoi.

edited: 1:00 am, february 15,","i served with the 170th ahc out of camp holloway in pleiku, vietnam and flew down to the 155th ahc's (stagecoach) airfield just north of ban me thuot many times in 1968. about two thirds of the way down, you'd be crossing over dense jungle with what looked like large open grassy areas which we called the devil's golf course. it was an area where elephants roamed or so we thought.
much of my flying was done in support of the special forces. on one occasion, probably around august, i got into ban me thuot in the late afternoon and my peter pilot and i were taken by jeep to a special forces compound which we were told had been teddy roosevelt's hunting lodge. it consisted of at least one large large thached long house set 10 feet or so atop large wooden pilings. we spent the night there as guests of the 1st sgt or sgt major and flew out the next day.

may 31st, government-owned vietnam airlines announced they would trial the iata travel pass. i assume they would have sought government approval. last week vietjet said they would also participate. i suppose they'll start with selected passengers on repatriation flights .
i think the phu quoc trial will be short package trips from, probably, south korea using charter flights, staying in resorts with access to a beach, maybe a golf course, but no travel around the island. it will be interesting to see the response.
phu quoc may have already made some arrangements and even had them approved by the tourism and transport ministries, as quang nam has done, but the ministry of health hasn't finalised requirements. it will take time and i agree with manatdollar that any start will likely be after the summer monsoon.

cheers ross","the mui ne area is best accessed by car or train from hcmc. personally i like the train as you do feel like you are getting somewhere. after the freeway sections out of hcmc the roadtrip is very slow and boring.
comparing mui ne to da nang and hoi an the difference is stark. mui ne is a smaller laidback type of place compared to the fully developed da nang/hoi an. you could of course sample mui ne on the way north travelling mui ne-nha trang-da nang- hoi an. this would give you a good coastal experience in vietnam.
you need to take into account the heat during july/august. it is pretty debilitating between 11 and 3.

glad to learn that you’re going to beautiful maui. we are going nowhere and are still waiting for our first vaccine shot! our routine badminton game (twice a week) has been put on halt as the court is closed till further notice! like you all we could do these days is to take a 1-hour daily walk. the only compensation we have is being able to see some cherry blossom in a small park not too far from our house during the last few days.

as already mentioned you can hire a local with a jukung. it is easy to hire one of these on a short term basis. couple of hours.. as mentioned some hire them for fishing trips and many of the larger jukungs are advertised for fishing trips but you can of course do what you want.
prices will vary a lot. a small narrow traditional jukung with a 3 foot beam used for fishing for idr300k for a few hours.
if you wanted something bigger/more comfortable your problem is that these are often offered for rental on a half or full day basis.

this is not like the uk where you can pick and choose eg stay at home or stay in an airbnb or hotel of your choice but you can only stay within the specific asq places and what i gather is for the first 7 days you are confined to your room thereafter you are allowed out for one hour but to stay within approved areas in the hotel grounds.
the problem i envisage is unless the golf course is for the exclusive use of quarantined customers there is potentially abeit only small the risk of cross infection.

how often did you hand things back and forth with staff during the 14 days quarantine?
how often were you within 2 metres of the staff during your 14 day quarantine?
the links provided above above state caddies may be provided upon request.
i was under the impression that asq involved isolation in a hotel room with a 1 hour/day outside the after the first test. the 1 hour outside for again in isolation.
the idea of doing a round of with other people in quarantine and caddies seems somewhat at odds with asq in a hotel.
quite a few people in asq in thailand and in hotel quarantine in australia have been found to infected. hotel staff have contracted the virus from working in hotel quarantine.
people must really like playing golf to play a round of golf potentially every day with people in quarantine.
i think i would stay in my room in asq.
i would doing my best not to associate with others undertaking quarantine as i would view them as potentially being infected as i would assume that is why they are in quarantine. as i understand that is why i would be in quarantine.
caddies in ppe must be sight to see.

i have not seen the idea of golfing quarantine brought up in australia or nz.

i am a master's student in oxford with 6 months left until graduation, but, unfortunately, i haven't had many chances to explore beautiful england due to covid. so, i've decided to go on a one-week road trip starting on april 12 because then many restrictions will be lifted in england.
my main interests are nature and sightseeing and i don't mind long drives.
after some research, i found the following cornwall itinerary but i'm not sure whether it's suitable for this time of year and whether it encompasses the most scenic spots in the area.. so how would you change it?
day 1 | lost gardens of heligan – portloe – falmouth
day 2 | cadgwith cove – lizard’s point – kynance cove
day 3 | st michael’s mount – land’s end
day 4 | sennen cove – cape cornwall – zennor
day 5 | st ives – padstow via the beaches
day 6 | port isaac – tintagel
day 7 | the atlantic highway
also, there are many routes from oxford to lost gardens of heligan, which one is the most pleasurable, and are there places worth stopping at along this route?
if you don't think that cornwall is a good idea, please let me know if there are alternative one-week, nature-focused, solo-friendly road trips in england that you recommend.
note: a few days ago i made another post asking about a road trip in wales but some respondents, who i'm grateful to, dissuaded me, and it seems like a good idea to postpone it, especially that england will allow outdoor dining while wales will not (which is a deal-breaker for me as i'm traveling alone).

i think they have a facebook page as well.
i reckon they might be a better bet and you can phone them with a pre-order.
the types of scallop most prevalent in scottish waters live below the low water line and you don't often see them in less than five meters depth, so anything you'd find on a beach would be liable to be unhealthy and inadvisable to eat - most commercial scallop raising takes place between five and twenty meters and dredging is much deeper still.
i don't think anyone is currently actively involved in fishing/harvesting seafood out of durness these days but its been a while since i did marine work and things might well have changed.

they would be one of the places 'd expect to find it, yes. smidge's business model seems to be to sell through specialist retailers /independents and local shops and ime, it is very well represented in places where the midgies are to be found. larger outdoor/mountain sports retailers like tiso, nevisport and millets also sell it.
also, be aware that smidge is not a repellent in the conventional sense. the way it works is like it makes you invisible to the midgies - the first time i took it out was quite disconcerting, they were swarming around me like i'd never seen before - although they had absolutely no inclination to bite me. eventually i got used to it though but if you want to actually drive them away from you, then a deet-based repellent is more the thing.
boots (branches all over the place) is my go-to for deet products - their yellow and silver tin (stronger) repellents are good, well priced (often on bogof) and don't have the same skin and respiratory irritating/synthetic clothing, tent, steering wheel, spectacle, camera, binocular and any other plastic rotting properties of much more expensive brand-name products like jungle formula.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g186525-i108-k13642416-Smidge_or_other_midge_repellent_suggestions_where_to_buy-Edinburgh_Scotland.html,Smidge or other midge repellent suggestions & where to buy?,M8436DHbrians,US,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/M8436DHbrians?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,400,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,225,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,100,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,400,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,101875,"[""['orvis',"", ""'outdoorsy',"", ""'country',"", ""'type',"", ""'retailer',"", ""'hunt',"", ""'shoot',"", ""'fish',"", ""'type',"", ""'place',"", ""'camp',"", ""'mountains',"", ""'fish',"", ""'side',"", ""'lot',"", ""'smaller',"", ""'company',"", ""'reorganisation',"", ""'one',"", ""'place',"", ""'expect',"", ""'smidges',"", ""'business',"", ""'model',"", ""'sell',"", ""'specialist',"", ""'retailers',"", ""'independents',"", ""'local',"", ""'shop',"", ""'ime',"", ""'represent',"", ""'place',"", ""'midgies',"", ""'larger',"", ""'outdoor',"", ""'mountain',"", ""'sport',"", ""'retailers',"", ""'tiso',"", ""'nevisport',"", ""'millets',"", ""'sell',"", ""'aware',"", ""'smidge',"", ""'repellent',"", ""'conventional',"", ""'sense',"", ""'way',"", ""'work',"", ""'invisible',"", ""'midgies',"", ""'time',"", ""'quite',"", ""'disconcert',"", ""'swarm',"", ""'see',"", ""'inclination',"", ""'bite',"", ""'eventually',"", ""'drive',"", ""'away',"", ""'deet',"", ""'base',"", ""'repellent',"", ""'boot',"", ""'branch',"", ""'place',"", ""'deet',"", ""'products',"", ""'yellow',"", ""'silver',"", ""'tin',"", ""'stronger',"", ""'repellents',"", ""'good',"", ""'price',"", ""'bogof',"", ""'skin',"", ""'respiratory',"", ""'irritate',"", ""'synthetic',"", ""'clothe',"", ""'tent',"", ""'steer',"", ""'wheel',"", ""'spectacle',"", ""'camera',"", ""'binocular',"", ""'plastic',"", ""'rot',"", ""'properties',"", ""'much',"", ""'expensive',"", ""'brand',"", ""'name',"", ""'products',"", ""'jungle',"", ""'formula']""]",False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

we haven’t 2014 finally going long-awaited scotland road trip 2020. naturally cancel. initially hoping 2021, point seems way ambitious well.
obviously exactly covid year, wondering thoughts whether september doable?
reading uk’s plan next months, appear international travel might(!) reopen june 2021. read plan uk adult citizens vaccinated end july.
my majority population vaccinated late summer (we hoping vaccinated well), traveling possible - international visitors.
i’m looking book anything won’t able cancel course, wondering whether thoughts realistic september is.
if everyone thinks traveling september highly unrealistic, save trouble booking canceling everything again, there’s optimism, i’d start booking accommodations soon, appears places starting sell fast...
thanks much everyone thoughts/input matter!","hello everybody,
hope everyone is staying safe! my husband and i currently live in georgia, usa. we have been to scotland several times and simply love it over there!
we haven’t been since 2014 and were finally going on a long-awaited scotland road trip in may 2020. naturally we had to cancel. we were initially hoping for may 2021, but at this point that seems way too ambitious as well.
obviously no one can know where exactly covid will take us this year, but i was wondering if anyone maybe had some thoughts on whether september 2021 might be doable?
reading through the uk’s plan for the next few months, it would appear that international travel might(!) reopen in june 2021. i also read that the plan is to have most uk adult citizens vaccinated by the end of july.
my hope is that if the majority of the population is vaccinated by late summer (we are hoping to be vaccinated by then as well), that traveling will once more be possible - even for international visitors.
i’m not looking to book anything we won’t be able to cancel of course, just wondering whether anyone might have thoughts on how realistic september 2021 is.
if everyone thinks traveling by september is highly unrealistic, i may just save us the trouble of booking and then canceling everything again, but if there’s some optimism, i’d like to start booking accommodations soon, as it appears that places are starting to sell out fast...

joanne anderson is not to be confused with joe anderson the previous mayor who stood down in order to assist the police with their enquiries.
maybe just maybe decisions made before joanne anderson took up the post have a bearing on why unesco started to issue warnings a few years ago.
planning permissions have been granted regarding the

most weekends between august and may there is one premiership team playing at home in liverpool
supporters come from far and wide and hotels book out
yes millions of tourists have visited liverpool since it gained whs and if you asked them if they visited on the back of the unesco status - do you think that was the main reason for visiting ?
beatles, liverpool football club - world champs and everton expanding into a new stadium
these docks are largely derelict and have been for 50 years -
the trade has moved on to the container base in deeper water at seaforth further up the mersey
yes there are some interesting features such as the octagonal clock which is worth preserving
the docks are not near the main tourist areas of the pier head and the royal albert dock.

we are looking for a honeymoon holiday for 2 weeks in april 2022, preferably beach based but able to hire a car and explore the area around us. i'm looking for somewhere near to a golf course if possible.
we have looked extensively at the caribbean but not found a hotel with the wow factor.
i don't know much about bali at all. i initially googled golf courses near hotel in bali and it came up with the bali national course in nusa dua. that has been the basis of the search so far.
we have been put off the likes of the maldives and the seychelles because of the limited activities, i would be so bored.
i think wherever we go we would be based there for the full 2 weeks as neither of us are keen to live out of a suitcase or have to repack half way through our trip.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g297698-i9451-k13462214-Honeymoon_recommendations-Nusa_Dua_Nusa_Dua_Peninsula_Bali.html,Honeymoon recommendations,Andrew E,"Colchester, United...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/H6548YGandrewe?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,50,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,50,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,200,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,50,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,200,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,47500,"[""['reply',"", ""'useful',"", ""'honeymoon',"", ""'holiday',"", ""'2',"", ""'weeks',"", ""'april',"", ""'2022',"", ""'preferably',"", ""'beach',"", ""'base',"", ""'able',"", ""'hire',"", ""'car',"", ""'explore',"", ""'area',"", ""'near',"", ""'golf',"", ""'course',"", ""'extensively',"", ""'caribbean',"", ""'hotel',"", ""'wow',"", ""'factor',"", ""'much',"", ""'bali',"", ""'initially',"", ""'google',"", ""'golf',"", ""'course',"", ""'near',"", ""'hotel',"", ""'bali',"", ""'bali',"", ""'national',"", ""'course',"", ""'nusa',"", ""'dua',"", ""'basis',"", ""'search',"", ""'far',"", ""'maldives',"", ""'seychelles',"", ""'limit',"", ""'activities',"", ""'bore',"", ""'wherever',"", ""'base',"", ""'full',"", ""'2',"", ""'weeks',"", ""'neither',"", ""'keen',"", ""'live',"", ""'suitcase',"", ""'repack',"", ""'half',"", ""'way',"", ""'trip']""]",False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

","hi andrew,
although i am fellow digger of large divots i have never played golf in bali. it is very expensive.

at bng if you need to hire clubs by the time you pay for everything easily over £150 a round. many courses caddies compulsory sometimes included in price but expected to tip the caddy. equipment hire not cheap. basic golf set idr500k. sundowner options offer best value but bear in mind in bali sunset is around 6-6:30 pm (doesn’t change much throughout the year as bali is close to the equator).
asyou can imagine playing in heat over 30c, which to some is a higher humidity than they’re used to, isn’t fun. playing golf around europe in similar heat is actually more “comfortable” (even where i live daytime summer temps often in the mid 30c).
bali golf popular with the golf mad japanese who often organise group golf days. ppay can be very slow (over 5 hours)”
there is also a golf course to the north east end of sanur. sanur is more a seaside resort town. lots of beach front hotels but also a “tourist” orientated town with lots of places to eat/drink/shop on the main road jalan danu tamblingan that runs parallel to the beach.
sanur is a laid back place. no nightclubs or pretentious beach clubs.
big choice of hotels. personally like the griya santrian. not just the hotel but location. sister hotel puri santrian is at the other end of sanur.
or like many book yourself a private villa with private pool. can include breakfast if you want or even have staff come in and cook dinner.
have a look at something like 
villas in 3 different locations in sanur. starting prices around us$110 per night for a 1 bedroom private pool villa.
handara golf and country club is in north/central bali and the entrance gate is popular with instagrammers. often a stop on the way to/from ulun danu beratan, wanagiri swings/outlook spot and the big waterfalls in the north.
