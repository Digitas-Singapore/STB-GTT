apart from having the opportunity to choose where to eat and enjoying what is on offer, limiting yourselves to be stuck in a resort dining room for all meals is restricting. as ai is not popular in thailand, you could also discover that you are one of a very few in the dining room with repetitive and unappetising meals.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g293915-i3686-k13540402-All_Inclusive_is_it_worth_it-Thailand.html,All Inclusive is it worth it ?,travelkat88,US,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelkat88?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,100,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,400,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,400,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,85000,"[""['i’m',"", ""'talk',"", ""'pre',"", ""'covid',"", ""'sadly',"", ""'aware',"", ""'way',"", ""'tell',"", ""'many',"", ""'restaurants',"", ""'survive',"", ""'open',"", ""'future',"", ""'others',"", ""'it’s',"", ""'definite',"", ""'ai',"", ""'thailand',"", ""'idea',"", ""'price',"", ""'comparison',"", ""'guess',"", ""'type',"", ""'restaurant',"", ""'apart',"", ""'opportunity',"", ""'eat',"", ""'limit',"", ""'stick',"", ""'resort',"", ""'din',"", ""'room',"", ""'meals',"", ""'restrict',"", ""'ai',"", ""'popular',"", ""'thailand',"", ""'discover',"", ""'one',"", ""'din',"", ""'room',"", ""'repetitive',"", ""'unappetising',"", ""'meals']""]",True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

in searching on the map, i found a lido restaurant and cafe in diera on 10a street. not sure if they have a brunch, but after looking at the location and photos, that's the kind of food i like from northern africa (tunisia) and it's on the bus/metro line. i'm definitely checking that place out. appears to a lot of locals that go there which is fine with me since i like the older part of dubai.

thanks rachel.","hi,
i'm looking to plan a self catering trip the week of 17th may 2021, ideally looking at a log cabin ( but will consider cottage and caravan) preferably with hot tub. thinking for 4 nights but depending on location could be for up to 7 nights. we are an early 30's couple and will be travelling from south west scotland by car.
we got lots of fab advice for our trip to cornwall last year so thought this was best place to come. looking for somewhere in england in a location with plenty to do especially walks etc and plenty of pubs and restaurants. had looked at possibly lake district, chester and cotswold's but open to any advice of nice areas to visit for up to a week.
any help will be very much appreciated :)

i’m currently searching for a campsite in devon which is close to a beach. i know they’re are hundreds of campsites in devon but we prefer smaller, quieter ones than the big holiday parks. we’re in a vw camper. i want to get myself a sup and give that a go (too old for surfing now!) i’ve seen one or 2 near croyde, but also seen warnings that the surf at croyde is not for beginners, and they’ll be me learning to sup and my 8 year old son, so that puts us off.
walking distance to the beach would be ideal if anyone has any recommendations i’d really appreciate it.

agree it’s drop matsuyama takamatsu time. many interesting places mainland honshu worth going couple days. cherry blossom main objective consider spending time osaka kyoto. average year time visit season many beautiful sakura sites osaka kyoto. took spring visit kansai region 2019. let interested elaborate more.
another place often neglected nagoya transport hub train travel. highly worthwhile side trip spectacular illumination event flower park nabana-no-sato easy evening excursion staying night nagoya.","driving in the fuji five lakes region is fine. we had done it twice once in spring and once during fall, just slightly more traffic when we went for autumn foliage. you have planned it well, mid april is a very good time for kawaguchiko as you can enjoy cherry blossom as well as beautiful pink moss. kawaguchiko is holding its annual sakura festival during that time frame, weather permitting of course.
agree it’s better to drop matsuyama and takamatsu this time. there are many interesting places in mainland honshu that are worth going for a couple of days. if cherry blossom is a main objective consider spending more time in osaka and kyoto. in average year your time of visit is in season and there are many beautiful sakura sites in and around osaka and kyoto. we took in some during our spring visit to the kansai region in 2019. do let me know if you are interested and i can elaborate a bit more.
another place often neglected is nagoya which to most is just a transport hub for train travel. a highly worthwhile side trip is the spectacular illumination event in the flower park of nabana-no-sato which is an easy evening excursion if you are staying a night in nagoya.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g294232-i525-k13542015-4_weeks_in_March_2022_second_trip-Japan.html,4 weeks in March 2022 (second trip),William512,CA,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/William512?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,100,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,100,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,100,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,30000,"[""['drive',"", ""'fuji',"", ""'five',"", ""'lakes',"", ""'region',"", ""'fine',"", ""'twice',"", ""'spring',"", ""'fall',"", ""'slightly',"", ""'traffic',"", ""'autumn',"", ""'foliage',"", ""'plan',"", ""'mid',"", ""'april',"", ""'good',"", ""'time',"", ""'kawaguchiko',"", ""'cherry',"", ""'blossom',"", ""'beautiful',"", ""'pink',"", ""'moss',"", ""'kawaguchiko',"", ""'hold',"", ""'annual',"", ""'sakura',"", ""'festival',"", ""'time',"", ""'frame',"", ""'weather',"", ""'permit',"", ""'course',"", ""'it’s',"", ""'drop',"", ""'matsuyama',"", ""'takamatsu',"", ""'time',"", ""'many',"", ""'interest',"", ""'place',"", ""'mainland',"", ""'honshu',"", ""'worth',"", ""'couple',"", ""'days',"", ""'cherry',"", ""'blossom',"", ""'main',"", ""'objective',"", ""'spend',"", ""'time',"", ""'osaka',"", ""'kyoto',"", ""'average',"", ""'time',"", ""'visit',"", ""'season',"", ""'many',"", ""'beautiful',"", ""'sakura',"", ""'sit',"", ""'osaka',"", ""'kyoto',"", ""'spring',"", ""'visit',"", ""'kansai',"", ""'region',"", ""'2019',"", ""'interest',"", ""'elaborate',"", ""'place',"", ""'neglect',"", ""'nagoya',"", ""'transport',"", ""'hub',"", ""'train',"", ""'travel',"", ""'highly',"", ""'worthwhile',"", ""'side',"", ""'trip',"", ""'spectacular',"", ""'illumination',"", ""'event',"", ""'flower',"", ""'park',"", ""'nabana',"", ""'sato',"", ""'easy',"", ""'excursion',"", ""'stay',"", ""'night',"", ""'nagoya']""]",True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

3/5 1am depart
key points to this proposed itinerary:
--landing at 6am, your hotel will most likely only allow you to drop your bags off. hnd airport has paid showers if you are interested. you then need to plan your time to pass the morning until after lunch. asakusa (with or without skytree) and tsukiji market are good candidates
--from 2/19 to 3/4, you can use a 14-day jr pass to cover all jr travels. that means you can use shinkansen or limited express trains to cover many of the rides to izu peninsula, nikko, kanazawa, kyoto-osaka-hiroshima, hakone and even heading towards the airport;
--nabana no sato is not a bad place to visit, but it's not really a ""must"" sort of place either. the park itself is about an hour outside central nagoya;

2. taking train mie prefecture see nabana sato park illuminations.
3. taking train nagano, shirakawago snow. trains crowded going nagano kyoto coming tokyo?
4. going hiroshima/miyajima. unique fly hiroshima haneda fly kansai.
i trying change flight going tokyo looking good! definitely change hotels disney portion closer tokyo station shinjuku. read going disney christmas crowded research that.
thank suggestions!","thank you everyone for your input.
i'm sorry.. i should have been clearer in my original post. my intent is to do only 1 out of the 4 options between tokyo and kyoto:
1. flying from haneda to sapporo on 12/28 then flying from sapporo to kansai on 12/30 to minimize long crowded train trips. is flying really any better?
2. taking the train to mie prefecture to see nabana no sato park illuminations.
3. taking the train to nagano, shirakawago for snow. are the trains just as crowded going from nagano to kyoto as they would be coming from tokyo?
4. going to hiroshima/miyajima. not really unique but we can fly to hiroshima from haneda then fly into kansai.
i am trying to change the flight to one going to tokyo but it's not looking good! i would definitely change hotels after the disney portion to closer to tokyo station or shinjuku. i read that going to disney after christmas is very crowded but i will do more research on that.

i'd say dress in layers (one day in tokyo it was 7°c in the morning and 17°c in the afternoon) and take time to rest and have a hot (or cold) drink.
and if you can, take the shinkansen between tokyo and kyoto and choose seat e (d is fine too) in any of the carriages to get a view of mount fuji from the train; in winter, the sky is more likely to be clear so the chances of seeing mount fuji are greater!
note: look into takuhaibin, the luggage delivery service.

i used them between tokyo and kyoto, making for a hassle-free travel experience on the train (it takes 2 days, if i remember well, for the luggage to arrive so plan accordingly).

i have been training at muay thai for over a year in my own country, so, that is the context of wanting to go. the last 5 years nearly all of my ""holidays"" have actually be training camps to different countries for my previous sport. so, i do like an activity when i travel.
i will be travelling solo, so, an activity helps too. i'd obviously like to visit some museums, see some sights and culture and a little nightlife. but i'm not really interested in the usual backpacker, heavy drinking scene that some of my friends have gone to thailand for.
thanks again, i will research more!

>>and, course, leaning towards many trains, cost effective jr pass
not really. roughly speaking, 14-day jr pass pays round trip b/w tokyo hiroshima shinkansen (on long distance routes) taken within 14 days. note train fares jr express trains cost much less, jr kaiyu azusa serving jr chuo line. besides, daily commutes city subways covered all. thus, value jr pass drops substantially stationing large cities.
if depart osaka/kix, likely overpay lot buying jr pass, cheap.

hida folk village vs shirakawa-go - have visited both. the former is more akin to an open air museum whereas locals have been living in latter for centuries. for those who could not make it to the latter, the former is indeed the next best substitute.
in takayama old town, also check out the yatai kaikan where yatai used in the annual takayama festivals are exhibited.

there is no tunnel nor elbow turns b/w tokyo/shinjuku and kawaguchi-ko along the chuo expressway - validate on google map. unlike bus drivers elsewhere in europe, most bus drivers in japan are way more cautious and seldom make abrupt stops unless it's necessary. besides, in japan the speed limits are much lower - 50km/h on national roads and less than 110km/h on expressways. on average, it hardly steers faster than 80km/h.
indeed, the train option is a viable alternative, though bus ride is comparatively benign. only you can tell if it'd be bearable. sitting behind the bus driver and taking window seats as suggested by sammy are some good ideas to alleviate motion sickness.
train fares b/w shinjuku and kawaguchi-ko for reserved seats cost jpy4,130. refer to route #1 in the link below.

>>and, of course, with my leaning towards so many trains, it might make it more cost effective for us to get the jr pass
not really. roughly speaking, the 14-day jr pass pays off if a round trip b/w tokyo and hiroshima by shinkansen (on long distance routes) is taken within 14 days. note that train fares of jr express trains cost much less, such as jr kaiyu or azusa serving the jr chuo line. besides, daily commutes on city subways are not covered at all. thus, the value of jr pass drops substantially while stationing in large cities.
if you depart from osaka/kix, then it's very likely you'd overpay a lot by buying jr pass, which is not cheap.

thanks help!","hello! we jumped on one of the cheap tokyo flight deals for november with the expectation that we will likely have to push the trip further out... but in the meantime, i love researching and planning trips, and here i am digging through tripadvisor again!
we did an amazing 2 weeks in japan in november 2019 and covered all of the major first-timer places: tokyo, kamakura/enoshima, kyoto, nara, osaka, himeji, hiroshima/miyajima, fukuoka (sumo tournament/nanzoin buddha). disneysea.
now i'm looking for advice on what to do for a second trip! we love doing a bit of everything - covering the most famous stuff, pretty temples/gardens (especially if we are there for fall leaves) again, easy hikes, eating, and just wandering. my husband does japanese calligraphy as a hobby, so we're also looking for museums/classes/shops for his interests.
we are planning to do hakone/mt. fuji area and a few days around kyoto/osaka because there is so much to see and do there (i really want to do the aquarium!). and in my research, i've recently discovered the ""diamond route"" term for fukushima, ibaraki, and tochigi prefectures. since nikko is definitely a place i want to go this time, i was wondering if the other locations are worth spending 3-4 days exploring, something like: tokyo > mito > koriyama > urabandai > aizu-wakamatsu > ouchijuku > nikko > utsunomiya > tokyo?
we would do this ourselves on trains/buses, not through a tour company, but here are example itineraries to illustrate what i'm thinking: 
so any other advice for our second trip itinerary?
days 1-2 tokyo
3-7 diamond route? or just a nikko day trip and then go somewhere else?
8-11 kyoto/osaka - other day trips besides nara to do?
12-14 hakone/mt. fuji
15 tokyo and return flight

in addition, i have not yet worked out just where central tokyo is. but we are there for 6 nights and will be visiting various museums and also taking trains to some inland destinations yet to be decided. many hotels seem to be concentrated close to the river and i believe there is a main station close by as well.
perhaps i should come back in a month or two but i would like to get our hotel settled.
thanks again everyone.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g294232-i525-k13538757-Travel_from_central_Tokyo_to_main_cruise_port-Japan.html,Travel from central Tokyo to main cruise port,Observer2908,Bournemouth,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Observer2908?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,50,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,50,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,50,0,0,0,200,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,27500,"[""['reply',"", ""'hat',"", ""'question',"", ""'enquiry',"", ""'relate',"", ""'cruise',"", ""'12',"", ""'months',"", ""'time',"", ""'terminal',"", ""'announce',"", ""'course',"", ""'late',"", ""'day',"", ""'addition',"", ""'work',"", ""'central',"", ""'tokyo',"", ""'6',"", ""'nights',"", ""'visit',"", ""'various',"", ""'museums',"", ""'train',"", ""'inland',"", ""'destinations',"", ""'many',"", ""'hotels',"", ""'concentrate',"", ""'close',"", ""'river',"", ""'main',"", ""'station',"", ""'close',"", ""'month',"", ""'two',"", ""'hotel',"", ""'settle']""]",True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

edited: 3:41 pm, january 01,","im working on a rough outline of a 3 week itinerary for our first visit to japan, that is bound by set dates at the beginning and toward the end of the trip. the set dates are a sumo wrestling tournament in osaka on mar 28 and the takayama spring festival on apr 14. my husband and i have traveled extensively in asia, but never to japan. we generally prefer to have off the beaten path experiences that highlight natural beauty and culture, and that are combined with visits to must see tourist places. we are not really into big cities. im looking at visiting the following locations, and need advice on how to order the locations to minimize travel times, and also advice on # of full days at a location.
tokyo (fly in and out), perhaps spend one day at the end of the trip before flight home
osaka - 2 days
kyoto - 4 days
shikoku island - 4 days
kanazawa, takayama, shirakawa-go - 2-3 days
izu peninsula - 3-4 days
?? yakushima island - 2-3 days (would love to see the natural beauty of this island. my husband is 74 and i'm 59 and we are in decent physical shape. but with some surgeries we've had, now limit hiking to about 2 miles. would we miss out on what the island offers if we can't do the longer hikes?)
? hakone - 1 day (like the open air museum, but dont know if a stop here makes sense given the other places we are seeing.
thanks for any help.

thank help!","hi all,
so, should we be allowed into the country (we will be fully vaccinated by then but who can tell), my partner and i are planning a 3-week trip to japan for october 2021 (all of the below assumes relative normalcy, backup plan is us west coast if not, with this one then being parked until we can get over to japan).
neither of us have been before (in fact we haven't been further east than istanbul) and we may not be back for a long time. we also haven't been anywhere since nov 2019, so keen to make it a good one!
essential elements for the trip are:
guinea pig bridge (nagasaki bio park)
whale sharks (okinawa chaurami aquarium)
disneyland + disneysea (no weekends)
usj + halloween horror nights (no weekends)

volcanoes, caves, other interesting geology
world war ii history
food (esp. seafood)
anime (esp. studio ghibli, nge, jba)
video games (esp. nintendo)
planes, trains (we work in those industries)
flight prices mean we can practically only have endpoints at tokyo and osaka (essentially tokyo), and we plan to arrive (from the uk) on the evening of 3rd oct, departing late in the evening of 23rd oct. travel in between will be primarily by train (shinkansen/sunrise express mostly), taking advantage of the okinawa flights to get to hokkaido and avoid one long train leg.

yokohama chinatown is not that different from san francisco chinatown, but there are plenty of other things to do in yokohama. in the minato mirai area, there's plenty of shopping, the yokohama museum of art, and the japanese overseas migration museum. you can use the street view function on google maps to ""preview"" chinatown and the minato mirai district. elsewhere in yokohama, there's the sankeien garden. train service (including english signage) from yokohama to tokyo is excellent, although trains are crowded during commute hours. for schedules, see www.hyperdia.com. from yokohama, it would be easy to do a day trip to kamakura. i'm a big fan of yokohama, but if you want to spend most of your time in tokyo, it might make sense to stay in tokyo.
in general, hotels may be cheaper in yokohama than in tokyo. there are a couple of low-priced toyoko inns adjacent to the baseball stadium in yokohama, and there are many other hotels between kannai station and the waterfront.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g298156-i860-k13598872-Transportation_from_Yokohama_to_Tokyo-Kanto.html,Transportation from Yokohama to Tokyo,Bargainhunter,US,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bargainhunter?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,50,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,50,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,50,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,50,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,50,0,0,0,200,50,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,35000,"[""['see',"", ""'yokohama',"", ""'port',"", ""'3',"", ""'piers',"", ""'shinko',"", ""'osanbashi',"", ""'daikoku',"", ""'shinko',"", ""'osanbashi',"", ""'conveniently',"", ""'locate',"", ""'walk',"", ""'distance',"", ""'minato',"", ""'mirai',"", ""'redevelopment',"", ""'area',"", ""'daikoku',"", ""'conveniently',"", ""'locate',"", ""'cruise',"", ""'line',"", ""'may',"", ""'able',"", ""'tell',"", ""'pier',"", ""'port',"", ""'reassign',"", ""'boat',"", ""'closer',"", ""'time',"", ""'trip',"", ""'yokohama',"", ""'chinatown',"", ""'different',"", ""'san',"", ""'francisco',"", ""'chinatown',"", ""'plenty',"", ""'yokohama',"", ""'minato',"", ""'mirai',"", ""'area',"", ""'plenty',"", ""'shop',"", ""'yokohama',"", ""'museum',"", ""'art',"", ""'japanese',"", ""'overseas',"", ""'migration',"", ""'museum',"", ""'street',"", ""'view',"", ""'function',"", ""'google',"", ""'map',"", ""'preview',"", ""'chinatown',"", ""'minato',"", ""'mirai',"", ""'district',"", ""'elsewhere',"", ""'yokohama',"", ""'sankeien',"", ""'garden',"", ""'train',"", ""'service',"", ""'include',"", ""'english',"", ""'signage',"", ""'yokohama',"", ""'tokyo',"", ""'excellent',"", ""'train',"", ""'crowd',"", ""'commute',"", ""'hours',"", ""'schedule',"", ""'see',"", ""'wwwhyperdiacom',"", ""'yokohama',"", ""'easy',"", ""'day',"", ""'trip',"", ""'kamakura',"", ""'big',"", ""'fan',"", ""'yokohama',"", ""'spend',"", ""'time',"", ""'tokyo',"", ""'sense',"", ""'stay',"", ""'tokyo',"", ""'general',"", ""'hotels',"", ""'may',"", ""'cheaper',"", ""'yokohama',"", ""'tokyo',"", ""'couple',"", ""'low',"", ""'price',"", ""'toyoko',"", ""'inns',"", ""'adjacent',"", ""'baseball',"", ""'stadium',"", ""'yokohama',"", ""'many',"", ""'hotels',"", ""'kannai',"", ""'station',"", ""'waterfront']""]",True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

1. day 1: we will be reaching glasgow at around 2 pm. is it possible to cover loch lomond and trossachs national park with public transport during rest of the day? i found we can take the train to balloch and get into sweeny’s cruise for a circular tour of loch lomond. but what about trossachs national park? is its entrance also near balloch station? are we better off going by bus if we plan to cover both? please advise.
2. day 2: day return trip by train from glasgow to mallaig via fort william. i know we will spend 10+ hours in train, but we find the opportunity to experience one of the most scenic routes in the world hard to resist. besides the kids also love train ride, so i believe they will not complain.
3. day 3: this is where i am still undecided. this will be our last day in glasgow and we’re considering a day trip to one of these locations by public transport: isle of arran/ayrshire coast/stirling castle/oban/inverness/st andrews. which one of these do you suggest we should go assuming we will never visit scotland again? :-). we should be ok as long as we return to glasgow by 9 pm. will take the next train to edinburgh that night.
4. day 4: explore edinburgh, of course including the royal mile and edinburgh castle. do you think we can visit arthur’s seat too with the kids? if not, any other suggestion (not too keen on visiting museums)? we have a return train to catch from edinburgh station at around 6 pm. so any suggestions to spend the day in edinburgh will be appreciated.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g186485-i107-k13636655-4_days_in_Scotland_with_kids_and_no_car-Scotland.html,4 days in Scotland with kids and no car,Tansen378,The Royal Town of...,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tansen378?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,50,0,0,0.0,0,200,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,50,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,50,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,50,0,0,0,200,50,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,52500,"[""['everybody',"", ""'suggestions',"", ""'research',"", ""'mind',"", ""'little',"", ""'plan',"", ""'stay',"", ""'3d2n',"", ""'glasgow',"", ""'1n1d',"", ""'edinburgh',"", ""'timberbush',"", ""'tour',"", ""'tour',"", ""'cancel',"", ""'days',"", ""'we’ll',"", ""'glasgow',"", ""'plan',"", ""'suggestions',"", ""'1',"", ""'day',"", ""'1',"", ""'reach',"", ""'glasgow',"", ""'2',"", ""'cover',"", ""'loch',"", ""'lomond',"", ""'trossachs',"", ""'national',"", ""'park',"", ""'public',"", ""'transport',"", ""'rest',"", ""'day',"", ""'train',"", ""'balloch',"", ""'sweeny’s',"", ""'cruise',"", ""'circular',"", ""'tour',"", ""'loch',"", ""'lomond',"", ""'trossachs',"", ""'national',"", ""'park',"", ""'entrance',"", ""'near',"", ""'balloch',"", ""'station',"", ""'bus',"", ""'plan',"", ""'cover',"", ""'2',"", ""'day',"", ""'2',"", ""'day',"", ""'trip',"", ""'train',"", ""'glasgow',"", ""'mallaig',"", ""'via',"", ""'fort',"", ""'william',"", ""'spend',"", ""'10',"", ""'hours',"", ""'train',"", ""'opportunity',"", ""'experience',"", ""'one',"", ""'scenic',"", ""'rout',"", ""'world',"", ""'hard',"", ""'resist',"", ""'besides',"", ""'kid',"", ""'train',"", ""'ride',"", ""'complain',"", ""'3',"", ""'day',"", ""'3',"", ""'undecided',"", ""'day',"", ""'glasgow',"", ""'we’re',"", ""'day',"", ""'trip',"", ""'one',"", ""'locations',"", ""'public',"", ""'transport',"", ""'isle',"", ""'arran',"", ""'ayrshire',"", ""'coast',"", ""'stirling',"", ""'castle',"", ""'oban',"", ""'inverness',"", ""'st',"", ""'andrews',"", ""'one',"", ""'assume',"", ""'visit',"", ""'scotland',"", ""'long',"", ""'glasgow',"", ""'9',"", ""'train',"", ""'edinburgh',"", ""'night',"", ""'4',"", ""'day',"", ""'4',"", ""'explore',"", ""'edinburgh',"", ""'course',"", ""'include',"", ""'royal',"", ""'mile',"", ""'edinburgh',"", ""'castle',"", ""'visit',"", ""'arthur’s',"", ""'seat',"", ""'kid',"", ""'suggestion',"", ""'keen',"", ""'visit',"", ""'museums',"", ""'train',"", ""'catch',"", ""'edinburgh',"", ""'station',"", ""'6',"", ""'suggestions',"", ""'spend',"", ""'day',"", ""'edinburgh']""]",True,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

edited: 7:44 pm, april 08,","three nights is only two full days in cornwall. as you are staying in marazion you will have enough to do in that area to fill your days. one day could be on the lizard visiting cadgwith, lizard village and kynance cove - great pasties from ann’s bakery in lizard village. the other day could be newlyn, mousehole, sennen (walk to land’s end from there and you will miss the worst of the tacky theme park although that is closed), then cape cornwall and botallack with its iconic mine buildings (this area in my opinion is far more atmospheric and interesting than land’s end).
if you choose to go to st ives, don’t try to drive in the old part of the town. you can park at the leisure centre and either walk or take the bus into the town i usually recommend the park and ride for an amazing train journey but public transport is still to be avoided unless necessary.
for your journey towards cornwall you could either spend time on dartmoor as suggested above or visit the lost gardens of heligan but that must be prebooked.
you will be able to see st michael’s mount from marazion but the island is closed to visitors.
as mentioned previously some of the roads in cornwall are very narrow with passing places so reversing may be required if you meet someone. don’t try to drive into the old harbour villages:cadgwith, mousehole, port isaac etc as they were built before cars were invented.

last (month) when i visited kerala there were no rules for covid test,only have to register at jagratha portal if someone in visiting for short trip up to 7 days,if longer then there was rule for quarentine and test.i was there for only 3 nights so no test and quarentine.
as i am indian so after exiting delhi airport 1st thing what we did was to start using aadhar card for any identify need , showing passport with recent arrival stamp was not a good idea anywhere.later i saw that in both tn and kerala before check in a self declaration form need to be fill with a question whether i visited any foreign country in recent days or arrived from overseas in last 7 days, though it was already more than 7 days so didn't needed to write a lie(for tn i m sure but little doubt about kerala)
as you are having non indian passport so you can't hide your arrival by any chance during your visit(and i won't suggest anyone to do or do anything against the rule),you should check kerala rules specifically,may ask in kerala forum.as per goi rule after clearing immigration and custom at delhi you are free to move but then applies rules of particular state.
.after arriving india i had already travelled between 7 states,took 9 domestic flights and every state have own rules and regulations,lots of confusion on the ground.

i got the flight deal for $225 to hnd from dallas, arriving early morning on monday 11/22 and departing mid-morning on wednesday 12/1.
i’d never really seriously considered a trip to japan before because the combo of the expensive flights + reputation as an expensive destination deterred me, but the price was too good to turn down.
there is (hopefully) going to be a sumo tournament in fukuoka while i’m there, so my initial thought was to fly to fukuoka to start and then work my way back north by train/bus.
what should i do? i’m into history and culture, natural beauty, but open to pretty much anything. would like to do a day at universal studios for nintendo+potter world. so that + the sumo are 2 days, and i basically have 7-8 more days to fill. what do i do?
i am a budget traveler so would love hostel or japanese-style guesthouse recs and cheap delicious eats suggestions. i could probably splurge on a nice dinner or two ($50-$100 per person range). i tend to save my money to spend on experiences so any tour suggestions or cool places i would love to hear.
the flights are flexible, and let’s assume that vaccinated travelers are allowed into japan without quarantine (i know that may end up not being the case), and that japan is in the new normal before the most recent lockdown coming up.
would love any itinerary suggestions!

i suppose it depends on a country's stance on whether vaccinated travelers are a risk and how much business/tourist trade is important to them. greece is already reopening to vaccinated americans, though obviously they are culturally different, more economically hard up, and more dependant on tourism than japan. mexico never closed to american tourists, even before vaccination, and doesn't even require a negative test result to enter.
i am hopeful but not optimistic that with 7 additional months of vaccinations that japan will be willing to admit vaccinated travelers. sumo tickets will probably be the only thing i would purchase without confirmation that the border is in fact open to me, but it was too good of a flight deal to turn down considering i paid $225 for flights from texas and that the fare is flexible if i can't go to japan.

the train schedule may very well change in the future as i think i already saw some discrepancy between the info on the official website (dsvn.vn) and those of the resellers or information providers (like the man in seat 61)

regards","makemytrip is a total fraud company .
we had booked tickets for trip in may'20 through them and had a tough time in trying to get money back from them.
after writing numerous emails to cc and then senior management since then as all flights were non operational due to covid, they finally returned a partial amount of the 1.20 lakh which was blocked with them in sep'20 and told that rest cannot be returned as airlines has not refunded.
i still didnt give up my fight and kept writing to them as their numbers too dont work.
finally after chasing ai too who were not processing partial money, finally i got my entire money back after chasing all high officials of airlines and mmt this month.
so guys dont spare them and do all your bits to get back your money.

and if you are the least bit serious about learning muay thai, you are better off sticking with one gym, so the trainer can build on previous instruction. switching locations/gyms interrupts any progress you are making.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g293917-i9325-k13535731-Spending_Time_in_Chiang_Mai_Muay_Thai-Chiang_Mai.html,Spending Time in Chiang Mai & Muay Thai,MrCycling 🚵‍♂️,US,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrCycling?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,50,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,200,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,50,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,50,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,27500,"[""['plenty',"", ""'muay',"", ""'thai',"", ""'gyms',"", ""'chiang',"", ""'mai',"", ""'number',"", ""'english',"", ""'speak',"", ""'trainers',"", ""'quite',"", ""'foreigners',"", ""'train',"", ""'course',"", ""'bias',"", ""'live',"", ""'10',"", ""'days',"", ""'long',"", ""'plenty',"", ""'occupy',"", ""'time',"", ""'outside',"", ""'train',"", ""'daytrip',"", ""'options',"", ""'add',"", ""'train',"", ""'trek',"", ""'cycle',"", ""'old',"", ""'city',"", ""'walk',"", ""'tour',"", ""'lot',"", ""'good',"", ""'food',"", ""'recharge',"", ""'broad',"", ""'range',"", ""'lodge',"", ""'price',"", ""'point',"", ""'least',"", ""'serious',"", ""'learn',"", ""'muay',"", ""'thai',"", ""'stick',"", ""'one',"", ""'gym',"", ""'trainer',"", ""'build',"", ""'previous',"", ""'instruction',"", ""'switch',"", ""'locations',"", ""'gyms',"", ""'interrupt',"", ""'progress']""]",True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

no, checked baggage submitted transfer desk cant terminal.

check current rule kerala,you apply kerala jagratha portal.when arrived delhi exemption request approved delhi government (same landing delhi) immigration customs allowed exit (or board flight final destination).","i had arrived delhi on 17th from overseas ,rules have changed from 22nd but why i understand other than passengers arriving from uk,eu and middle east rules are almost same. only change is that now rt pcr is compulsory to board the flight and online filling of self declaration and apply for exemption after test.
//after that do i just drop off the bags at the transfer desk / ai counter even though the next flight is several hours later?//
as per my previous experience most probably yes but after that you won't be allowed to exit,cisf won't allow to get back to arrival hall ,only way is to proceed to departure level using elevator at transfer desk.
/- i am in double mind whether to stay at holiday inn airport hotel for few hours or should i (if i am allowed to) go out and stay at the radisson. are there any pros and cons of either?/
was at t3 3 days back,after custom there is no check point,you are at arrival hall and can proceed to baggage drop or holiday inn express or any hotel outside.
considering time taken for arrival procedure and should arrive 2 hr before departure you are having around 6 he to spare,if going for outside hotel have to add time to/from hotel too.personally i think holiday express would be better and less hassle option.
/f i am able and decide to stay at an off-airport hotel, could i take one of the checked in luggage with me?/

whilst location amwaj great, it’s inclusive limited, stayed inclusive launched cost £60 ( total nights) upgrade b&b ai brainer equated £5 pp per day!
however booked several months later paid significantly opinion i’d disappointed i’d paid top money. drinks limited (no cocktails) whilst food nice choices somewhat limited.
i couldn’t complain got money day soft drinks alone unless absolute bargain again, wouldn’t opt inclusive hotel staying area.
i’ve stayed palm tree court half dozen times couple years, heard it’s got slightly restrictive recently i’ve stayed offers extensive choice restaurants food good quality, it’s town resort itself.
rixos - stayed twice, b&b short stay fine ai. prefer rooms resort ptc it’s modern opinion nicer pool area. food good don’t it’s quite good ptc choice isn’t extensive buffet decent drinks quality variety. it’s furthest hotel palm feels less far ptc .
personally i’d opt cheapest ptc rixos they’re excellent.
as riu, haven’t stayed, intend it’s 4* suspect it’ll limited food & drinks package ptc rixos.","i’ve stayed at all three of those hotels on an all inclusive basis.
whilst the location of the amwaj is great, it’s all inclusive is limited, when i stayed their all inclusive had just launched and it only cost me £60 ( that was total for 3 of us for 4 nights) to upgrade from b&b to ai so it was a no brainer as it equated to £5 pp per day!
however those who had booked several months later paid significantly more and in my opinion i’d have been very disappointed if i’d paid top money. drinks are limited (no cocktails) and whilst the food is nice your choices again are somewhat limited.
i couldn’t complain as i got my money back on the first day in soft drinks alone but unless it was an absolute bargain again, i wouldn’t opt for all inclusive in this hotel or when staying in this area.
i’ve stayed at palm tree court half a dozen times but not for a couple of years, i have heard it’s got slightly more restrictive recently however when i’ve stayed it offers the most extensive choice of restaurants and food is really good quality, it’s out of town and is a resort in itself.
rixos - stayed twice, once b&b on a short stay and another fine ai. i prefer the rooms and resort to ptc as it’s more modern and in my opinion has a nicer pool area. the food is very good but i don’t think it’s quite as good as ptc and the choice isn’t as extensive but the buffet is decent as is are the drinks quality and variety. even though it’s the furthest hotel out on the palm it feels less far out than ptc .
personally i’d opt for the cheapest between ptc and rixos as they’re both excellent.
as for riu, i haven’t stayed, nor do i intend to but it’s 4* and i suspect it’ll be more limited on the food & drinks package than ptc or rixos.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g295424-i872-k13471468-Best_All_inclusive-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html,😎 Best All inclusive 😎,hannahengland,UK,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hannahengland?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,100,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,400,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,100.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,225,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,66875,"[""['i’ve',"", ""'stay',"", ""'three',"", ""'hotels',"", ""'inclusive',"", ""'basis',"", ""'whilst',"", ""'location',"", ""'amwaj',"", ""'it’s',"", ""'inclusive',"", ""'limit',"", ""'stay',"", ""'inclusive',"", ""'launch',"", ""'cost',"", ""'£60',"", ""'total',"", ""'3',"", ""'4',"", ""'nights',"", ""'upgrade',"", ""'bb',"", ""'ai',"", ""'brainer',"", ""'equate',"", ""'£5',"", ""'pp',"", ""'per',"", ""'day',"", ""'book',"", ""'months',"", ""'pay',"", ""'significantly',"", ""'opinion',"", ""'i’d',"", ""'disappoint',"", ""'i’d',"", ""'pay',"", ""'top',"", ""'money',"", ""'drink',"", ""'limit',"", ""'cocktails',"", ""'whilst',"", ""'food',"", ""'choices',"", ""'somewhat',"", ""'limit',"", ""'couldn’t',"", ""'complain',"", ""'money',"", ""'day',"", ""'soft',"", ""'drink',"", ""'alone',"", ""'absolute',"", ""'bargain',"", ""'wouldn’t',"", ""'opt',"", ""'inclusive',"", ""'hotel',"", ""'stay',"", ""'area',"", ""'i’ve',"", ""'stay',"", ""'palm',"", ""'tree',"", ""'court',"", ""'half',"", ""'dozen',"", ""'time',"", ""'couple',"", ""'hear',"", ""'it’s',"", ""'slightly',"", ""'restrictive',"", ""'recently',"", ""'i’ve',"", ""'stay',"", ""'extensive',"", ""'choice',"", ""'restaurants',"", ""'food',"", ""'good',"", ""'quality',"", ""'it’s',"", ""'town',"", ""'resort',"", ""'rixos',"", ""'stay',"", ""'twice',"", ""'bb',"", ""'short',"", ""'stay',"", ""'fine',"", ""'ai',"", ""'prefer',"", ""'room',"", ""'resort',"", ""'ptc',"", ""'it’s',"", ""'modern',"", ""'opinion',"", ""'nicer',"", ""'pool',"", ""'area',"", ""'food',"", ""'good',"", ""'don’t',"", ""'it’s',"", ""'quite',"", ""'good',"", ""'ptc',"", ""'choice',"", ""'isn’t',"", ""'extensive',"", ""'buffet',"", ""'decent',"", ""'drink',"", ""'quality',"", ""'variety',"", ""'it’s',"", ""'furthest',"", ""'hotel',"", ""'palm',"", ""'feel',"", ""'less',"", ""'far',"", ""'ptc',"", ""'personally',"", ""'i’d',"", ""'opt',"", ""'cheapest',"", ""'ptc',"", ""'rixos',"", ""'they’re',"", ""'excellent',"", ""'riu',"", ""'haven’t',"", ""'stay',"", ""'intend',"", ""'it’s',"", ""'4',"", ""'suspect',"", ""'it’ll',"", ""'limit',"", ""'food',"", ""'drink',"", ""'package',"", ""'ptc',"", ""'rixos']""]",True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

for family vacations, and offers good value for money. it is not marketed as 5* and doesn’t claim to be on a par with 5* hotels in dubai.
in terms of the benidorm brigade, not sure they would ever choose dubai as a destination.

so interesting question, dubai want tourist?
let's start saying this. love dubai. 15 times years. quality hotels, service, amazing changes appear every year. really, love it.
so went amber, well, time start holiday hunting again.
the last time went way, ended abu dhabi flew dubai. got uk march 17th 2019, pandemic starting. previous trip, took wife's parents october 2018 stayed 10 nights palm tree court ai. palm tree court, little bit, ai hotel, hard beat opinion.
so checked much paid then. £1950 flights birmingham emirates. good deal mind. lot shopping deal , trust :-)
anyways, test, i've shopping agents tend book holidays dubai roughly holiday above, ptc, 10 days ai emirates flights. cheapest i've found far £3300 searches guarantee ultra ai package coming £3800-£4200 each!!!
now years line and, yes expo happening i'm exactly feeling love kind increase price. what's guarantee everything open hotel?
so that's question, dubai want back? i've read many times hardships hotels there's bargains i'm struggling find good deal. used example btw.
how's everyone finding this? looking forward replies guys girls. stay safe let's bargains soon.","hi everyone, hope you are all well. bit of a long one this but here goes................
so an interesting question, does dubai want us back as tourist?
let's start by saying this. i love dubai. we have been 15 times over the years. the quality of the hotels, the service, the amazing changes that appear every year. i really, really love it.
so when it went to amber, well, it was time to start the holiday hunting again.
the last time we went that way, we ended up in abu dhabi but flew out to dubai. we actually got back into the uk on march 17th 2019, just as the pandemic was starting. previous to that trip, we took my wife's parents in october 2018 and stayed 10 nights in palm tree court on ai. i do like palm tree court, i know it's out a little bit, but as an ai hotel, it's hard to beat in my opinion.
so i checked up how much we paid back then. it was £1950 each with flights out of birmingham on emirates. a good deal in my mind. and i do a lot of shopping around to get such a deal , trust me :-)
anyways, as a test, i've been shopping around the agents i tend to use when i book our holidays to dubai for roughly the same holiday as above, ptc, 10 days ai with emirates flights. the cheapest i've found it so far is £3300 each and some searches that guarantee the ultra ai package are coming back as £3800-£4200 each!!!
now i know we are a few years down the line and, yes expo is happening etc but i'm not exactly feeling the love here for this kind of increase in price. and what's the guarantee when we get there everything will be open in the hotel?
so that's my question, does dubai want us back? i've read so many times of the hardships of the hotels over there etc and how there's bargains to be had but i'm really struggling to find a good deal. i used the above as just an example btw.
how's everyone else finding this? looking forward to your replies guys and girls. stay safe and let's hope for some bargains soon.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g295424-i872-k13640983-Does_Dubai_Want_Us_Back-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html,Does Dubai Want Us Back?,pickleh,UK,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pickleh?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,800,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,200,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,90000,"[""['long',"", ""'one',"", ""'interest',"", ""'question',"", ""'dubai',"", ""'tourist',"", ""'start',"", ""'dubai',"", ""'15',"", ""'time',"", ""'quality',"", ""'hotels',"", ""'service',"", ""'amaze',"", ""'appear',"", ""'amber',"", ""'time',"", ""'start',"", ""'holiday',"", ""'hunt',"", ""'time',"", ""'way',"", ""'end',"", ""'abu',"", ""'dhabi',"", ""'fly',"", ""'dubai',"", ""'uk',"", ""'march',"", ""'17th',"", ""'2019',"", ""'pandemic',"", ""'start',"", ""'previous',"", ""'trip',"", ""'wifes',"", ""'parent',"", ""'october',"", ""'2018',"", ""'stay',"", ""'10',"", ""'nights',"", ""'palm',"", ""'tree',"", ""'court',"", ""'ai',"", ""'palm',"", ""'tree',"", ""'court',"", ""'little',"", ""'ai',"", ""'hotel',"", ""'hard',"", ""'beat',"", ""'opinion',"", ""'much',"", ""'pay',"", ""'£1950',"", ""'flight',"", ""'birmingham',"", ""'emirates',"", ""'good',"", ""'deal',"", ""'mind',"", ""'lot',"", ""'shop',"", ""'deal',"", ""'trust',"", ""'anyways',"", ""'test',"", ""'shop',"", ""'agents',"", ""'tend',"", ""'book',"", ""'holiday',"", ""'dubai',"", ""'roughly',"", ""'holiday',"", ""'ptc',"", ""'10',"", ""'days',"", ""'ai',"", ""'emirates',"", ""'flight',"", ""'cheapest',"", ""'far',"", ""'£3300',"", ""'search',"", ""'guarantee',"", ""'ultra',"", ""'ai',"", ""'package',"", ""'£3800',"", ""'£4200',"", ""'line',"", ""'expo',"", ""'happen',"", ""'exactly',"", ""'feel',"", ""'kind',"", ""'increase',"", ""'price',"", ""'guarantee',"", ""'open',"", ""'hotel',"", ""'question',"", ""'dubai',"", ""'read',"", ""'many',"", ""'time',"", ""'hardships',"", ""'hotels',"", ""'bargain',"", ""'struggle',"", ""'good',"", ""'deal',"", ""'example',"", ""'btw',"", ""'hows',"", ""'reply',"", ""'guy',"", ""'girls',"", ""'stay',"", ""'safe',"", ""'bargain',"", ""'soon']""]",True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

shout if you need some contacts - not sure of the scene at the moment (post covid) but it might be start.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g295424-i872-k13546190-Charter_Boat-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html,Charter Boat,Sean R,UK,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/275seanr?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,100,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,100,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,100,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,30000,"[""['couple',"", ""'company',"", ""'private',"", ""'charter',"", ""'group',"", ""'cruise',"", ""'swim',"", ""'music',"", ""'beers',"", ""'food',"", ""'sunset…',"", ""'pick',"", ""'company',"", ""'lot',"", ""'book',"", ""'agents',"", ""'pass',"", ""'owners',"", ""'clear',"", ""'indication',"", ""'process',"", ""'day',"", ""'passengers',"", ""'harbour',"", ""'master',"", ""'shout',"", ""'contact',"", ""'scene',"", ""'moment',"", ""'post',"", ""'covid',"", ""'start']""]",True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

however, it seems rixos the palm is on hotelscom and is listed as 'all-inclusive', so it definitely should be able to send that booking to pruvo, providing it's a free-cancellation or refundable rather than advance purchase.
screenshot >>>

also, checking on trivago it's also listing as 'all-inclusive across a few other websites, so again, it should be able to sent.
two points to make though..
1) obviously, it depends on how reputable the alternative sites where the other deals are found, eg one on trivago was zen hotels which isn't as popular as expedia, hotelscom etc. when i use pruvo, i don't always take every reduced booking offered as i try to minimise how many different sites i use to book - it saves newsletters, setting up new accounts etc.
2) the only downside to the ai aspect is - as if often the case - you'd likely be at the mercy of the hotel and their operations about what may be included on the deal if it's not clearly specified at the time of booking. then again, i've saved some walloping amounts of money on pruvo so with the savings, you could always do another mmi or a&e run for champers!",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g295424-i872-k13507048-Advice_for_potential_family_visit_in_October-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html,Advice for potential family visit in October,Shaun C,US,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shaunclark99?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,400,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,100,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,400,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,225,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,101875,"[""['chrissie',"", ""'devil',"", ""'detail',"", ""'eg',"", ""'site',"", ""'originally',"", ""'book',"", ""'clarity',"", ""'amount',"", ""'restaurants',"", ""'comparable',"", ""'sadly',"", ""'hb',"", ""'ai',"", ""'far',"", ""'consistent',"", ""'platforms',"", ""'hotels',"", ""'providers',"", ""'potential',"", ""'deal',"", ""'limit',"", ""'bb',"", ""'room',"", ""'pick',"", ""'widely',"", ""'room',"", ""'type',"", ""'rixos',"", ""'palm',"", ""'hotelscom',"", ""'inclusive',"", ""'able',"", ""'send',"", ""'book',"", ""'pruvo',"", ""'provide',"", ""'free',"", ""'cancellation',"", ""'refundable',"", ""'advance',"", ""'purchase',"", ""'screenshot',"", ""'trivago',"", ""'inclusive',"", ""'websites',"", ""'able',"", ""'send',"", ""'two',"", ""'point',"", ""'1',"", ""'obviously',"", ""'reputable',"", ""'alternative',"", ""'sit',"", ""'deal',"", ""'eg',"", ""'one',"", ""'trivago',"", ""'zen',"", ""'hotels',"", ""'isnt',"", ""'popular',"", ""'expedia',"", ""'hotelscom',"", ""'pruvo',"", ""'reduce',"", ""'book',"", ""'try',"", ""'minimise',"", ""'many',"", ""'different',"", ""'sit',"", ""'book',"", ""'save',"", ""'newsletters',"", ""'set',"", ""'new',"", ""'account',"", ""'2',"", ""'downside',"", ""'ai',"", ""'aspect',"", ""'case',"", ""'youd',"", ""'mercy',"", ""'hotel',"", ""'operations',"", ""'may',"", ""'include',"", ""'deal',"", ""'clearly',"", ""'specify',"", ""'time',"", ""'book',"", ""'save',"", ""'wallop',"", ""'amount',"", ""'money',"", ""'pruvo',"", ""'save',"", ""'mmi',"", ""'ae',"", ""'run',"", ""'champers']""]",True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

realise ai has it's drawbacks but as we will be mainly spending time with family it fits the bill. as rixos is only ai, i think, hopefully it should work on pruvo.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g295424-i872-k13507048-Advice_for_potential_family_visit_in_October-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html,Advice for potential family visit in October,Chrissie,EU,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chrissieLancashire?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,400,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,40000,"[""['shaun',"", ""'flexible',"", ""'book',"", ""'october',"", ""'reschedule',"", ""'time',"", ""'march',"", ""'extend',"", ""'trip',"", ""'add',"", ""'hotel',"", ""'mix',"", ""'may',"", ""'pruvo',"", ""'try',"", ""'realise',"", ""'ai',"", ""'drawbacks',"", ""'mainly',"", ""'spend',"", ""'time',"", ""'family',"", ""'fit',"", ""'bill',"", ""'rixos',"", ""'ai',"", ""'work',"", ""'pruvo']""]",True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

i agree with the assessment above. as per an economist's, 2.4trillion yen for the 1year delaying tactics, yet the range in estimated loss gets more than double (5.1trillion) if the event ever gets called off for good. so probably there's no way of cancelling it.

obviously, that also assume japan will bring the cases down around that time. bear in mind that japan has not begun any vaccination program (please correct me if i am wrong), so japan will have some catch up to do.
you do have my sympathy as your money is stuck with the cruise lines and the airlines. i don't know at what price point will you not be able to afford the airfare to japan. personally i feel that i should be able to get a roundtrip ticket to japan this september for less than $1,200. it may not a direct flight, but it will get me there and back.

first never travel agent/package, never ai spend weeks (or mins) nusa dua.
much depends budget.
how long stay.
has decision driven you’ve seen travel brochure done research.
best chose bali honeymoon. interests personally.
nusa dua
nusa dua isn’t bali. could anywhere world warm lots hotels sea. mostly manufactured hotel resort area. nusa dua large area include tanjung benoa area. mostly hotel hotel often little nothing outside except service road hotel. hotels isolated.
nusa dua often pushed uk tour operators.
all inclusive
recommendations often ai. going nusa dua stay right area easily good local restaurants.
don’t assume choose ai based “alcohol consumption” ai cocktails made named brand spirits. likely local “brands”.
sightseeing
if want sightseeing/activities consider splitting hotels (depending interests).
bali big island 5000sqkm certain sights activities best done certain areas.
on bali driving slow going. don’t expect average 30kmh longer distances away congested south. purely example nusa dua ubud 40km. easily 1h30 day. best waterfalls bali north. 100km straight drive easily 3h30 stops.
we amed diving, snorkeling/chillaxing transfer directly landing. barely 90km/60miles invariably takes 3hrs.
split
you want consider ubud. good place start holiday/honeymoon. good base sightseeing activities (e.g. whitewater rafting cycle tours countryside).
just examples hotels close town interest you.




there many many many including private villas.
booking
if choose uk tour operator aware offered narrow choice hotels narrow choice locations.
seen uk companies offering choice hotels “in” ubud (there hundreds hotels), outside town.
it important check exact location hotel carefully. believe hotel description, brochure bumf name. true ubud find “ubud” hotels 20km town.

covid travel aside
first to say most of us on here never use a travel agent/package, would never go ai or spend 2 weeks (or for some 2 mins) in nusa dua.
much depends on your budget.
how long will you stay.
has your decision been driven by what you’ve seen in a travel brochure or have you done some research.
best if you say why you chose bali for your honeymoon. what interests you personally.
nusa dua
nusa dua isn’t bali. you could be anywhere in the world really that is warm has lots of hotels and has a sea. it is mostly a manufactured hotel resort area. nusa dua is a large area and can also include the tanjung benoa area. mostly hotel after hotel with often little to nothing outside except a service road and another hotel. some hotels can be isolated.
nusa dua often pushed by uk tour operators.
all inclusive
recommendations often to not to go ai. even going to nusa dua if you stay in the right area you can easily get to some good local restaurants.
don’t assume if you choose ai based on “alcohol consumption” that your ai cocktails will be made with named brand spirits. just as likely to be local “brands”.
sightseeing
if you want to do some sightseeing/activities consider splitting between 2 or more hotels (depending on your interests).
bali is a big island of over 5000sqkm and certain sights and activities are best done from certain areas.
on bali driving is slow going. don’t expect to average more than 30kmh even on longer distances away from the congested south. purely as an example nusa dua to ubud is 40km. this will easily take 1h30 during the day. the best waterfalls in bali are in the north. it is 100km straight drive and will easily take 3h30 without stops.
we go to amed for diving, snorkeling/chillaxing and always transfer directly on landing. it is barely 90km/60miles but invariably takes us 3hrs.
split
you might want to consider ubud. good place to start your holiday/honeymoon. good base for both sightseeing and activities (e.g. whitewater rafting or cycle tours through the countryside).
just some examples of hotels close to town that might interest you.




there are many many many more including private villas.
booking
if you choose a uk tour operator be aware you will be offered a very very very narrow choice of hotels in a very very very narrow choice of locations.
seen uk companies offering only a choice of 5 hotels “in” ubud (there are hundreds of hotels), 4 of which were outside town.
it is also important you check exact location of any hotel carefully. do not believe hotel description, brochure bumf or even name. this is especially true for ubud where you can find “ubud” hotels over 20km from town.

you advised travel times bali. nusa dua long way interesting see. example, wanted do/see anything ubud, allow 3-4 hours car back. means missing meals paid hotel. well sitting car travelling roads travelled.
most people bali stay area two weeks, many visit 2-3 parts bali, experience island fully.
you reconsider hiring car exploring. driving bali feint hearted. roads narrow, signposted traffic horrendous. driver car arrange day trips. cost 600,000 idr per car, per person discuss driver want see. however, book hotel nd, expect pay whole lot this. beware set ""tours"" often charge per person.
can whole lot research, decide want honeymoon. bali much offer, shame see there. could start reading areas bali, link below. also, computer (not phone) read top questions bali, right hand side bali forum front page

you have also been advised about travel times in bali. and nusa dua is a long way from most of the interesting things to do and see. as an example, if you wanted to do/see anything around ubud, then allow 3-4 hours in the car to get there and back. that means you'll be missing the meals you have paid for back at your hotel. as well as sitting in a car travelling the same roads you have already travelled.
most people who go to bali do not stay in one area for two weeks, many visit 2-3 parts of bali, to experience the island more fully.
you also may like to reconsider hiring a car to go off exploring. driving in bali is not for the feint hearted. roads are narrow, not signposted and traffic is more than horrendous. most of us do use a driver with car and arrange our day trips. cost is around 600,000 idr per car, not per person and you can discuss with your driver the things you want to see. however, if you book at your hotel in nd, then expect to pay a whole lot more than this. also do beware of set ""tours"" which often charge per person.
can i suggest that you do a whole lot more research, and decide what you really want from your honeymoon. bali has so very much to offer, that it would be a shame not to see any of it while you were there. you could start by reading about the areas of bali, link below. also, on a computer (not phone) read the top questions about bali, right hand side of the bali forum front page
whatever you decide, i hope you have a wonderful honeymoon.

i literally know nothing about ad at this point just thought it might be a nice change of scenery for a few days.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g295424-i872-k13645174-Split_stay_advice_Abu_Dhabi_Dubai-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html,Split stay advice Abu Dhabi - Dubai,clawit,UK,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/clawit?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,50,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,50,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,200,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,50,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,27500,"[""['shaun',"", ""'beach',"", ""'large',"", ""'pool',"", ""'hb',"", ""'minimum',"", ""'6',"", ""'overwhelm',"", ""'food',"", ""'cost',"", ""'add',"", ""'it’s',"", ""'premium',"", ""'time',"", ""'xmas',"", ""'transfer',"", ""'dubai',"", ""'xmas',"", ""'children',"", ""'must',"", ""'separate',"", ""'room',"", ""'minimum',"", ""'2',"", ""'bed',"", ""'suite',"", ""'pay',"", ""'extra',"", ""'room',"", ""'3',"", ""'bed',"", ""'suite',"", ""'palace',"", ""'beautiful',"", ""'near',"", ""'budget',"", ""'i’ve',"", ""'rixos',"", ""'include',"", ""'ai',"", ""'it’s',"", ""'3',"", ""'days',"", ""'good',"", ""'hotel',"", ""'literally',"", ""'ad',"", ""'point',"", ""'scenery',"", ""'days']""]",True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

actually, as we so often get questions from people who just want to go to bath, bourton on the water and the isle of skye, it’s quite refreshing to see one which combines the otherwise oddly disparate destinations you’ve raised.
have you considered buying open jaw air tickets, maybe arriving in scotland and leaving from london? if you did this you could construct a zigzag trip going glasgow, aberystwyth, norwich, heathrow, which, according to a bing map search would, direct, be 729 miles in total. in british terms this is a lot of driving but in three weeks, and as it for a specific purpose rather than random sightseeing, it would be entirely possible. as all of these places have railway stations, you could do the trip by train, with several changes on the way, but a car would give you flexibility and you could take in some interesting sights en route without lengthening your driving overmuch. for instance, close to the direct route from glasgow to aberystwyth there are two wonderful national parks (the lake district and snowdonia) and you could stop over for two or three nights in either or both of these. there’s also the fine city of liverpool of course, and, for a contrast, the roman/medieval cathedral city of chester. standard advice here is not to do lots of one-night-stands but to pace your journey and get to know fewer places well rather than more places superficially.
aberystwyth to norwich is far from being a ‘standard’ tourist trip but you could explore the welsh borders en route – consider the fine old town of ludlow as a stopover. lichfield is a delightful cathedral city, off the well-trodden tourist track, and cambridge wouldn’t be a very big detour. norwich itself is a great small city and one which tends to be unjustly missed by overseas visitors purely because of its geography.
all this is obviously exceptionally covid-dependent and i think you realise that the chances of it being possible safely and legally this season are less than evens. bear in mind too that late july and august are high season touristically and i suspect more british people will tend to be holidaying, if at all, within britain rather than overseas. finally, a website called university rooms offers

thanks","hello
covid permitting (i’m fully aware how closed vietnam is atm) we are thinking about a family holiday to vietnam this summer. unfortunately we’re tied to uk school holidays so july/august is really our only option. on that basis we realise we may be best limiting our visit to the south and central regions..
currently thinking along the lines of:
fly into hcmc from singapore.
2-3 nights to settle in inc a day trip to the tunnels
1 night cruise on mekong delta.
1 night back in hcmc before travelling on to somewhere central for a week on or near a beach. possibly hoi an and da nang as we could then fly from danang back to singapore but travel agent also suggested mui ne.
we basically want somewhere we can chill out and walk or taxi to good local food. happy to stay in a 4-5 star hotel but won’t be dining there!
thoughts really appreciated!

also this website for public transport planning:

after a boat trip, i would just enjoy balloch country park which gives lovely views of the loch and with lots of room for the children to run around.
the train journey - that is a lot of travelling time.if it's a lovely day then you might be as well only going as far as corrour station, the remotest in the uk.gorgeous area.you can walk down to loch ossian on a good track, have time at the loch in lovely scenery and visit the good bistro for something to eat (or take a picnic.) the scenery on the first portion of the train trip to corrour and fort william, to be, beats what you see on the fw mallaig portion (good though that is too.)

made numerous calls and emails to check on the status of my bookings but their answer was always the same, “checking with merchant”.
had been monitoring the price at dream cruises website and noticed that prices are increasing by days. got more worried.
finally, after a whole episode of waiting (more than 48 hours than they claim on their website) and without any definite answer, they replied my email only to find out “regarding your enquiry of [klook exclusive] 2nights/3nights getaway cruise by dream cruises - jqn519918 & uje542321 & maj744727, upon checking, unfortunately, we regret to inform you that we are unable to confirm these bookings due to there is a pricing issue. therefore, we will assist you to cancel and full refund on these bookings.”

please also be mindful that their email reply was only after 24 hours so no point indicating that your query is urgent or asking for immediate response. if you are lucky to find their hotline number, they won't bother to return your calls albeit numerous messages and requests for a follow up call. this is going to be my first and last time ever to book with them. my advice – book with them only if you plan to screw up your own booking.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g294262-i1747-k13496011-KLOOK_Untrusted_and_Unreliable-Singapore.html,KLOOK - Untrusted and Unreliable,NHYA13,0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NHYA13?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,100,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,100,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,400,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,50000,"[""['book',"", ""'fully',"", ""'pay',"", ""'s1256',"", ""'genting',"", ""'dream',"", ""'cruise',"", ""'package',"", ""'6',"", ""'pax',"", ""'2',"", ""'cabin',"", ""'9',"", ""'jun',"", ""'upon',"", ""'book',"", ""'completion',"", ""'app',"", ""'show',"", ""'“this',"", ""'activity',"", ""'confirm',"", ""'48',"", ""'hours”',"", ""'worry',"", ""'assume',"", ""'instantaneous',"", ""'cruise',"", ""'book',"", ""'platforms',"", ""'plus',"", ""'indication',"", ""'“live”',"", ""'book',"", ""'numerous',"", ""'call',"", ""'email',"", ""'status',"", ""'book',"", ""'“checking',"", ""'merchant”',"", ""'monitor',"", ""'price',"", ""'dream',"", ""'cruise',"", ""'website',"", ""'notice',"", ""'price',"", ""'increase',"", ""'days',"", ""'worry',"", ""'finally',"", ""'whole',"", ""'episode',"", ""'wait',"", ""'48',"", ""'hours',"", ""'claim',"", ""'website',"", ""'definite',"", ""'reply',"", ""'email',"", ""'“regarding',"", ""'enquiry',"", ""'klook',"", ""'exclusive',"", ""'2nights',"", ""'3nights',"", ""'getaway',"", ""'cruise',"", ""'dream',"", ""'cruise',"", ""'jqn519918',"", ""'uje542321',"", ""'maj744727',"", ""'upon',"", ""'unfortunately',"", ""'regret',"", ""'inform',"", ""'unable',"", ""'confirm',"", ""'book',"", ""'due',"", ""'price',"", ""'therefore',"", ""'assist',"", ""'cancel',"", ""'full',"", ""'refund',"", ""'bookings”',"", ""'“…note',"", ""'payment',"", ""'credit',"", ""'card',"", ""'bank',"", ""'generally',"", ""'10',"", ""'business',"", ""'days',"", ""'process',"", ""'transfer',"", ""'fund',"", ""'account',"", ""'bank',"", ""'15',"", ""'30',"", ""'days',"", ""'bill',"", ""'cycle”',"", ""'eff',"", ""'mad',"", ""'speechless',"", ""'book',"", ""'platform',"", ""'indicate',"", ""'instantaneous',"", ""'hold',"", ""'money',"", ""'query',"", ""'promptly',"", ""'negative',"", ""'outcome',"", ""'compensation',"", ""'wait',"", ""'long',"", ""'money',"", ""'top',"", ""'price',"", ""'guarantee',"", ""'uncommitted',"", ""'mindful',"", ""'email',"", ""'reply',"", ""'24',"", ""'hours',"", ""'point',"", ""'indicate',"", ""'query',"", ""'urgent',"", ""'immediate',"", ""'response',"", ""'lucky',"", ""'hotline',"", ""'number',"", ""'bother',"", ""'call',"", ""'albeit',"", ""'numerous',"", ""'message',"", ""'request',"", ""'call',"", ""'time',"", ""'ever',"", ""'book',"", ""'advice',"", ""'book',"", ""'plan',"", ""'screw',"", ""'book']""]",True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

i am spending one month in thailand, for the third time next year, and will just see a small part of it. and spending a month in bali.

do possible contract local car driver tawang entire trip guwahati guwahati? or, allowed carry travellers guwahati? way, bumla-madhuri day, pay double cars. time, madhuri lake, day itself, reach zemithang via different mountain route must seen. so, elucidate.

edited: 5:38 pm, june 08,","hi! i went through your whole post. i really liked it, especially the way you chose to spend one extra day at dirang to cover up some bomdila sightseeing. although i believe the cost was too much. maybe it had to do with the fact that you went with an operator, stayed at premium hotels, had special non-veg foods, alcohols, dividing bumla-sungetser lake in 2 days, 2 safaris etc. arunachal, of this circuit, has been on my bucket list since summer 2020, and i still don't know when it will be fulfilled courtesy of the coronavirus pandemic.
i am writing this to address a couple of suggestions as to how i think within the said number of days, the tour could have been better as well as to make a couple of inquiries for adding some information to my research.
suggestions:
i believe, since you bunch were tourists who didn't mind waking up as early as 5-5:50 am, had you done that regularly, there were a few spots you could have added to your itinerary, such as manda la (a high-pass at an hour journey from dirang, and locals call 3 sisters mandala, sela, bumla in the region), bomdila war memorial and viewpoint (in bomdila), kalachakra gompa (in dirang), taktsang gompa (4 km from madhuri lake and you had time) etc.
if you were doing both elephant and jeep safaris at kaziranga, you should have opted to do them from 2 different gates, whereas i presume that you have done both from kohora central range. there are 3 other ranges, and agoratoli eastern range might have been better for your jeep safari.
you could have mentioned in your story that you entered arunachal pradesh from guwahati via kalaktang and returned via bhalukpong. i was confused.
queries:
i knew that only local tawang sumos are allowed in the bumla-sungetser route, as you said north of tawang. i can also see in your story that for local tawang sightseeing, such as monastery, war memorial, buddha statue etc., that local sumo is though not needed. however, my question is about zemithang. can one not take his car from guwahati to zemithang via lumla route? you went there with the local sumo but said tourists were rare. so, is there really any place where anyone checks whether you are in a local sumo or not? as far i know, one can go to zemithang in his other car also. so, please clarify.
do you know if it is possible to make a contract with a local car or driver of tawang only for the entire trip of guwahati to guwahati? or, are they not allowed to carry travellers from guwahati? by that way, for bumla-madhuri day, one doesn't have to pay for double cars. at the same time, after madhuri lake, on that day itself, one can reach zemithang via a different mountain route you must have seen. so, please elucidate.
nevertheless, you had a great tour, and thank you for writing such a prolonged story regarding your tour, mentioning manifold points. it helps a lot to detail enthusiastic planners like me, to know about the timings to and fro particular places, food prices, tricks they apply to fool tourists, non-availability of non-veg on wednesdays, non-allowance of mobiles in bumla and many other details. from what i understand from your story is that road conditions have improved in several places. let's see whether my plan with around 6 travellers gets fulfilled during this puja vacation or next year or when.

yes and no,, depending on what you want to get out of your vacation.
1st, muay thai gyms exist in practically every city in thailand, and your hotel could arrange muay thai workouts at your hotel if you request it.
no, 10 days is too long for chiang mai and any other single destination in thailand for a first-time visitor to thailand, chiang mai is not centrally-located, and does not offer a well-rounded thailand travel experience.
yes, 10 days is adequate if you want to earn a ph.d. in chiang mai. as michaelb stated above, chiang mai provides a good base for exploring the surrounding cities that he mentioned above, especially exploring chiang rai in the north.

3. if chiang mai is your desired destination, where is your gateway airport . . . chiang mai, bangkok, or phuket? difference in air cost between the gateways?",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g293917-i9325-k13535731-Spending_Time_in_Chiang_Mai_Muay_Thai-Chiang_Mai.html,Spending Time in Chiang Mai & Muay Thai,CharlesR,US,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VacationerCritic?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,200,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,200,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,40000,"[""['1',"", ""'muay',"", ""'thai',"", ""'drive',"", ""'trip',"", ""'thailand',"", ""'switch',"", ""'gyms',"", ""'locations',"", ""'irrelevant',"", ""'person',"", ""'muay',"", ""'thai',"", ""'learn',"", ""'kata',"", ""'pattern',"", ""'form',"", ""'martial',"", ""'arts',"", ""'work',"", ""'one',"", ""'teacher',"", ""'trainer',"", ""'help',"", ""'progress',"", ""'2',"", ""'chiang',"", ""'mai',"", ""'place',"", ""'explore',"", ""'possibly',"", ""'relocate',"", ""'primary',"", ""'thailand',"", ""'destination',"", ""'trip',"", ""'3',"", ""'chiang',"", ""'mai',"", ""'desire',"", ""'destination',"", ""'gateway',"", ""'airport',"", ""'chiang',"", ""'mai',"", ""'bangkok',"", ""'phuket',"", ""'difference',"", ""'air',"", ""'cost',"", ""'gateways']""]",True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

edited: 1:45 am, january 25,","i feel that you are being a bit ambitious to cover so many places in 10 days. the way that your travel is set up you end up travelling between cities and that takes up most of the daylight hours. out of the 10 days, you are travelling for 4 days. also during these times, train and bus schedules are disrupted.
as nikhil suggests, a road journey could optimise your schedule, whereas train travel could optimise your budget. unfortunately train options and timings are very restrictive now. as you note jaipur-jaisalmer trains only run in the day. similarly jaipur to udaipur trains run mainly in the day and not on all days of the week.
in my view, cut out bikaner and do the circuit the other way, i.e. jaipur-udaipur-jodhpur-jaisalmer. the reason for this is that temple timings at ranakpur means that when starting from jodhpur, you reach kumbhalgarh only in the evening, necessitating an overnight stay there. but doing it the other way (from udaipur to jodhpur) means that you can cover kumbhalgarh and ranakpur on the same day.

recently, on some of my trips i notice at least they push the sanitizer on folks standing in line, make them wear masks and even request the guests put on disposable gloves when entering the line. but, staff served food will always be more hygienic, not 100% but better than selfservice.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g295424-i872-k13637371-Buffet_breakfast_offerings-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html,Buffet breakfast offerings,AA,MX,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SKOOBDO?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,50,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,50,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,200,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,25000,"[""['fasttrack',"", ""'self',"", ""'service',"", ""'buffet',"", ""'away',"", ""'good',"", ""'include',"", ""'cruise',"", ""'ship',"", ""'theyve',"", ""'hygienic',"", ""'recently',"", ""'trip',"", ""'notice',"", ""'least',"", ""'push',"", ""'sanitizer',"", ""'folks',"", ""'stand',"", ""'line',"", ""'wear',"", ""'mask',"", ""'request',"", ""'guests',"", ""'disposable',"", ""'gloves',"", ""'enter',"", ""'line',"", ""'staff',"", ""'serve',"", ""'food',"", ""'hygienic',"", ""'100',"", ""'selfservice']""]",True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

i hope all these places help you get a clear picture for some good memories. as you are currently in dubai, i would like to know if at this point of time you were able to get a visa to dubai. i heard that travelling is suspended for now due to the pandemic. please revert, it will be highly appreciated.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g295424-i872-k13476758-Burj_Al_arab_view-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html,Burj Al arab view,Shakuntala Jat,UK,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shakuntalajat?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,134,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,300,0,0,0,300,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,68978,"[""['aside',"", ""'burj',"", ""'khalifa',"", ""'burj',"", ""'al',"", ""'arab',"", ""'one',"", ""'must',"", ""'see',"", ""'tourist',"", ""'attractions',"", ""'dubai',"", ""'tall',"", ""'burj',"", ""'khalifa',"", ""'burj',"", ""'al',"", ""'arab',"", ""'title',"", ""'third',"", ""'tallest',"", ""'hotel',"", ""'world',"", ""'translate',"", ""'“tower',"", ""'arabs',"", ""'english”',"", ""'build',"", ""'distinct',"", ""'design',"", ""'charm',"", ""'captivate',"", ""'visitor',"", ""'dubai',"", ""'per',"", ""'question',"", ""'three',"", ""'place',"", ""'perfect',"", ""'view',"", ""'burj',"", ""'al',"", ""'arab',"", ""'hotel',"", ""'dubai',"", ""'sunset',"", ""'beach',"", ""'one',"", ""'pleasant',"", ""'surprise',"", ""'encounter',"", ""'visit',"", ""'dubai',"", ""'beautiful',"", ""'beach',"", ""'one',"", ""'ever',"", ""'middle',"", ""'eastern',"", ""'city',"", ""'coast',"", ""'sunset',"", ""'beach',"", ""'sit',"", ""'coast',"", ""'burj',"", ""'al',"", ""'arab',"", ""'jumeirah',"", ""'fact',"", ""'closest',"", ""'beach',"", ""'highly',"", ""'exclusive',"", ""'hotel',"", ""'madniat',"", ""'jumeirah',"", ""'closer',"", ""'burj',"", ""'al',"", ""'arab',"", ""'sip',"", ""'coffee',"", ""'meal',"", ""'al',"", ""'fresco',"", ""'style',"", ""'head',"", ""'madinat',"", ""'jumeirah',"", ""'sea',"", ""'cruise',"", ""'cruise',"", ""'one',"", ""'main',"", ""'dubai',"", ""'cruise',"", ""'start',"", ""'dubai',"", ""'marina',"", ""'passengers',"", ""'choice',"", ""'day',"", ""'night',"", ""'boat',"", ""'travel',"", ""'cruise',"", ""'awesome',"", ""'view',"", ""'burj',"", ""'al',"", ""'arab',"", ""'place',"", ""'help',"", ""'clear',"", ""'picture',"", ""'good',"", ""'memories',"", ""'dubai',"", ""'point',"", ""'time',"", ""'able',"", ""'visa',"", ""'dubai',"", ""'hear',"", ""'travel',"", ""'suspend',"", ""'due',"", ""'pandemic',"", ""'revert',"", ""'highly']""]",True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

as left hk jan 2020, i, many others sure, become obsessed day able travel. day seems shrunk ever distance, focus dwindled basically trip day possible given current circumstances personal situation: saturday day night sunday afternoon macau, friends. small male group 30s willing spend lots money (though much macau standards i’m sure$$$), current plan:
* early saturday ferry
* time, check casino mgm macau
* taxi taipa, eat old portuguese places, santos, manel petisqueira
* drinks old taipa tavern
* check-in galaxy hotel, suite
* grand deck resort
* drinks macallan bar, galaxy
* buffet free flow urban kitchen, jw marriott (in galaxy complex)
* merrily check new londoner casino drink st. regis bar
* merrily finish night duffy’s roadhouse near broadway hotel, within galaxy resort
* pool sunday face it
*check hanami ramen wynn palace battle hangover
* head home
in idealised version macau possible, bars restaurants missed out? anything new about? (not macau 19, sadly.) thinking wrong? base macau side bother taipa/cotai? so, why?
i mix least little portuguese side casino side mates love ramen plus it’s mostly brits londoner sounds fun. picked galaxy amazing pool facilities plus proximity broadway bar/food street old taipa tavern.
i love hear feedback ideas! thanks advance reading far 🤣","(i realise that this is so far from being possible that i am essentially indulging in counter factual history but anyway, if anyone wants to play then your comments would be appreciated!)
as i have not left hk since jan 2020, i, like many others i am sure, have become obsessed with the day when we will once again be able to travel. as that day seems to have shrunk ever further into the distance, my own focus has now dwindled to basically one trip that might one day be possible given the current circumstances and my own personal situation: a saturday day and night and sunday afternoon in macau, with my friends. i would be with a small all male group in our 30s and probably willing to spend lots of money (though not that much by macau standards i’m sure$$$), and this is my current plan:
* early saturday ferry
* if we have time, check out the casino at the mgm macau
* taxi to taipa, eat at one of the old portuguese places, maybe o santos, o manel or petisqueira
* drinks at old taipa tavern
* check-in to galaxy hotel, maybe a suite
* grand deck resort
* drinks at macallan bar, galaxy
* buffet and free flow at urban kitchen, jw marriott (in galaxy complex)
* merrily check out the new londoner casino and drink at the st. regis bar
* very merrily finish the night at duffy’s and roadhouse near broadway hotel, within the galaxy resort
* use the pool on sunday if anyone can face it
*check out and go to hanami ramen in wynn palace to battle the hangover
* head home
in an idealised version of macau where this would be possible, are there any or better bars or restaurants which i have missed out? anything new i do not know about? (not been to macau since may 19, sadly.) or am i thinking about this all wrong? should we base ourselves on the macau side and not bother with taipa/cotai? if so, why?
i would like to mix at least a little of the portuguese side of things with the casino side and most of my mates love ramen plus it’s mostly brits so the londoner sounds fun. i have picked galaxy so we can use their amazing pool facilities plus its proximity to the broadway bar/food street and old taipa tavern.
i would love to hear some feedback or other ideas! thanks in advance for reading this far 🤣",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g664891-i12409-k13640389-Anyone_care_to_humour_me-Macau.html,Anyone care to humour me?,TheOExpress🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿🇭🇰,HK,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheOExpress?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,300,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,134,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,300,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,68978,"[""['realise',"", ""'far',"", ""'essentially',"", ""'indulge',"", ""'counter',"", ""'factual',"", ""'history',"", ""'play',"", ""'comment',"", ""'hk',"", ""'jan',"", ""'2020',"", ""'many',"", ""'others',"", ""'become',"", ""'obsess',"", ""'day',"", ""'able',"", ""'travel',"", ""'day',"", ""'shrink',"", ""'ever',"", ""'distance',"", ""'focus',"", ""'dwindle',"", ""'basically',"", ""'one',"", ""'trip',"", ""'one',"", ""'day',"", ""'current',"", ""'circumstances',"", ""'personal',"", ""'situation',"", ""'saturday',"", ""'day',"", ""'night',"", ""'sunday',"", ""'afternoon',"", ""'macau',"", ""'friends',"", ""'small',"", ""'male',"", ""'group',"", ""'30s',"", ""'spend',"", ""'lot',"", ""'money',"", ""'much',"", ""'macau',"", ""'standards',"", ""'i’m',"", ""'current',"", ""'plan',"", ""'early',"", ""'saturday',"", ""'ferry',"", ""'time',"", ""'casino',"", ""'mgm',"", ""'macau',"", ""'taxi',"", ""'taipa',"", ""'eat',"", ""'one',"", ""'old',"", ""'portuguese',"", ""'place',"", ""'santos',"", ""'manel',"", ""'petisqueira',"", ""'drink',"", ""'old',"", ""'taipa',"", ""'tavern',"", ""'galaxy',"", ""'hotel',"", ""'suite',"", ""'grand',"", ""'deck',"", ""'resort',"", ""'drink',"", ""'macallan',"", ""'bar',"", ""'galaxy',"", ""'buffet',"", ""'free',"", ""'flow',"", ""'urban',"", ""'kitchen',"", ""'jw',"", ""'marriott',"", ""'galaxy',"", ""'complex',"", ""'merrily',"", ""'new',"", ""'londoner',"", ""'casino',"", ""'drink',"", ""'st',"", ""'regis',"", ""'bar',"", ""'merrily',"", ""'finish',"", ""'night',"", ""'duffy’s',"", ""'roadhouse',"", ""'near',"", ""'broadway',"", ""'hotel',"", ""'galaxy',"", ""'resort',"", ""'pool',"", ""'sunday',"", ""'face',"", ""'hanami',"", ""'ramen',"", ""'wynn',"", ""'palace',"", ""'battle',"", ""'hangover',"", ""'head',"", ""'home',"", ""'idealise',"", ""'version',"", ""'macau',"", ""'bar',"", ""'restaurants',"", ""'miss',"", ""'new',"", ""'macau',"", ""'may',"", ""'19',"", ""'sadly',"", ""'wrong',"", ""'base',"", ""'macau',"", ""'side',"", ""'bother',"", ""'taipa',"", ""'cotai',"", ""'mix',"", ""'least',"", ""'little',"", ""'portuguese',"", ""'side',"", ""'casino',"", ""'side',"", ""'mat',"", ""'ramen',"", ""'plus',"", ""'it’s',"", ""'mostly',"", ""'brits',"", ""'londoner',"", ""'sound',"", ""'fun',"", ""'pick',"", ""'galaxy',"", ""'amaze',"", ""'pool',"", ""'facilities',"", ""'plus',"", ""'proximity',"", ""'broadway',"", ""'bar',"", ""'food',"", ""'street',"", ""'old',"", ""'taipa',"", ""'tavern',"", ""'hear',"", ""'feedback',"", ""'ideas',"", ""'advance',"", ""'read',"", ""'far',"", ""'🤣']""]",True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

i think we were just unlucky but if i ever go on a cruise and it stops there , i'm staying on lol .",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g295424-i872-k13483303-Extra_nights_at_burj_or_business_class_on_flight-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html,extra nights at burj or business class on flight,maggiemaggie56,UK,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/maggiemaggie56?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,300,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,30000,"[""['lovedogs1234',"", ""'saw',"", ""'program',"", ""'day',"", ""'trip',"", ""'st',"", ""'lucia',"", ""'cruise',"", ""'ship',"", ""'stop',"", ""'beautiful',"", ""'island',"", ""'mountains',"", ""'small',"", ""'bus',"", ""'20',"", ""'stop',"", ""'many',"", ""'time',"", ""'people',"", ""'buy',"", ""'felt',"", ""'pressurise',"", ""'buy',"", ""'island',"", ""'man',"", ""'jump',"", ""'bus',"", ""'obvs',"", ""'something',"", ""'wave',"", ""'arm',"", ""'shout',"", ""'someones',"", ""'wife',"", ""'owe',"", ""'money',"", ""'pick',"", ""'one',"", ""'guy',"", ""'wife',"", ""'owe',"", ""'money',"", ""'guy',"", ""'wife',"", ""'terrify',"", ""'happen',"", ""'stall',"", ""'holder',"", ""'hadnt',"", ""'calm',"", ""'choice',"", ""'word',"", ""'wait',"", ""'ship',"", ""'much',"", ""'beach',"", ""'lovedogs',"", ""'unlucky',"", ""'ever',"", ""'cruise',"", ""'stop',"", ""'stay']""]",True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

i think i would be holding fire until it opens and working out a plan once a few punters have been through and there is more of an idea of what's on offer.
i would suggest allowing 3 days of your stay for the visit and then planning other stuff around it and tweaking the tin a little later. book a hotel at that end of the city to minimise travel (the metro line runs out to the site). if you run out of stuff to do you could hit one of the other emirates for a few nights (abu dhabi if all back to normal) or even have a look at popping to oman for a few nights.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g295424-i872-k13619063-Expo_Dubai_Itinerary-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html,Expo Dubai Itinerary,Sean R,UK,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/275seanr?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,100,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,100,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,100,100,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,40000,"[""['single',"", ""'day',"", ""'ticket',"", ""'website',"", ""'time',"", ""'see',"", ""'people',"", ""'dash',"", ""'tower',"", ""'london',"", ""'2',"", ""'hours',"", ""'others',"", ""'spend',"", ""'age',"", ""'interest',"", ""'level',"", ""'guess',"", ""'hold',"", ""'fire',"", ""'open',"", ""'work',"", ""'plan',"", ""'punters',"", ""'idea',"", ""'allow',"", ""'3',"", ""'days',"", ""'stay',"", ""'visit',"", ""'plan',"", ""'stuff',"", ""'tweak',"", ""'tin',"", ""'little',"", ""'book',"", ""'hotel',"", ""'end',"", ""'city',"", ""'minimise',"", ""'travel',"", ""'metro',"", ""'line',"", ""'run',"", ""'site',"", ""'run',"", ""'stuff',"", ""'hit',"", ""'one',"", ""'emirates',"", ""'nights',"", ""'abu',"", ""'dhabi',"", ""'normal',"", ""'pop',"", ""'oman',"", ""'nights']""]",True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

perhaps i’m paranoid! anyway i’ve stayed at the oberoi and found it to be fabulous in terms of service. the staff really went the extra mile however there was a recent forum user who felt they received mediocre service on a recent visit, perhaps they were just unlucky or perhaps it’s a sign of the times with cut backs etc.
the hotel is quite business orientated and it can be argued that the hotels around business bay are a bit sterile with not much going on but a like for like hotel closer to downtown or the marina would be considerably more.
on my own personal experience ( which was pre-pandemic) i’d be happy to go back to the oberoi and thought it was superior to the marriott marquis despite having a much better room category at the marriott.
the taj is also very nice and the staff are lovely, it has a more attractive pool area as well.

day 1 .took 24 hour pcr test in orlando, flew on delta to jfk and then on to dubai. orlando didnt ask to see the pcr test but did show it upon check in with emirates at jfk. flight was packed every seat was taken. when we arrived in dubai i was stunned how fast and easy it was to deplane. just before customs, they were checking for neg pcr tests, showed the employee it and she lets us through without any questions. noone asked to see it after that. i was very surprised the customs guy when i asked if he wanted it, just waved us through.
took the metro from term 3 to mashreq metro stop.i purchased the gold card since i was concerned about physical distancing on the train. no issues at all the whole trip with the metro. less then 40 min later it was a 5 min walk to the hampton, check in was flawless and room was nice.it was small and didnt have alot of drawer space but it was a great location and staff was amazing (definitley will stay there again). that concludes day 1 and technically day 2 of the trip.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g295424-i872-k13486848-Usa_to_dubai_trip_report_2_10_2_19-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html,usa to dubai-trip report 2/10-2/19,Fran P,US,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/756franp?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,100,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,100,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,100,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,100,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,100,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,50000,"[""['sorry',"", ""'delay',"", ""'busier',"", ""'expect',"", ""'backnot',"", ""'post',"", ""'trip',"", ""'forum',"", ""'day',"", ""'1',"", ""'24',"", ""'hour',"", ""'pcr',"", ""'test',"", ""'orlando',"", ""'fly',"", ""'delta',"", ""'jfk',"", ""'dubai',"", ""'orlando',"", ""'see',"", ""'pcr',"", ""'test',"", ""'show',"", ""'upon',"", ""'emirates',"", ""'jfk',"", ""'flight',"", ""'pack',"", ""'seat',"", ""'arrive',"", ""'dubai',"", ""'stun',"", ""'fast',"", ""'easy',"", ""'deplane',"", ""'customs',"", ""'neg',"", ""'pcr',"", ""'test',"", ""'show',"", ""'employee',"", ""'question',"", ""'noone',"", ""'see',"", ""'surprise',"", ""'customs',"", ""'guy',"", ""'wave',"", ""'metro',"", ""'term',"", ""'3',"", ""'mashreq',"", ""'metro',"", ""'stopi',"", ""'purchase',"", ""'gold',"", ""'card',"", ""'concern',"", ""'physical',"", ""'distance',"", ""'train',"", ""'whole',"", ""'trip',"", ""'metro',"", ""'less',"", ""'40',"", ""'min',"", ""'5',"", ""'min',"", ""'walk',"", ""'hampton',"", ""'flawless',"", ""'room',"", ""'niceit',"", ""'small',"", ""'alot',"", ""'drawer',"", ""'space',"", ""'location',"", ""'staff',"", ""'amaze',"", ""'definitley',"", ""'stay',"", ""'conclude',"", ""'day',"", ""'1',"", ""'technically',"", ""'day',"", ""'2',"", ""'trip']""]",True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

is there such a think as a small good villa for two on or very near the beach - probably near a food shop so i don't need to go far - or need a car. thanks appreciate any suggestions x",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g295424-i872-k13486923-Unusual_request_quiet_beach_experience-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html,Unusual request - quiet beach experience?,marcie5,UK,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marcie5?tab=forum,0,0,100,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,100,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,100,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,100,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,100,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,400,0,0,0,100,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,70000,"[""['arrive',"", ""'dubai',"", ""'november',"", ""'via',"", ""'cruise',"", ""'ship',"", ""'18',"", ""'days',"", ""'total',"", ""'luxury',"", ""'small',"", ""'cruise',"", ""'ship',"", ""'eat',"", ""'drink',"", ""'sight',"", ""'see',"", ""'style',"", ""'disembark',"", ""'dubai',"", ""'days',"", ""'chill',"", ""'beach',"", ""'simple',"", ""'pleasures',"", ""'walk',"", ""'beach',"", ""'eat',"", ""'light',"", ""'food',"", ""'base',"", ""'ideal',"", ""'catch',"", ""'ray',"", ""'head',"", ""'uk',"", ""'winter',"", ""'visit',"", ""'dubai',"", ""'couple',"", ""'time',"", ""'exist',"", ""'fabulous',"", ""'hotels',"", ""'amaze',"", ""'shop',"", ""'fancy',"", ""'time',"", ""'small',"", ""'good',"", ""'villa',"", ""'two',"", ""'near',"", ""'beach',"", ""'near',"", ""'food',"", ""'shop',"", ""'far',"", ""'car',"", ""'suggestions']""]",True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

i had written off dubai for expo 2020, but now i'm possibly thinking about going again, but in 2022, and ""maybe"" things might be better then regarding covid worldwide. but, if i go i'll end up staying probably 2 months. last time was 3 months, but i just took several cruises to extend my stay.
this time i'll need to go back to the airport or to the immigration office. is that the same procedure. i know they have an app, but i think it's for residents only. i tried using it once, back in 2020 and it didn't work for me.

if you want to know if uber is still there just go to your uber app and put in a origination and destination point anywhere in dubai and see if it shows cars around.
i've been to so many countries and have dealt with so many taxis that i generally stay away from them. but, if you ever have a suspicion with a taxi driver take a photo of their license plate and car number. i've never had any problems with ride-sharing apps (yet). :)

family inn fiftys has locations near disney and universal studios. check their reviews on tripadvisor. i've stayed at the one in osaka, but not the one near disney. expect small basic rooms, cheaper than the official disney hotel.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g294232-i525-k13491478-Land_cruise_theme_parks-Japan.html,Land/ cruise/ theme parks,Bargainhunter,US,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bargainhunter?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,300,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,300,0,0,0,134,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,68978,"[""['cruise',"", ""'japan',"", ""'country',"", ""'cruise',"", ""'stop',"", ""'port',"", ""'japan',"", ""'cruise',"", ""'generally',"", ""'cheap',"", ""'travel',"", ""'cruise',"", ""'port',"", ""'convenient',"", ""'place',"", ""'tourists',"", ""'tourists',"", ""'japanese',"", ""'train',"", ""'system',"", ""'easily',"", ""'place',"", ""'see',"", ""'rail',"", ""'pass',"", ""'itinerary',"", ""'good',"", ""'deal',"", ""'overnight',"", ""'bus',"", ""'willer',"", ""'bus',"", ""'cheap',"", ""'tire',"", ""'sleep',"", ""'bus',"", ""'price',"", ""'conscious',"", ""'stick',"", ""'train',"", ""'system',"", ""'family',"", ""'inn',"", ""'fiftys',"", ""'locations',"", ""'near',"", ""'disney',"", ""'universal',"", ""'studios',"", ""'tripadvisor',"", ""'stay',"", ""'one',"", ""'osaka',"", ""'one',"", ""'near',"", ""'disney',"", ""'expect',"", ""'small',"", ""'basic',"", ""'room',"", ""'cheaper',"", ""'official',"", ""'disney',"", ""'hotel']""]",True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

the question about whether the cruise ship will allow you to stay abroad should be answered by the cruise line. i am not sure there is a universal answer.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g294232-i525-k13542458-Norwegian_Cruise_into_Tokyo-Japan.html,Norwegian Cruise-into Tokyo,edofva,US,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/edofva?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,200,0,0,0,50,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,22500,"[""['aside',"", ""'question',"", ""'whether',"", ""'allow',"", ""'japan',"", ""'time',"", ""'reason',"", ""'able',"", ""'hotel',"", ""'early',"", ""'room',"", ""'ready',"", ""'allow',"", ""'early',"", ""'luggage',"", ""'explore',"", ""'city',"", ""'interest',"", ""'stay',"", ""'ship',"", ""'question',"", ""'whether',"", ""'cruise',"", ""'ship',"", ""'allow',"", ""'stay',"", ""'abroad',"", ""'cruise',"", ""'line',"", ""'universal']""]",True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

hfot2","greetings supriya thanawala,
it is always nice to talk to someone from india. we traveled there on and off for 15 years, spending more than a year overall in the country.
as far as your plans for your visit to japan, and south korea and taiwan with just 12-13 days allotted to japan, you need to rethink your plan and pare it down rather than add more cities.
you say “i want to cover south korea, japan, and taiwan all in detail.” we have visited japan more than 20 times for 6 weeks at a time and we will never in our lifetime be able to say that we have “covered” it in detail.
yes the trains are fast, but you still don't want to spend your entire time in japan on them.
plot out your priority places and potential route and look at hyperdia:  to see how long each train trip is.
a great resource, if you haven't found it already, is 
you can start here for destinations:

another issue is that i drive the opposite seat and direction of that used in uk. for me it is very dangerous to drive in uk and high probability to accident. with children i cannot go on public transport all over uk. so cruise is my best shot or to skip uk completely. in other countries i usually drive a car but in uk it is too risky for someone used to the oppoiste.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g186485-i107-k13516964-Visit_on_october-Scotland.html,visit on october,michel d,IS,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/micheld774?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,400,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,40000,"[""['input',"", ""'guess',"", ""'cruise',"", ""'may',"", ""'august',"", ""'large',"", ""'ship',"", ""'cruise',"", ""'3000',"", ""'passenger',"", ""'1000',"", ""'crew',"", ""'amsterdam',"", ""'norway',"", ""'fjords',"", ""'kind',"", ""'large',"", ""'wave',"", ""'something',"", ""'many',"", ""'people',"", ""'sick',"", ""'break',"", ""'something',"", ""'park',"", ""'something',"", ""'special',"", ""'britain',"", ""'aware',"", ""'drive',"", ""'opposite',"", ""'seat',"", ""'direction',"", ""'uk',"", ""'dangerous',"", ""'drive',"", ""'uk',"", ""'high',"", ""'probability',"", ""'accident',"", ""'children',"", ""'cannot',"", ""'public',"", ""'transport',"", ""'uk',"", ""'cruise',"", ""'shoot',"", ""'skip',"", ""'uk',"", ""'completely',"", ""'countries',"", ""'drive',"", ""'car',"", ""'uk',"", ""'risky',"", ""'oppoiste']""]",True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

at a time when these pages were rife with reports of travel companies and accommodation operators withholding deposits, refusing refunds etc they simply handed back the deposit which i didn’t expect tbh . i simply rang them to say that i wouldn’t be going and to let someone have the car. without asking deposit pinged back there and then .

i do like to stay in one location for a few days, so try to avoid one night stands on road trips if possible :-) . last time we were in scotland we stayed in edinburgh for 3 days/3 nights i believe. i am wondering if it would work to stay in glasgow for something like 3 or 4 nights and maybe do a day trip via train to stirling one day and maybe go back to edinburgh another day? not sure on edinburgh, but we did enjoy. it. i think the university of edinburgh doesn't have the creative writing courses that strathclyde does, though. we may also look at the university of glasgow, too, but strathclyde is tops for her right now.
i threw nui galway in ireland into the mix because we have really good friends who are both professors (their oldest daughter is a year younger than my uni-bound one) and they love galway, having taught there on exchanges. my daughter is a bit intimidated by trying to figure out the irish university application system as well as the uk system, but i thought while we are in on that side of the atlantic maybe we could check it out, plus our friends might be able to make some suggestions and introductions. and we also have another old friend who lives in dublin. i know adding ireland does make it a bit more complex. we might be able to fly into dublin or out of it to help with the logistics.",0,0,0,0,UK,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,100,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,100,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,100,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,100,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,100,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,100,100.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,70000,"[""['indeed',"", ""'trip',"", ""'place',"", ""'uea',"", ""'creative',"", ""'write',"", ""'course',"", ""'strathclyde',"", ""'overall',"", ""'uni',"", ""'stem',"", ""'orient',"", ""'aberystwyth',"", ""'quite',"", ""'research',"", ""'three',"", ""'worth',"", ""'investigate',"", ""'person',"", ""'norwich',"", ""'good',"", ""'mark',"", ""'engage',"", ""'small',"", ""'city',"", ""'read',"", ""'google',"", ""'streetview',"", ""'armchair',"", ""'tour',"", ""'stay',"", ""'one',"", ""'location',"", ""'days',"", ""'try',"", ""'avoid',"", ""'one',"", ""'night',"", ""'stand',"", ""'road',"", ""'trip',"", ""'time',"", ""'scotland',"", ""'stay',"", ""'edinburgh',"", ""'3',"", ""'days',"", ""'3',"", ""'nights',"", ""'wonder',"", ""'work',"", ""'stay',"", ""'glasgow',"", ""'something',"", ""'3',"", ""'4',"", ""'nights',"", ""'day',"", ""'trip',"", ""'via',"", ""'train',"", ""'stirling',"", ""'one',"", ""'day',"", ""'edinburgh',"", ""'day',"", ""'edinburgh',"", ""'university',"", ""'edinburgh',"", ""'creative',"", ""'write',"", ""'course',"", ""'strathclyde',"", ""'may',"", ""'university',"", ""'glasgow',"", ""'strathclyde',"", ""'top',"", ""'right',"", ""'throw',"", ""'nui',"", ""'galway',"", ""'ireland',"", ""'mix',"", ""'good',"", ""'friends',"", ""'professors',"", ""'oldest',"", ""'daughter',"", ""'younger',"", ""'uni',"", ""'bind',"", ""'one',"", ""'galway',"", ""'teach',"", ""'exchange',"", ""'daughter',"", ""'intimidate',"", ""'try',"", ""'figure',"", ""'irish',"", ""'university',"", ""'application',"", ""'system',"", ""'uk',"", ""'system',"", ""'side',"", ""'atlantic',"", ""'plus',"", ""'friends',"", ""'able',"", ""'suggestions',"", ""'introductions',"", ""'old',"", ""'friend',"", ""'live',"", ""'dublin',"", ""'add',"", ""'ireland',"", ""'complex',"", ""'able',"", ""'fly',"", ""'dublin',"", ""'help',"", ""'logistics']""]",True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

last month i drove from se london to just north of perth. we left at 4:30 am and had lunch at teabay services, which is close enough to being the lake district in distance terms. we got to our destination at 15:30. i know the route (no satnav) and we were in a car so apart from coffee / food breaks and driver changes we didn’t hang about and had no traffic snarl ups.
we came home from yorkshire (roughly yarm / sw middlesbrough) and the traffic was dreadful on the a1,
driving a camper van would be slower and frankly if you haven’t got past birmingham before breakfast going north you need to add a lot more time to the trip. coming back there’s probably nothing you can do to avoid heavy traffic.
overall it will probably be gruelling driving for far too much of the time i think.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g186216-i15-k13573885-Scotland_Road_trip_starting_from_london-United_Kingdom.html,Scotland Road trip starting from london,Mark E,US,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mark_Elliott?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,50,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,200,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,50,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,50,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,50,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,30000,"[""['there’s',"", ""'much',"", ""'drive',"", ""'slow',"", ""'vehicle',"", ""'wonder',"", ""'you’ve',"", ""'factor',"", ""'early',"", ""'start',"", ""'you’ll',"", ""'month',"", ""'drive',"", ""'se',"", ""'london',"", ""'north',"", ""'perth',"", ""'430',"", ""'lunch',"", ""'teabay',"", ""'service',"", ""'close',"", ""'lake',"", ""'district',"", ""'distance',"", ""'term',"", ""'destination',"", ""'1530',"", ""'route',"", ""'satnav',"", ""'car',"", ""'apart',"", ""'coffee',"", ""'food',"", ""'break',"", ""'driver',"", ""'didn’t',"", ""'hang',"", ""'traffic',"", ""'snarl',"", ""'home',"", ""'yorkshire',"", ""'roughly',"", ""'yarm',"", ""'sw',"", ""'middlesbrough',"", ""'traffic',"", ""'dreadful',"", ""'a1',"", ""'drive',"", ""'camper',"", ""'van',"", ""'slower',"", ""'frankly',"", ""'haven’t',"", ""'past',"", ""'birmingham',"", ""'breakfast',"", ""'north',"", ""'add',"", ""'lot',"", ""'time',"", ""'trip',"", ""'there’s',"", ""'avoid',"", ""'heavy',"", ""'traffic',"", ""'overall',"", ""'gruelling',"", ""'drive',"", ""'far',"", ""'much',"", ""'time']""]",True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

","i would say 2 days in edinburgh unless you plan say, a day's tour of the highlands. something like this will take you through some great west highland scenery:

however not necessarily rabbies - there are other operators too though tours tend to be whistlestop so might not suit your need for a slower pace.
the glasgow to fw train journey gives you several very good options for breaking the journey for a day or so to enjoy some beautiful places:
for example, you could stop and overnight around tarbert on loch lomond, a tiny place but where there is an excellent boat trip on the loch to inversnaid.eating out though is limited and arrochar next door would be your best bet, using a taxi. otherwise, staying somewhere like pretty luss village also on the loch, would be another great option (no train station .potentially taxi from a nearby station if that can be arranged.local hotels might help with that.)
then resume your train journey north with another potential stop at corrour - most remote station in uk, gorgeous environment, great bistro right at the station, excellent accommodation too and the chance to do flattish walks by loch ossian.

then resume journey to fort william.the scenery to fw is stunning.
you can certainly carry on to mallaig too - not a lot in mallaig , a down to earth wee fishing/ferry port, but i personally like it for a short time, with great views to skye too (which you could potentially go over too also - magnificent island.bus to portree or stay in south skye around isle ornsay perhaps (eilean iarmain hotel is in a gorgeous spot.)

use this to evaluate on high level.

apart from the national jr passes, consider also regional passes which might suit better in your case, e.g. the 5-day jr west kansai hiroshima pass (khp) is ideal for a round trip visit to hiroshima from osaka/kyoto.

prepaid ic card - this would be essential for long stay to pay for daily commutes on city subways and commuter trains in japan. use this to commute to nearby cities like kyoto, nara, kobe etc from osaka. same applies to yokohama, kamakura/enoshima etc from tokyo.
note that jr pass does not cover any city subways in japan.
check out local business hotel chains for budget travellers as mentioned.
airbnb - japan is very strict to rules so beware to stay in legally registered properties only or else you run the risk of being evicted by police - search for past comments on this forum. besides, rates are not much cheaper than in compatible hotels. look for locations close to subway/train stations would be a big plus.

any thoughts or suggestions would be appreciated thank you",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g294232-i525-k13580089-Flight_from_Toronto_to_Osaka_vs_Toronto_to_Tokyo-Japan.html,Flight from Toronto to Osaka vs Toronto to Tokyo.,Wendy L,Richmond Hill...,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Grey-Roamer?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,400,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,100,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,45000,"[""['cruise',"", ""'tokyo',"", ""'may',"", ""'direct',"", ""'flight',"", ""'osaka',"", ""'suggestion',"", ""'stop',"", ""'pacific',"", ""'side',"", ""'vancouver',"", ""'san',"", ""'francisco',"", ""'end',"", ""'vancouver',"", ""'may',"", ""'search',"", ""'exist',"", ""'hong',"", ""'kong',"", ""'taipei',"", ""'close',"", ""'tourisim',"", ""'require',"", ""'visa',"", ""'longer',"", ""'flight',"", ""'toronto',"", ""'right',"", ""'difficult',"", ""'search',"", ""'airlines',"", ""'may',"", ""'start',"", ""'osaka',"", ""'day',"", ""'trip',"", ""'week',"", ""'cruise',"", ""'end',"", ""'tokyo',"", ""'fo',"", ""'days',"", ""'bullet',"", ""'train',"", ""'send',"", ""'luggage',"", ""'ship',"", ""'land',"", ""'osaka',"", ""'travel',"", ""'lighter',"", ""'thoughts',"", ""'suggestions']""]",True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

the 7-day national jr pass should more than payoff if you activate on d5 and return to tokyo on d11, ie. before it expires.
use this calculator to evaluate on high level. a round trip to nasu shiobara by the tohoku shinkansen roughly costs over jpy10k.

tokyo 72-hour subway ticket roughly payoff if you could ride at least 3 to 4 rides daily. however, it does not cover the yurikamome monorail to odaiba. thus, buy a prepaid suica / pasmo card for daily commutes on subways and commuter trains in japan.
b. for opening date/time, search on japan-guide.com or the temple/shrine websites directly.
c. on clear days in hakone, mt fuji can be viewed along the ropeway, on the lake cruise closer to the lake rim along hakonemachi.

i normally don't like to judge how people run their lives. however, if you are worried about a child's behavior on trains, wouldn't you be more worried about how the little one might cope inside a plane cabin for hours? riding a train for short trips seems to be a small problem.
my suggestion is you take the train between osaka and kyoto. once you get to kyoto, you can either hire a taxi from mk as suggested for the day. alternatively, you can just mix taxi and train/subway rides as you see fit. taxis are almost always standing by at popular attractions and transport hubs.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g298566-i2803-k13471040-Kyoto_Day_Trip_with_Toddler_Car_service-Osaka_Osaka_Prefecture_Kinki.html,Kyoto Day Trip with Toddler - Car service?,SammyFD,HK,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SammyFD?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,100,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,100,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,100,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,30000,"[""['sanity',"", ""'op',"", ""'try',"", ""'keep',"", ""'3',"", ""'yo',"", ""'control',"", ""'apparently',"", ""'worry',"", ""'3',"", ""'yo',"", ""'sit',"", ""'public',"", ""'transport',"", ""'normally',"", ""'judge',"", ""'people',"", ""'run',"", ""'live',"", ""'worry',"", ""'childs',"", ""'behavior',"", ""'train',"", ""'worry',"", ""'little',"", ""'one',"", ""'cope',"", ""'inside',"", ""'plane',"", ""'cabin',"", ""'hours',"", ""'rid',"", ""'train',"", ""'short',"", ""'trip',"", ""'small',"", ""'problem',"", ""'suggestion',"", ""'train',"", ""'osaka',"", ""'kyoto',"", ""'kyoto',"", ""'hire',"", ""'taxi',"", ""'mk',"", ""'day',"", ""'alternatively',"", ""'mix',"", ""'taxi',"", ""'train',"", ""'subway',"", ""'rid',"", ""'see',"", ""'fit',"", ""'taxis',"", ""'stand',"", ""'popular',"", ""'attractions',"", ""'transport',"", ""'hubs']""]",True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

when we did the trip from mai chau to ninh binh we had planned to spend 3 days in mai chau as we loved it when we first stayed the 15-20 years ago. it had changed a lot. the two homestays that were there back then had multiplied to something like 50. to get the authentic experience you seek, i would suggest getting way out into the valley away from the main settlements. ninh binh needs 3 nights to see the main sights, take a few boat trips etc. . both mc and nb get very busy with domestic tourists especially at weekends so time your visits mid week if possible.
in between the two locations we spent one night at each of three small villages. these one night stays were about right as we were mainly hiking (and part driving) between each. on a motorbike with a guide i can imagine it would be a great experience .

as for traveling by train, it is my preferred option in vietnam. not the most comfortable but ok i would recommend going for a soft sleeper berth (bottom bunk if you can). my understanding is that the schedules have been dramatically curtailed, when they will return to normal. two benefits of train travel; they are usually overnight and you save on a nights accommodation. most live late evening and arrive early morning effectively allowing a full day at either end.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g293921-i8432-k13495331-April_Itinerary-Vietnam.html,April Itinerary,crellston,UK,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/crellston?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,200,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,50,50.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,25000,"[""['whilst',"", ""'advocate',"", ""'spend',"", ""'3',"", ""'nights',"", ""'place',"", ""'basis',"", ""'allow',"", ""'two',"", ""'full',"", ""'days',"", ""'see',"", ""'stuff',"", ""'occasion',"", ""'road',"", ""'trip',"", ""'quite',"", ""'happy',"", ""'move',"", ""'day',"", ""'journey',"", ""'reward',"", ""'destinations',"", ""'motorcycle',"", ""'drive',"", ""'trip',"", ""'stop',"", ""'place',"", ""'way',"", ""'trip',"", ""'mai',"", ""'chau',"", ""'ninh',"", ""'binh',"", ""'plan',"", ""'spend',"", ""'3',"", ""'days',"", ""'mai',"", ""'chau',"", ""'stay',"", ""'15',"", ""'20',"", ""'lot',"", ""'two',"", ""'homestays',"", ""'multiply',"", ""'something',"", ""'50',"", ""'authentic',"", ""'experience',"", ""'seek',"", ""'way',"", ""'valley',"", ""'away',"", ""'main',"", ""'settlements',"", ""'ninh',"", ""'binh',"", ""'3',"", ""'nights',"", ""'see',"", ""'main',"", ""'sight',"", ""'boat',"", ""'trip',"", ""'mc',"", ""'nb',"", ""'busy',"", ""'domestic',"", ""'tourists',"", ""'weekend',"", ""'time',"", ""'visit',"", ""'mid',"", ""'week',"", ""'two',"", ""'locations',"", ""'spend',"", ""'one',"", ""'night',"", ""'three',"", ""'small',"", ""'villages',"", ""'one',"", ""'night',"", ""'stay',"", ""'right',"", ""'mainly',"", ""'hike',"", ""'part',"", ""'drive',"", ""'motorbike',"", ""'guide',"", ""'imagine',"", ""'experience',"", ""'add',"", ""'extra',"", ""'days',"", ""'cave',"", ""'phong',"", ""'nha',"", ""'ke',"", ""'worth',"", ""'tif',"", ""'add',"", ""'three',"", ""'nights',"", ""'en',"", ""'route',"", ""'hue',"", ""'ninh',"", ""'binh',"", ""'trainquite',"", ""'lot',"", ""'teh',"", ""'area',"", ""'cave',"", ""'amaze',"", ""'travel',"", ""'train',"", ""'prefer',"", ""'vietnam',"", ""'comfortable',"", ""'recommend',"", ""'soft',"", ""'sleeper',"", ""'berth',"", ""'bottom',"", ""'bunk',"", ""'schedule',"", ""'dramatically',"", ""'curtail',"", ""'normal',"", ""'two',"", ""'benefit',"", ""'train',"", ""'travel',"", ""'overnight',"", ""'save',"", ""'nights',"", ""'accommodation',"", ""'live',"", ""'late',"", ""'arrive',"", ""'early',"", ""'morning',"", ""'effectively',"", ""'allow',"", ""'full',"", ""'day',"", ""'end']""]",True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

yes, sound usually road, means driving lot, mostly freedom unmatched train travel, stop anytime need to.
anyways, decide much time spend mai chau/ninh binh, travel places. motorbike seems preferred option, i'll see alone accompanied.
i thought phong nha caves, feel that's must needs, i'm sure photo opportunities are, put itinerary.
yeah, reckon planning trains services right much sense, timetables change situation does.
i'll see.
thank","thanks for the info.
yes, that does sound great and i usually really like being on the road, even if it means driving a lot, mostly because that freedom is unmatched by train travel, and you can stop anytime you need to.
anyways, i still have to decide how much time to spend in mai chau/ninh binh, and how to travel between the places. motorbike seems the preferred option, but i'll see if alone of accompanied.
i have thought about the phong nha caves, but i don't feel like that's a must for my needs, and since i'm not sure what photo opportunities there are, i didn't put it in the itinerary.
yeah, i reckon planning the trains and other services right now doesn't make much sense, as the timetables will change when the situation does.

beautiful scenery and certainly beautiful people can be found in the unexpected places, particularly if they are not used to a steady stream of tourists. some of our best times in vietnam have been with local people in places we had no intention of stopping at. if i am correct, you buy the train tickets for each part of the journey so you can be very flexible, especially where there are plenty of trains to choose from.
a great source of info is travelfish. stuart writes about many places most of us have never heard of, and also offers good advice about the well known spots.
having said all of this, the most well known places are well known for a reason and offer great opportunities for all of the interests you have listed. the longer you take, the better the experience will be. and if you don’t get a feel for somewhere, the best thing is you can hop onto a train.

i have tried the usual uk operators, emerald, viking etc, but i can't help feeling that i can do better. does anyone who has a similar disability have real experience of such a trip who can offer some advice on this, or knows of an agent who subcontracts holidays from these operators who can make a better job of it?",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g293921-i8432-k13642293-Vietnam_and_Mekong_with_a_disability-Vietnam.html,Vietnam and Mekong with a disability,Peter L,US,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PeterLanky?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,100,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,100,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,100,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,100,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,100,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,100,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,60000,"[""['unspecified',"", ""'time',"", ""'future',"", ""'holiday',"", ""'vietnam',"", ""'cambodia',"", ""'include',"", ""'reasonable',"", ""'6',"", ""'7',"", ""'day',"", ""'mekong',"", ""'cruise',"", ""'total',"", ""'length',"", ""'3',"", ""'weeks',"", ""'disable',"", ""'spinal',"", ""'cord',"", ""'injury',"", ""'wheelchair',"", ""'100',"", ""'dependent',"", ""'stand',"", ""'assistance',"", ""'age',"", ""'mid',"", ""'60s',"", ""'mind',"", ""'completely',"", ""'manage',"", ""'trip',"", ""'include',"", ""'flight',"", ""'arrangements',"", ""'piecemeal',"", ""'much',"", ""'trip',"", ""'incorporate',"", ""'overall',"", ""'price',"", ""'pay',"", ""'drink',"", ""'gratuities',"", ""'day',"", ""'excursions',"", ""'try',"", ""'cheap',"", ""'try',"", ""'usual',"", ""'uk',"", ""'operators',"", ""'emerald',"", ""'viking',"", ""'help',"", ""'feel',"", ""'similar',"", ""'disability',"", ""'real',"", ""'experience',"", ""'trip',"", ""'advice',"", ""'agent',"", ""'subcontract',"", ""'holiday',"", ""'operators',"", ""'job']""]",True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

most optimistic scenario:
vn would have 70% of the population vaccinated by year end if all the promised doses arrive on time.
they're working on being able to put a million doses in arms per day.
at 50%, the us is already ready to move on with life. there are so many flyers, the airlines are having a hard time dealing with it.
car rental rates are sky high, if you're lucky enough to get one.

as for the language barriers, that was a large part of why we chose to go with a guide. being able to communicate in the various dialects improved the experience immeasurably. we have had some amazing experiences over the years in these remote villages. the people are extremely hospitable and we have been invited to join numerous parties and celebrations over the years that we would almost have certainly missed out on on our own. ninh binh and mai chau will definitely have electricity, most of the smaller villages will have generators but will turn them off at night. take your own water to any remote places along with plenty of mozzie repellent.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g293921-i8432-k13494675-Two_different_itineraries_for_April_and_September-Vietnam.html,Two different itineraries for April and September,crellston,UK,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/crellston?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,100,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,100,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,100,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,30000,"[""['something',"", ""'quite',"", ""'similar',"", ""'one',"", ""'trip',"", ""'vietnam',"", ""'hire',"", ""'car',"", ""'driver',"", ""'incorporate',"", ""'lot',"", ""'hike',"", ""'villages',"", ""'mai',"", ""'chau',"", ""'ninh',"", ""'binh',"", ""'via',"", ""'black',"", ""'river',"", ""'pu',"", ""'long',"", ""'allocate',"", ""'time',"", ""'section',"", ""'possibly',"", ""'skip',"", ""'da',"", ""'nang',"", ""'efficient',"", ""'time',"", ""'train',"", ""'ninh',"", ""'binh',"", ""'travel',"", ""'mai',"", ""'chau',"", ""'opposite',"", ""'direction',"", ""'hanoi',"", ""'chau',"", ""'detail',"", ""'lot',"", ""'photos',"", ""'trip',"", ""'blog',"", ""'post',"", ""'scroll',"", ""'third',"", ""'fourth',"", ""'post',"", ""'bottomthere',"", ""'stuff',"", ""'hanoi',"", ""'hue',"", ""'language',"", ""'barriers',"", ""'large',"", ""'part',"", ""'guide',"", ""'able',"", ""'communicate',"", ""'various',"", ""'dialects',"", ""'improve',"", ""'experience',"", ""'immeasurably',"", ""'amaze',"", ""'experience',"", ""'remote',"", ""'villages',"", ""'people',"", ""'extremely',"", ""'hospitable',"", ""'invite',"", ""'join',"", ""'numerous',"", ""'party',"", ""'celebrations',"", ""'miss',"", ""'ninh',"", ""'binh',"", ""'mai',"", ""'chau',"", ""'electricity',"", ""'smaller',"", ""'villages',"", ""'generators',"", ""'turn',"", ""'night',"", ""'water',"", ""'remote',"", ""'place',"", ""'plenty',"", ""'mozzie',"", ""'repellent']""]",True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

about can tho (and the mekong delta in general), yeah, if you're already down there, it would be a shame not to spend a little more time there.
i'm thinking you may want to steal a day in saigon and depart for rạch giá early.
that way, you can spend christmas eve in rạch giá, after the island.
then spend 2 nights in can tho at a homestay like green village mekong or nguyen shack before the cruise.
in fact, you could spend 3 nights there, including one night in town, if you preferred (for the night market and the ninh kieu wharf). in order to do that, you need to take away another night in saigon at the end.
or perhaps, see how you like hòn sơn island; you can always cut short the stay there.

4. going hiroshima/miyajima. unique fly hiroshima haneda fly kansai.
what options alternate suggestions? obviously, everything dependent covid year, plan next year! :)
thank you!","hello,
i'm planning a trip to japan from 12/21/21 until 1/4/22. from what i read on this forum, japanese people do a lot of traveling around new years and that it would be best to try to avoid train travel from 12/29-1/2. i've been to japan before and did the golden route (tokyo, kyoto/osaka, plus hiroshima) but going with my 13 year old this time so i want to include tokyo disney/disney sea. we're from california so i don't need to spend more than 2 days at disney.
here's what i have so far:
12/21: arrive at kansai in pm (flying in and out of kansai is fixed)
12/22: train to tokyo. stay in maihama
12/23-24: disneyland/disney sea (likely to be the least busy days per crowd calendar)
12/25-12/28: tokyo
??
12/30-1/4: kyoto
i'd like some help in deciding what to do 12/28-12/30. because it's winter, i'd like to experience something unique to the season. here are some options i'm considering:
1. flying from haneda to sapporo on 12/28 then flying from sapporo to kansai on 12/30 to minimize long crowded train trips. is flying really any better?
2. taking the train to mie prefecture to see nabana no sato park illuminations.
3. taking the train to nagano, shirakawago for snow. are the trains just as crowded going from nagano to kyoto as they would be coming from tokyo?
4. going to hiroshima/miyajima. not really unique but we can fly to hiroshima from haneda then fly into kansai.
what do you think of the options and do you have any alternate suggestions? obviously, everything is dependent on covid so if not this year, will plan for next year! :)

kimono over sized is difficult to purchase. you will need to study more.

we have rental kimono houses in kyoto for tourist attraction. all of those kimonos are very cheap stuff. our ladies never wear those kimonoes in kyoto. homonngi (formal visit standard) is from
80,000 yen only for the cloth at isatan kyoto and needed to tailor costed about 100,000 yen. still cloth may have problem of width. if your wife size needs wider cloth, tailored cloth will be yyyyyyy. english is difficut for tailor kimono houses since they have only japanese customers.

it makes a circle around central tokyo.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g298184-i861-k13471981-First_Time_Going_to_Tokyo_Pretty_Anxious_About_Taking_the-Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html,First Time Going to Tokyo - Pretty Anxious About Taking the,Bargainhunter,US,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bargainhunter?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,100,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,100,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,20000,"[""['good',"", ""'read',"", ""'3',"", ""'dimensional',"", ""'map',"", ""'map',"", ""'train',"", ""'station',"", ""'particularly',"", ""'useful',"", ""'color',"", ""'cod',"", ""'english',"", ""'sign',"", ""'everywhere',"", ""'train',"", ""'subway',"", ""'station',"", ""'easily',"", ""'able',"", ""'way',"", ""'keep',"", ""'mind',"", ""'shinkansen',"", ""'train',"", ""'special',"", ""'area',"", ""'separate',"", ""'local',"", ""'train',"", ""'two',"", ""'adjacent',"", ""'train',"", ""'station',"", ""'good',"", ""'idea',"", ""'name',"", ""'final',"", ""'station',"", ""'train',"", ""'route',"", ""'train',"", ""'subways',"", ""'tokyo',"", ""'crowd',"", ""'commute',"", ""'time',"", ""'try',"", ""'avoid',"", ""'10',"", ""'wwwhyperdiacom',"", ""'plan',"", ""'route',"", ""'hyperdia',"", ""'help',"", ""'simplest',"", ""'route',"", ""'route',"", ""'train',"", ""'timetable',"", ""'interval',"", ""'timetable',"", ""'schedule',"", ""'intermediate',"", ""'station',"", ""'local',"", ""'trip',"", ""'tokyo',"", ""'suica',"", ""'pasmo',"", ""'ic',"", ""'card',"", ""'calculate',"", ""'deduct',"", ""'fare',"", ""'plenty',"", ""'videos',"", ""'youtube',"", ""'show',"", ""'interiors',"", ""'train',"", ""'station',"", ""'example',"", ""'map',"", ""'jr',"", ""'japan',"", ""'rail',"", ""'yamanote',"", ""'line',"", ""'circle',"", ""'central',"", ""'tokyo']""]",True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

@kohji a, thank you for noticing my photo. it is from the longhua temple, one of the most wonderful places in shanghai. do you think he is perhaps not an object of worship, but a wanderer?",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g298564-i2712-k13553894-An_Evening_in_Kyoto-Kyoto_Kyoto_Prefecture_Kinki.html,An Evening in Kyoto?,toolworker,"Tiburon, CA",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/toolworker?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,100,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,100,0,0,0,100,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,30000,"[""['suggestions',"", ""'four',"", ""'five',"", ""'people',"", ""'kyoto',"", ""'14',"", ""'wife',"", ""'stay',"", ""'three',"", ""'days',"", ""'hotel',"", ""'main',"", ""'train',"", ""'station',"", ""'cherry',"", ""'blossom',"", ""'time',"", ""'higashiyama',"", ""'sound',"", ""'good',"", ""'place',"", ""'visit',"", ""'see',"", ""'open',"", ""'past',"", ""'5',"", ""'close',"", ""'sammyfd',"", ""'suggestion',"", ""'cruise',"", ""'overnight',"", ""'hong',"", ""'kong',"", ""'visit',"", ""'many',"", ""'time',"", ""'late',"", ""'march',"", ""'climate',"", ""'warm',"", ""'sakura',"", ""'kohji',"", ""'notice',"", ""'photo',"", ""'longhua',"", ""'temple',"", ""'one',"", ""'wonderful',"", ""'place',"", ""'shanghai',"", ""'object',"", ""'worship',"", ""'wanderer']""]",True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

thanks much","hello,
we (family of 4, 2 adults 2 teens) will be in japan in march 2022. during out visit the sumo matches are taking place in osaka. we would like to watch one. however i'm not clear on how the tickets worked. from what i've been reading it seems like you buy the ticket for the whole day of the match and you get to watch any or all the matches from beginning to end on that day. is this correct? is there a way to watch just one and pay for one or is the only way to buy the tickets for the entire day? also for a family simply interested in sumo wrestling as an experience would you recommend one of these matches or watching a practice in a stadium?

from aso we went to nagasaki and explored the peace park. it was the anniversary of the atomic bomb and there were many people and we watched the peace memorial which was very emotional.
we had to go back to tokyo then and we never got to beppu so i can't say anything about that.

for hotels, do not book anything that you cannot cancel for a full refund.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g298184-i861-k13308857-Pre_cruise_hotel-Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html,Pre cruise hotel,edofva,Asia,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/edofva?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,300,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,134,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,38978,"[""['impression',"", ""'cruise',"", ""'flight',"", ""'book',"", ""'cannot',"", ""'cancel',"", ""'penalty',"", ""'may',"", ""'mistake',"", ""'cruise',"", ""'book',"", ""'book',"", ""'time',"", ""'big',"", ""'fan',"", ""'future',"", ""'travel',"", ""'credit',"", ""'crystal',"", ""'ball',"", ""'americans',"", ""'japan',"", ""'april',"", ""'less',"", ""'20',"", ""'hotels',"", ""'book',"", ""'cannot',"", ""'cancel',"", ""'full',"", ""'refund']""]",True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

if route best way. best route including gilis ubud ubud - gilis - nusa penida - “down south”.
this efficient fastboats routes times.
e.g. amed - gilis - nusa lembongan - “kuta sanur flying home”.
always best bali mainland night flight. fastboats canceled certain times year sea conditions cause bali “coastguard” stop boats operating.
fastboats
you book fastboats bali. generally best discounts booking locally. often 50% advertised online price. e.g. amed book tourist booth street two departure. gili next legs.
gilis penida
even normal times limited services.
 provide services “all way round”. e.g. ubud gilis penida “southern bali”.
they, fastboat services, include free shared transfer ubud padangbai departure gilis return “southern bali” hotel.
they past flash sales “2 1” 24hrs tickets half price. solo traveler way tickets basket halfprice.
they’re best company world bali. people cruising queen mary complain.
none companies bother crossings used work trawlers cornwall younger days.
bali ekajaya choice want “direct” service (they stop nusa lembongan) gilis.
there number companies gilis - nusa lembongan hassle getting penida pain.
you main landing area jungutbatu yellow bridge cenigan, hire local boatman across toya pakeh.
penida “southern bali”
there numerous companies offering services daily penida sanur/serangan lots choice. include free dropoff service.
generally going to/from toya pakeh harbour/beach.
note: fastboat companies include free pickup dropoff services penida need arrange transport to/from accommodation to/from fastboat dock.","hi,
if that is your route it is not the best way. the best route when including gilis and ubud is to do ubud - gilis - nusa penida - “down south”.
this is the most efficient use of fastboats routes and times.
e.g. we do amed - gilis - nusa lembongan - “kuta or sanur before flying home”.
always best to be on bali mainland the night before a flight. fastboats do get canceled and certain times of year sea conditions can cause the bali “coastguard” to stop all boats from operating.
fastboats
you can book all your fastboats once in bali. you generally get the best discounts by booking locally. often 50% off advertised online price. e.g. when in amed we just book at a tourist booth on the street the say or two before departure. once on gili t we do the same for the next legs.
gilis to penida
even in normal times there are limited services.
 provide services “all the way round”. e.g. you can go from ubud to gilis to penida to “southern bali”.
they, like all fastboat services, will include free shared transfer from ubud to padangbai for departure to gilis and on return to “southern bali” will get you to your hotel.
they have in the past had flash sales “2 for 1” where for 24hrs you can get tickets half price. even as a solo traveler there is a way to get all the tickets in the basket and get all halfprice.
they’re not the best company in the world but this is bali. some people think they will be cruising on the queen mary and complain.
none of the companies bother me or crossings but then again i used to work on trawlers off cornwall in my younger days.
bali ekajaya is really your only choice if you want a “direct” service (they stop at nusa lembongan) from gilis.
there are a number of companies that do gilis - nusa lembongan but then you have the hassle of getting to penida which is a bit of a pain.
you have to get from the main landing area in jungutbatu to the yellow bridge at cenigan, hire a local boatman to take you across to toya pakeh.
penida to “southern bali”
there are numerous companies offering 3 or 4 services daily from penida to sanur/serangan so lots of choice. they will include free dropoff service.
generally all going to/from toya pakeh harbour/beach.
note: no fastboat companies include free pickup or dropoff services on penida itself so you will need to arrange your own transport to/from your accommodation to get to/from fastboat dock.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g297694-i9161-k13475372-Nusa_Penida_to_Gili_meno_ferry-Denpasar_Bali.html,Nusa Penida to Gili meno ferry ?,NotaPigsty,DE,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NotaPigsty?tab=forum,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,100.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,100,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,100,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,100,0,0,0,100,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,50000,"[""['route',"", ""'way',"", ""'route',"", ""'include',"", ""'gilis',"", ""'ubud',"", ""'ubud',"", ""'gilis',"", ""'nusa',"", ""'penida',"", ""'“down',"", ""'south”',"", ""'efficient',"", ""'fastboats',"", ""'rout',"", ""'time',"", ""'eg',"", ""'amed',"", ""'gilis',"", ""'nusa',"", ""'lembongan',"", ""'“kuta',"", ""'sanur',"", ""'fly',"", ""'home”',"", ""'bali',"", ""'mainland',"", ""'night',"", ""'flight',"", ""'fastboats',"", ""'cancel',"", ""'certain',"", ""'time',"", ""'sea',"", ""'cause',"", ""'bali',"", ""'“coastguard”',"", ""'stop',"", ""'boat',"", ""'operate',"", ""'fastboats',"", ""'book',"", ""'fastboats',"", ""'bali',"", ""'generally',"", ""'discount',"", ""'book',"", ""'locally',"", ""'50',"", ""'advertise',"", ""'online',"", ""'price',"", ""'eg',"", ""'amed',"", ""'book',"", ""'tourist',"", ""'booth',"", ""'street',"", ""'two',"", ""'departure',"", ""'gili',"", ""'legs',"", ""'gilis',"", ""'penida',"", ""'normal',"", ""'time',"", ""'limit',"", ""'service',"", ""'provide',"", ""'service',"", ""'“all',"", ""'way',"", ""'round”',"", ""'eg',"", ""'ubud',"", ""'gilis',"", ""'penida',"", ""'“southern',"", ""'bali”',"", ""'fastboat',"", ""'service',"", ""'include',"", ""'free',"", ""'share',"", ""'transfer',"", ""'ubud',"", ""'padangbai',"", ""'departure',"", ""'gilis',"", ""'“southern',"", ""'bali”',"", ""'hotel',"", ""'past',"", ""'flash',"", ""'sales',"", ""'“2',"", ""'1”',"", ""'24hrs',"", ""'ticket',"", ""'half',"", ""'price',"", ""'solo',"", ""'traveler',"", ""'way',"", ""'ticket',"", ""'basket',"", ""'halfprice',"", ""'they’re',"", ""'company',"", ""'world',"", ""'bali',"", ""'people',"", ""'cruise',"", ""'queen',"", ""'mary',"", ""'complain',"", ""'none',"", ""'company',"", ""'bother',"", ""'cross',"", ""'work',"", ""'trawlers',"", ""'cornwall',"", ""'younger',"", ""'days',"", ""'bali',"", ""'ekajaya',"", ""'choice',"", ""'“direct”',"", ""'service',"", ""'stop',"", ""'nusa',"", ""'lembongan',"", ""'gilis',"", ""'number',"", ""'company',"", ""'gilis',"", ""'nusa',"", ""'lembongan',"", ""'hassle',"", ""'penida',"", ""'pain',"", ""'main',"", ""'land',"", ""'area',"", ""'jungutbatu',"", ""'yellow',"", ""'bridge',"", ""'cenigan',"", ""'hire',"", ""'local',"", ""'boatman',"", ""'toya',"", ""'pakeh',"", ""'penida',"", ""'“southern',"", ""'bali”',"", ""'numerous',"", ""'company',"", ""'3',"", ""'4',"", ""'service',"", ""'daily',"", ""'penida',"", ""'sanur',"", ""'serangan',"", ""'lot',"", ""'choice',"", ""'include',"", ""'free',"", ""'dropoff',"", ""'service',"", ""'generally',"", ""'toya',"", ""'pakeh',"", ""'harbour',"", ""'beach',"", ""'note',"", ""'fastboat',"", ""'company',"", ""'include',"", ""'free',"", ""'pickup',"", ""'dropoff',"", ""'service',"", ""'penida',"", ""'arrange',"", ""'transport',"", ""'accommodation',"", ""'fastboat',"", ""'dock']""]",True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

stayed in this onsen ryokan takumi-no-yado yoshimatsu back in 2009.

check out also hakone hotel adjacent to the lake cruise pier - newer so no experience.

in koyasan, most rooms in temple stays do not have own toilet, let alone bath/shower, that's why it's even smaller at 16sqm. however, not having a toilet is a big no for my wife. thus, we stayed in this room in ichijo-in.

we have booked most of the accomodation aprt from glencoe/fort william
its just the 2 of us in a small car and, whilst we may use some of the roads on the nc500, we are a bit worried how busy it may be so if there are any recommendations for alternate (but interesting/scenic) routes we would be grateful. we are hoping the midges will be reduced at that time (and kids returned but also think it will be popular for those without schoolkids!)
with our route and bealach na ba roa, is there a particular start/finish recommend?
many thanks for any advice. really looking forward to this trip.",tripadvisor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g186485-i107-k13624457-NC500_14_day_itinerary-Scotland.html,NC500 14 day itinerary,daniel j,0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/V2467NLdanielj?tab=forum,0,0,100,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,100,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,100,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,100,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,100,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,50000,"[""['hello',"", ""'plan',"", ""'counterclockwise',"", ""'trip',"", ""'see',"", ""'way',"", ""'early',"", ""'september',"", ""'feedback',"", ""'bristol',"", ""'start',"", ""'carlisle',"", ""'inverness',"", ""'thurso',"", ""'chanonry',"", ""'point',"", ""'fortrose',"", ""'dunrobin',"", ""'castle',"", ""'skerray',"", ""'nuclear',"", ""'research',"", ""'dounreay',"", ""'site',"", ""'fresgoe',"", ""'harbour',"", ""'sandside',"", ""'bay',"", ""'dunnet',"", ""'head',"", ""'skerray',"", ""'cape',"", ""'wrath',"", ""'lighthouse',"", ""'frm',"", ""'east',"", ""'keodale',"", ""'pier',"", ""'inver',"", ""'lockinver',"", ""'inver',"", ""'lockinver',"", ""'ullapool',"", ""'boat',"", ""'trip',"", ""'sheerwater',"", ""'cruise',"", ""'gairloch',"", ""'plockton',"", ""'bealach',"", ""'na',"", ""'ba',"", ""'roa',"", ""'isle',"", ""'skye',"", ""'isle',"", ""'skye',"", ""'glencoe',"", ""'fort',"", ""'william',"", ""'via',"", ""'skyfall',"", ""'road',"", ""'glasgow',"", ""'home',"", ""'book',"", ""'accomodation',"", ""'aprt',"", ""'glencoe',"", ""'fort',"", ""'william',"", ""'2',"", ""'small',"", ""'car',"", ""'whilst',"", ""'may',"", ""'roads',"", ""'nc500',"", ""'worry',"", ""'busy',"", ""'may',"", ""'recommendations',"", ""'alternate',"", ""'interest',"", ""'scenic',"", ""'rout',"", ""'grateful',"", ""'hop',"", ""'midges',"", ""'reduce',"", ""'time',"", ""'kid',"", ""'popular',"", ""'schoolkids',"", ""'route',"", ""'bealach',"", ""'na',"", ""'ba',"", ""'roa',"", ""'particular',"", ""'start',"", ""'finish',"", ""'recommend',"", ""'many',"", ""'advice',"", ""'trip']""]",True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

let plans, please.","leuca's suggestion is a good one with regard to flying into another city, sightseeing there, then travelling on to london (and then southampton). a potential hiccough is if cadmaam and partner plan to travel with 'cruise luggage' - eg two checked bags each plus one piece of hand baggage.
even with that, if they're willing to wrangle their bags or arrange for assistance if needed, travelling by rail from any of the cities mentioned above to london need not be arduous and would give the opportunity to have two bases and travel from each.
must your accommodation be an airbnb? there are both serviced flats and other reliable booking agents with the advantage of knowing the full price at the time of booking and (for serviced flats) having staff on hand as well.
if you've been looking at flats with airbnb and have found locations in kensington then not only is the rbk&c fairly large but it may be used rather loosely as a descriptor. the area is west of central london and whilst very popular with some visitors there are other equally desirable areas in the city centre.
